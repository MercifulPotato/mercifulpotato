If you want to build the actual PCBs, I&#x27;d suggest starting by learning how to blink a single LED on a PCB. I have two video series that teach that:<p>* Shine on you crazy KiCad - Blink an LED using a RPi <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextualelectronics.com&#x2F;courses&#x2F;shine-on-you-crazy-kicad&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextualelectronics.com&#x2F;courses&#x2F;shine-on-you-crazy...</a><p>* Getting To Blinky - Blink an LED using a 555 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextualelectronics.com&#x2F;gtb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextualelectronics.com&#x2F;gtb</a><p>Both of those series will teach you how to use KiCad, which is open source and always improving.<p>From there, you can learn how to design in an ESP32 or similar module. Or if you&#x27;d like, there are some other courses on the CE site that show you how to build other devices.<p>As the other comments alude to, you&#x27;ll need to dive into firmware and higher level software on the web side of things. I always recommend adafruit and sparkfun boards and tutorials to get started with that quickly. Building off of a known dev board is a good way to make sure you&#x27;re actually making progress and not just troubleshooting your own hardware. Both of those companies create open source hardware, so you can take the files and use those as a reference or even as a starter project for whatever you want to build.')
