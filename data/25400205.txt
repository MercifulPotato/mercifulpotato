That let me get my feet wet by moving to v6 capable hosting and being able to send traffic to my website over the SixXS tunnel.<p>At this point, though, you may be able to find an IPv6 capable ISP and just switch to them. Your phone might also have IPv6 too, especially if it&#x27;s 4G&#x2F;LTE.<p>Any amount of exposure is better than none. If you&#x27;re using AWS, I can help you setup IPv6 in your VPC and use it with EC2 which can let you get some first hand experience. My email is in my profile if you want to take me up on that offer.')
