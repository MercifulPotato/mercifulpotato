I&#x27;m just as interested in you as hearing about customer and user success&#x2F;pain stories!<p>&gt; Worth noting that this title is primarily due to Cloudflare having switched to them from ReCAPTCHA, and Cloudflare is... well, relatively popular, to say the least.<p>That&#x27;s definitely a part of it, but we also have a number of other large sites and services that use hCaptcha to protect against bots, and more that get added every day because of our more advanced bot detection special sauce.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m curious what kind of data may exist on the experience of switching for larger providers; do the users like it? how much more&#x2F;less time do they spend solving? do they care, let alone even notice that it&#x27;s not Google&#x27;s ReCAPTCHA?<p>From what we&#x27;ve seen, the integration process is generally smooth, especially if you&#x27;re a previous reCAPTCHA user, since we keep the interface and workflow largely the same.<p>Solving is roughly the same although we have a number of other protections that irritate bot maintainers and get activated when we detect them.<p>Not sure if the majority of people are aware of the change, I&#x27;m sure some technically savvy people pick up on it more than not.<p>&gt; Regardless, as ReCAPTCHA is not only terribly annoying but also built for surveillance from the ground up, I still view this as a good improvement.<p>That&#x27;s actually one the top reasons we&#x27;ve had a lot of customers come over to us; we put a heavy emphasis on user privacy &#x2F; security, including adopting&#x2F;supporting privacy-preserving protocols (PrivacyPass, Tor), and minimal retention of data (see our data privacy policy on our site).')
