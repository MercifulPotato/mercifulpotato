FAANG also knows they are <i>not</i> hiring the  best of the best. That&#x27;s simply not possible when you&#x27;re employing 10k+ developers. Some of them are going to be less than great. Your goal at that scale is just to avoid wasting a huge amount of money on a terrible hire, and whiteboarding is decent at filtering out complete trash, but the problem is we don&#x27;t train people how to do whiteboard interviews properly, so they also filter out incredible developers who just aren&#x27;t interesting in memorizing a bunch of algorithmic tricks they&#x27;d normally just look up, but would be perfectly capable of implementing whatever.')
