I had to have a graphing programmable calculator for A levels in the 90s (16-18 year old). My college bulk bought them and sold them to us for a huge discount. I can&#x27;t remember if they were sharp or casio.

I found drawing a graph on the back of the screen in dry wipe marker,  and then popping it back in, was a hilarious trick.  People would rub like mad thinking someone had drawn it in the permanent marker (I would leave a permanent marker next to it to help them get the idea).<p>I always messed around (or snoozed)in maths class,  and still got an A. It was much later that I realised I actually had a learning difficulty...')
