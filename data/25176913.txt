ObjectiveSQL’s main differentiator compared to JPA is a JOOQ-like fluent query builder API instead of JPQL, as far as I can see after a quick scan of the project.<p>If your app does not have a requirement to be DBMS agnostic then DAO (Data Access Objects) frameworks like Spring JDBC or MyBATIS might meet your needs. If you don’t like using an Internal DSL and&#x2F;or embedding SQL in your code, then a YeSQL framework like HugSQL might work for you.<p>For a strictly typed object orient language like Java, no single data access framework style has emerged as ideal. All have to address the same issues: integrating DDL&#x2F;DML into source control, supporting different DBMSes, generating DAOs, and DDL migrations.')
