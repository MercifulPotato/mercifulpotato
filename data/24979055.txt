As a guy who was doing OSS here and there (and still got burned out by doing only a little) I completely sympathize that nobody should ever expect people to do important work for free. Absolutely.<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s a good response when somebody muses in a saddened manner &quot;I wish my favourite language was more popular&quot;. Then I can spring out of the bush and tell them why it isn&#x27;t. This doesn&#x27;t mean I expect the OSS community around the language to serve me -- of course not! But it&#x27;s a good explanation on why language X isn&#x27;t more commercially popular.')
