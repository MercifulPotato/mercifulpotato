In physics and mathematics you learn mostly tricks to get at an answer for a question, where the sole purpose of the question is entertaining students.<p>Only in my 20s I read biography&#x27;s from people like Feynman (1) and Erd√∂s (2). Great reads! Really make you exited about math or physics. I wonder if high-school teachers even know these persons. And if they do, why not talk about them?<p>(1) Surely you&#x27;re joking mr Feynman<p>(2) The man who loved only numbers')
