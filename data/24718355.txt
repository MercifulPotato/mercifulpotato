Keep in mind that &quot;free speech&quot; is not relegated to the 1st Amendment and defenses of that generally lean on supplementary law.<p>1) The free speech of the user. Again, while it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not protected within a private entity, it&#x27;s irrelevant because your protections are limited; in this case when your speech breaks another law.<p>2) The free speech of the platform. Being compelled to reveal this information really doesn&#x27;t even touch any free speech argument except a vague interpretation of shield laws. DMCA as it exists provides legal protection against the crime, of course.')
