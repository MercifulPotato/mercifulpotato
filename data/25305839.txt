I also don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s an alternative to OP considering it doesn&#x27;t even mention how to integrate the code with any database, let alone Postgres.<p>As an aside, how does your approach deal with collisions? Why would the chance of collisions be any lower than with the random approach if you&#x27;re using what seems to come down to a cryptographically secure hash function?')
