The issue is that when <i>money</i> becomes the primary motivator for getting out of bed in the morning- and ethos and pathos get thrown out of the window entirely- you get companies who don&#x27;t care about their employee&#x27;s well-being or who don&#x27;t care about the <i>people</i> on the other end of the line.')
