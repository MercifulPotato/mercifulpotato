I really like the way you type.” Another longtime agent said she couldn’t believe how many “perverted calls” she had to field on Sunday mornings. “They’d say: ‘What are you wearing? Are you naked? Can I do things to you?’ I figured they got a thrill from skipping church.”<p>What the actual fuck, people?  It is extremely creepy to call to sexually harass a customer service rep period, but to do it repeatedly is not only creepy, but it has to be extremely alarming to the customer service rep and I would hope violates some form of stalking laws.<p>The customer service reps are effectively powerless, doing degrading things to keep a minimum wage job.  Then the employer mandates that they cannot hang up on a caller.  The employer either refuses to remove harassing customers from the platform, or the customer service reps are too afraid that they&#x27;ll be fired for reporting harassing customers to actually report them.  And then along come the sexually harassing creeps, who derive sexual gratification from abusing the power imbalance created by the worker structure.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a terrible idea with far-reaching and unpredictable consequences, but these companies presumably have account information on these people.  It would make me extremely happy if Arise or the people that contract them would take a hard line and start releasing the names of people who sexually harass customer service agents, along with the &quot;quality assurance&quot; recording of the call.<p>It&#x27;s always shitty when someone uses a power differential to abuse someone else, but I had always assumed that most of those occurrences in customer service were in the form of verbal abuse because the customer is frustrated by things that are out of the representative&#x27;s control (e.g. Comcast sucks terribly, but your customer service rep can&#x27;t fix that).  It&#x27;s shitty, and people shouldn&#x27;t do it, but I can understand losing your patience when trying to navigate the quagmire that is Comcast policies.  I never envisioned that someone would _go out of their way_ to harass customer service reps, especially in a sexual sense.<p>The world might be a better place if the &quot;quality assurance recording&quot; cut both ways, and the rep could flag you as an asshole or a creep to everyone the same way you can flag a rep to their employer.')
