It is not going to make you understand the domain better or provide any other tangible benefits. If anything it is going to add negative value by distracting you from $TheChallengingConceptYouWantedToLearnInTheFirstPlace<p>If I am working on a challenging project recreationally to stretch the limits of my comfort level- say a compiler or a distributed system, the last thing I want is the cognitive overload of trying to deal with C unless I am a C expert already. When working on such projects you should be focused on grokking the problem being solved as opposed to worrying about language idiosyncrasies.<p>If you want to learn C, it should be done in an environment where it is decoupled from trying to learn another extremely challenging idea. So I definitely would not recommend someone interested in learning about distributed systems attempt to build one in C. If you are trying to learn C you probably build something that you are quite familiar with so that your focus is on learning the language and its concepts as opposed to trying to implement&#x2F;understand the ideas behind Paxos while also trying to learn safe memory management and pointer tricks.')
