If I do need to run software from two or more different OSes on the same hardware then it&#x27;s strictly preferable to run them at the same time and&#x2F;or switch between them without losing any context&#x2F;state of the software in the other OS.<p>I can do that decently with virtualization.<p>Having to reboot is a really, really big drawback that&#x27;s justified only if it&#x27;s otherwise impossible or impractical to achieve what you need - but it is possible and practical, so multiboot is not really necessary.')
