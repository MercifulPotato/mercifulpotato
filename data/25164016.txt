All 50 states &quot;require&quot; kids to be vaccinated.... but 48 states have religious exemptions.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a lot less risk to HR to not piss off a couple of politically fringe employees over something that the vast majority of employees will do voluntarily anyway, without any coercing.  Two unvaccinated employees out of hundreds probably won&#x27;t cause a problematic COVID outbreak, but they could file a lawsuit.')
