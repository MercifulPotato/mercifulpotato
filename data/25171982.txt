This just isn&#x27;t true.  He&#x27;s using every legal option available to him to investigate oddities in an election.  This is the way things should be done.<p>What&#x27;s unbelievable is that there are countless examples of first-hand accounts of voter fraud and Democrats don&#x27;t want it investigated and are outright attacking anyone for even suggesting it.<p>Governor Whitmer, for example, publicly stated that the  two people that didn&#x27;t want to certify the election were racist for doing so.  This was after they were attacked, doxxed, and shamed for only wanting an investigation into the many allegations we have been seeing since election day.  Does this sound like Democracy?  It sounds like mob tactics to me.<p>If there is no investigation, then the Democrats staged a coup and it proves all along that most people on the left don&#x27;t care about justice or fairness, they only care about being right and getting power.<p>Trump may very well have lost, but I want to ensure the future integrity of our elections.')
