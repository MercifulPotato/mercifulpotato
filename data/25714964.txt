Being able to recall certain facts and to carry out certain procedures without external assistance is sometimes&#x2F;often included in the skills you are expected to acquire as part of the course.<p>&gt; <i>If your tests are so easy they can be solved via Google, they&#x27;re pointless and it doesn&#x27;t really matter if someone is cheating in the first place.</i><p>Suppose you are learning calculus, and your instructor wants to know if you can differentiate a particular function from first principles.  This is an important skill to ensure you are ready to move to the next stage, but it&#x27;s trivial to search for it on the internet.<p>This is just one example that counters your assertion.<p>&gt; <i>If people want an honest appraisal of their skills, a mentor who focuses on a single student exclusively is much better positioned to provide it.</i><p>True.  Given the current trends in teacher numbers versus student numbers, that&#x27;s unlikely to happen.  So in the meantime we must do what we can with mass assessment, and try to make that assessment fair.  Preventing cheating is part of that.')
