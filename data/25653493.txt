During heartbleed what the world sorely lacked was a working, well maintained OpenSSL.  Had LibreSSL created one of them their thoughts would have been understandable.<p>What there was no shortage of then or now is opinionated, well maintained maintained crypto libraries.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with creating a new opinionated crypto library of course, that&#x27;s how progress is made, but they are like weeds.  By breaking backward compatibility that is what LibreSSL created, but in doing that they threw their hat into a highly competitive ring Darwin will sort out by killing almost all of the contestants.<p>But in the opinionated crypto library ring, LibreSSL is a weak entrant.  Compared to some of it&#x27;s competitors it&#x27;s just a minor polish on OpenSSL, making hardly worth of effort of switching really.  This outcome looked inevitable to me.')
