So there it is to be seen if in this case it will give similar results in humans. The mouse models that are being used, often genetically engineerd to have a certain deposition for cognitive decline, might not suffer from the same type of decline that we see in humans. The drug thus might simply be a treatment for the type of genetic disorder that the mouse model has and not have any effect of the decline see in humans.')
