To be honest, I always use an USB-Ethernet adapter instead of the built in foldable. But it&#x27;s great to have an Ethernet port for emergency use. It&#x27;s a nice notebook anyway. Very light, mate touch and pen display (a pen can be stored inside of the notebook), a lot of ports. Battery and SSD can be replaced very easy (sadly RAM not).')
