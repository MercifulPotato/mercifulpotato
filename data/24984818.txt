Or at least the way it&#x27;s done in Barcelona. I don&#x27;t know who owns the fiber (the city?), but it seems that fiber was run to every building&#x2F;apartment, and when you sign up for service with one of the ISPs, they just give you a combo ONT+router and presumably plug the other end of the fiber line into their OLT. I&#x27;m guessing all the ISPs have their OLTs together so they can swap the lines appropriately.<p>That being said, it seems the networks have a lot of congestion at the neighborhood level (equivalent to oversubscribed DOCSIS nodes), at least in my experience in several neighborhoods in Barcelona. This became much more visible when COVID hit and Netflix and such had to limit quality in Europe as a result.<p>I only have experience with Movistar and Vodafone fiber, I Haven&#x27;t used Orange&#x27;s so I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re any better.')
