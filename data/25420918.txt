That&#x27;s changing the meaning of language to make it sound worse than it really is.<p>You might argue that this data is being leaked, but that isn&#x27;t clear either.  Ads work on an auction system, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that a user clicking an ad meets a demographic.  You&#x27;d need to make a case that user data can be accurately built from buying ads alone.<p>Even if you could prove that, that&#x27;s _still_ different than the claim that Google is selling user data directly.')
