This is a more divisive issue that cuts through the US society, if anything I haven&#x27;t read too much about &quot;the other side&quot; (we all know on which side we&#x27;re in here, at least in terms of privilege&#x2F;money) on this forum (props though for the user that mentioned Christopher Lasch, I only started reading him recently and I think he was doing an excellent job of writing about this exact issue, even if his books are now 30-40 years old).')
