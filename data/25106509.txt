However, outside of the comments that have already been posted in defense of linux&#x27;s security, in the end, Linux&#x27;s relative obscurity at the moment DOES effectively lead to less viruses. Compare that to Windows, who for all the security measures they implement ultimately lead to more because it is simply more targeted. While this isn&#x27;t truly reliable security, at the moment it works better.<p>Either way, Windows compromises all of your data nonetheless. So not only are you actually getting viruses, your data&#x27;s stolen anyways. Compare that to Linux, where viruses aren&#x27;t as frequent and no ones siphoning your data. In the end, who&#x27;s better off?')
