Item(by='emteycz', descendants=None, kids=[25442058], score=None, time=1608078866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25437289, text='Could you please tell me more about this &quot;oligarchy&quot;? From my contact with the rich it seems like they want to give me lots of money so I could try some of my cool projects, not rule me - they want profit, not costs.<p>And trust me, being ruled by the 1% would give you way better chances than you got with the 51%. The 1% took money and gave us sci-fi technologies, the 51% took <i>absurdly more</i> money and gave us many problems.<p>Who&#x27;s your coronavirus counter-strike leader - Gates or Trump?<p>The rich don&#x27;t want to eat you. They don&#x27;t care about you. They want profit, just like you. They will spend a lot of it on pleasure, just like you. Nobody makes profit in the world you&#x27;re talking about, it grinds to halt, without pleasure (and freedom is connected with that) there is no point in working.<p>You can also avoid the 1%. They don&#x27;t care, and if you&#x27;re saying there are no other options then you didn&#x27;t look. Actually I recommend to try - you&#x27;ll find out that small and middle businesses exist, and they need your support now.')
