Is it prescriptive or descriptive? If it&#x27;s the former (as I took it) then we&#x27;re not talking about the USDS itself, but the USG. If it&#x27;s the latter then I defer to you, but still don&#x27;t think it solves the structural problems that makes the USDS relevant in the first place.<p>Going back to our US Special Forces team, the US Army actually did (attempt)to solve for this by simplifying the pipeline with the 18X &quot;X-Ray&quot; Program.')
