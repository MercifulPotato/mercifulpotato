If you didn&#x27;t like a newspaper or a broadcast, you stopped seeing it. They built a reputation that they had to maintain somewhat. You knew most of the time who was behind each piece.<p>Now? You see content that a lot of people dislike because it generates controversy and engagement and attacks, lies get way more exposure than truths. A lot of publications come from unknown sources, with no reputation, so they can lie without consequences. You don&#x27;t know who wrote something and the interests they might have.<p>&gt; The best and only way to defend and nurture it is education. Teach people to think for themselves, critical reading,logic and analysis.<p>What is more probable, that social media has completely changed the type of content that people see or that education has plummeted in a decade or two?<p>Education is not the solution: no single person can be educated enough to make informed decisions on all the topics they are exposed to in a single day. We don&#x27;t even have the time to do that! We need to revert the changes that social media has created in our information diet, that&#x27;s the solution. And we need to start by forcing social media companies to stop maximizing engagement over everything, show people only the content they explicitly subscribed to (no &#x27;look at this comment someone made on this post of a page you don&#x27;t follow&#x27;), and stop editorializing the priority of that content via algorithms to maximize engagement.')
