I mean, not from a technological point of view, there&#x27;s nothing holding at least Qualcomm and Samsung back.<p>The problem is the software side. Unlike Apple, all three are used to dumping <i>layers</i> of bullshit upon fossilized bullshit and then dropping that off to customers hoping no one notices that the kernel version is years old, the kernel sources and the entire BSP are nowhere even close to upstream Linux quality - ever seen Mediatek leaked Android kernels? Stay far FAR away if you value your sanity, and the others aren&#x27;t better. Security for <i>all</i> of them is an afterthought.<p>Apple created <i>everything</i> from scratch, with security in mind. I agree that Apple ain&#x27;t perfect either, but... the iPhone 4S was released 2011, it took <i>eight years</i> until the checkm8 bootrom exploit was found. The Android world doesn&#x27;t even come close.')
