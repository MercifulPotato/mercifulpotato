Item(by='seabird', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611600774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906894, text='They&#x27;re not managing this by having a huge amount of capital; what&#x27;s happening here only works under some really specific circumstances. Recent-ish short interest data had GME at ludicrous levels (over 100% of issued stock was shorted due to market maker activity). Good news on a large investment from a big name who then joins the board spurs optimistic pricing, which puts the top end of call options (which are normally pie in the sky lottery tickets) within range. Some really questionable bull decision making (WSB&#x27;s forte) gets retail investors interested, price keeps going up, and eventually all calls are in-the-money. Large market makers selling what _used_ to be absurd calls are now going to have to make good on them and start buying up stock to cover them. Stock price is going up, retail bulls are pepped up, and anybody short on GME (and there were some people that were outrageously short) is now looking down the barrel of huge losses. Short sellers need to start considering getting their hands on this stock to make good, which applies upward pressure, making other short sellers consider doing the same. This all looks good for bulls, so they&#x27;re simultaneously applying upward pressure. Market makers who didn&#x27;t learn their lesson have written more call options for strike prices that are now in range.<p>This is a perfect storm where very big players are incredibly overextended and don&#x27;t know how to deal with irresponsible&#x2F;rash decision makers. It&#x27;s not impossible for it to happen again, but these are not conditions WSB or similar peanut galleries can reliably recreate.')
