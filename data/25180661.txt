However, most effects aren&#x27;t like this. If you say &quot;this function needs randomness&quot; then you can create a pure PRNG and call the function with the PRNG providing randomness. If you say &quot;this function needs logging&quot; you can tell it to log to a string and parse&#x2F;ignore the string. If it throws an exception, you can catch the exception. Haskell even provides `unsafePerformIO`, which lets you run arbitrary computations as if they were pure.')
