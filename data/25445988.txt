They would probably see coming back in as “staff” as an unacceptable loss of status and prestige in their field. (I think that status distinction is a terrible and stupid feature of academic research but it is very deeply-ingrained as folks are socialized in PhD programs to believe that the tenure track is the only route to happiness and academic success).<p>I wish more people thought like you and very much agree that academia could benefit from an influx for folks with industry experience and programming best practices!')
