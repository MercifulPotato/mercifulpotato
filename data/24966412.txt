The nice thing about the Amiga keyboard is that it is pretty much a serial device, so it wasn&#x27;t hard to set up an Arduino Pro Micro to act as a keyboard-to-usb adapter.<p>Then I put in a Raspberry Pi with a Retropie SD card, two gamepads, a mouse, and that&#x27;s all.<p>I didn&#x27;t put a lot of effort into making it look nice, so it&#x27;s basically just a bunch of cables coming out the back of the Amiga, but at first glance it&#x27;s still an ordinary Amiga.<p>Works pretty well overall for Amiga, C64, Spectrum, Atari, and DOS games. Of course boot time is not great, and add to that the time spent navigating Retropie&#x27;s menu system, it&#x27;s all a bit of a hassle. It does work better than my actual Amiga for &quot;productivity&quot; applications because I can set it up with more memory and better networking options.')
