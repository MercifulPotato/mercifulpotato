When companies &quot;sponsor&quot; things they try to take them over, unless it&#x27;s a pure donation, which is rare. The community then drops out because a company is in control. Later the project is abandoned by then company. It&#x27;s a slow death spiral.<p>I would <i>love</i> if Guido could create a new PEP for extending modules with generic namespaces, ala Perl&#x2F;CPAN modules.<p>There aren&#x27;t 15 different libraries for doing the same thing in Perl, there&#x27;s 1. You never replace it, you extend it by making a new module in a hierarchical namespace. The same core library&#x27;s code might not change in years while new extensions can keep popping up. So even if you think Requests sucks, you can make Requests::UserAgent which inherits Requests code and extends it &#x2F; gives a better interface. And these can be written &amp; packaged by completely different authors.<p>Then maybe Pypi wouldn&#x27;t have 5,000 nearly identical yet mostly unusable modules, or modules with nonsense names.')
