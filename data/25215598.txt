Just woke up one day and said I couldn&#x27;t get in. It didn&#x27;t really give me any information and it took some searching online to see that they just blanket banned rooted devices. I was upset, but whatever.<p>A year later I got a new phone so I decided to try it again. I tried my login and it said the account didn&#x27;t exist. So I tried to make a new account with my username and said the username existed. So I tried to make a brand new account and it said my email was in use and I couldn&#x27;t use it. So I tried the forgot password&#x2F;recovery thing. Said account didn&#x27;t exist. So I gave up. Sometimes companies just do weird stuff that is hostile to users.<p>Edit: I want to add that as a big linux user I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t get into many games because of blanket anti-cheat bans. I know my cases are niche, but there are weird blanket bans.')
