You are free to use that combination as you choose, forever.<p>It’s not renting because you don’t have to pay rent to continue to use it. There may be software license restrictions, typically against modifying or reverse-engineering the software,  However, it is an error to say that those license restrictions convert your ownership into anything like a rental agreement.<p>Some digital activists say that we don’t really own the devices that we buy because of license restrictions or restricted device firmware. It’s hyperbole. We do own our devices and the copies of the software they came with, even if they came with artificial limitations.')
