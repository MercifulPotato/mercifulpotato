Chamath sounds intelligent but it’s misplaced. It’s like analyzing Black Friday stampedes with the rationality of product quality assessment, better customer service, and overall better shopping experience. No. That’s not why these people are rushing in. Black Friday stampedes are a cascading phenomenon of FOMO + price trickery. It’s a giant mob with irrational behavior. Let’s not polish it too much. WSB is a cesspool (even after sterilizing it) of awful logic and herd thinking. The real losers are going to be average Joe’s who jumped into this with their Robinhood accounts and got their savings wiped out.<p>Chamath, Naval, Elon etc all belong to the narrative of decentralization and crypto with their own vested interests. Just the other day I was listening to Naval’s interview with a New Zealand media house - dude is literally urging people to buy Bitcoin.<p>Unrelated, but I’m going full bonds&#x2F;cash after seeing the insanity today’s market is, not just GME but look at TSLA, etc. I can stay irrational longer.')
