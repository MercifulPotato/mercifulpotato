I grew up in Lahore, and there is an absence of women out of specific market places where they feel safe to go to. This is anecdotal, but if you walk from one point in a city, even Karachi, to another, you&#x27;ll encounter far more men than women.<p>Additionally, Pakistani culture conflates honor with literally the &quot;veil&quot; (_pardah_)[0]. When the motorway rape happened the Lahore Capital City Police Officer put the blame on the victim for &quot;travelling late at night without her husband&#x27;s permission&quot;.[1]<p>I&#x27;m just saying, there really is an &quot;absence of women&quot; and the reasons are cultural associations with honor and decency. Acknowledging the problem is a step towards fixing it.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Purdah" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Purdah</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dawn.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;1582117" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dawn.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;1582117</a>')
