Item(by='thu2111', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607877213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404316, text='As someone who has rationally argued against epidemiology based on finding a constant stream of severe errors in their papers, I can assure you that epidemiology is almost entirely pseudo-scientific. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever encountered a field as disastrous as this one (though I&#x27;ve never really looked at climatology).<p>Epidemiology has so many massive cultural and methodological issues you could write an entire book about it, maybe one day I will. It is absolutely <i>de rigueur</i> in this field to make predictions without ever bothering to go back after an epidemic played out to study how well those predictions matched reality. They cherry pick data at an absurd rate: if they can get a more dramatic paper by using data that&#x27;s 8 months old and based on a sample size of 7 people when they could use data published last week and which has a sample size of hundreds of thousands, they&#x27;ll happily pick the former every time. Nobody in that field will notice or care, and they&#x27;ll throw in a misleading citation or two to disguise what they&#x27;re doing. There is no code quality control: these people happily publish papers based on models filled with memory corruption errors that can&#x27;t even replicate their own output.<p>As for ideology, the fact that you can&#x27;t explain what climatology sceptics believe should give you pause for thought. You appear to be projecting: a blind devout belief in &quot;scientists&quot; (they aren&#x27;t really) is itself an ideology. Rather than engaging with the concerns of people who are pointing out problems in the published literature, you&#x27;re just blowing them off as irrational.')
