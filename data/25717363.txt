For various political discussions this year, it seems many on here believe in absolute privacy even when it&#x27;s not reasonable: ie. privacy in your own home is good but that doesn&#x27;t include being able to commit murder and be protected. Freedom of speech is good, but I don&#x27;t think it extends to political figures being able to incite violence.<p>And honestly, my comment was somewhat hyperbolic, in response to a lot of the discussion that occurred last night on this topic of Amazon vs Parler. Many people were equating the violence of Wednesday with &quot;somebody not liking us,&quot; trying to suggest that this single extreme situation is an indicator of Amazon&#x2F;big tech freely making political decisions (much like this linked article) for run of the mill things.<p>I appreciate your polite question and your critical-thinking takes in your comment history.')
