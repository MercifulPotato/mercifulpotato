Item(by='trwaway412312', descendants=None, kids=[25698450], score=None, time=1610175858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695693, text='I dont have the book to hand, but what I remember from &quot;Coup d&#x27;État: A Practical Handbook&quot;, cutting off communication lines (internal and external) is one of the first things to do in a coup. Because that severely limits the governments and attached agencies response, and confuses the members of the public in support of the incumbent. Next step is to detain all people in power opposed to you and occupy the legislative while cutting off physical halls of power to the un-initiated. Then you declare yourself as ruler (ideally using legal loop-holes available to you by controlling all, normally separated, powers). It all has to be done quickly as alternative communication lines will be established quickly and the outranged masses wont be controllable if they still have hope to restore the old regime.<p>There was a bit of talk of the storm on the Capitol to be something of a coup. But they did not cut off communication lines and lacked a lot of the organization you need to follow the coup d&#x27;Etat protocol. Although storming the Capitol was a display of power that is not in line of how I believe a democracy should be governed, but calling it a coup was a hyperbole in my opinion.<p>Putting the two together, if the president looses access to communication lines and then is being removed by the legislative and parts of the executive (vice-president), then that actually looks a lot closer to the definition of a coup as I see it.<p>Although separate ownership of all the media that is closing down on Trump would imply a coordinated shutdown of communication is close to impossible, weirdly the group-think makes it happen. And although it might not be centrally planned as it would happen in a traditional coup from the 20th century, the process is remarkably similar.<p>So I think if POTUS is removed from office now, then the US will need to get ready for a lot of disrupting semantics from the Trump supporters for a long time. Just because you cannot hear them _now_, does not mean it is solved. If there is momentum it will come back. Potentially worse. This could develop into the Dolchstoßlegende [0] of the US.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stab-in-the-back_myth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stab-in-the-back_myth</a>')
