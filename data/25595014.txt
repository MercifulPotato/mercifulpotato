Corporate income taxes are one of the worst.<p>To illustrate by example, if you were to directly tax investment activity $1 per trade, you&#x27;d kill almost exactly $1 of GDP. Nothing would be gained. Land value taxes and VATs, it turns out, are some of the best because they&#x27;re inexpensive and largely non-distortionary, and personal income taxes are somewhere in between.')
