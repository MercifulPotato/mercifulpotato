Since I use it a fair bit, I&#x27;ll use Android as an example: I generally learn a new UI pretty fast, but there are still things from Holo and earlier that I miss.  Also, Material Design that was mentioned in the post is a generally good thing in my opinion, but as they&#x27;ve tried to incorporate new widgets and things into it, its become more and more clunky to use and fugly to look at, and I personally blame incremental changes for MD 2 being shoehorned into MD 1.')
