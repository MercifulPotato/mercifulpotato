Just because it didn&#x27;t happen to you doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s uncommon.<p>I also want to point out that in this comment thread we have an unsourced rumour about someone having swelling of some description (which you&#x27;ve also repeated without a source). That isn&#x27;t even an anecdote, it&#x27;s just an flat-out evidence-free claim.')
