If they can disenfranchise millions of urban people then they will happily accept also disenfranchising a handful of rural people.&quot;<p>When you have that kind of obvious cognitive dissonance, it should be an obvious sign you believe something false.<p>On a mile-high level, two things to consider:<p>1) Your base are your core, key supporters. They&#x27;re the people who are 100% committed to voting for you, go to rallies, make small donations money, volunteer, and man phone lines. You can&#x27;t run an effective campaign without a base.<p>Trump&#x27;s base is rural America and displaced predominantly white workers in decaying manufacturing cities. Fox News swings between playing clips of democratic elites calling them &quot;privileged whites&quot; and &quot;racist redneck trash.&quot;<p>2) On a national level, in turns of number of votes, it doesn&#x27;t matter much how many people live in smaller states. Whether it&#x27;s one person or a half-million people, they get three electoral votes. Appealing to that base is a good tactic.')
