It&#x27;s pretty clear that FAANG pays a lot more than most other companies and also that SV and NY companies regularly pay 3-4x as much for medium-level engineers as US heartland and EU companies pay for very senior devs. Then there are the vast offshore body farms in east Asia where a senior dev makes 10x less than that again. Also, if you count stock compensation there must be a few early unicorn employees that made 10x FAANG levels.<p>It seems like it&#x27;d be a pretty steep power law, maybe even more so than the Spotify example from the article.')
