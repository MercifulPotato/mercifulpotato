Item(by='specialist', descendants=None, kids=[25072846], score=None, time=1605202994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25070307, text='<i>&quot;Is Cole Haan narcissistic for not offering me the shoe I want?&quot;</i><p>Yes. Absolutely.<p>First, shoes and music streaming are NOTHING alike.<p>Many products like shoes are <i>so close</i> to mass customization. Levis finally, mostly got smart about this.<p>Why can&#x27;t I reorder the exact same glasses, shoes, jeans that fit?<p>It&#x27;s mostly because of the broken feedback loops, missing backward flow of information. The designer, fashion buyer, PHB absolutely <i>knows</i> what you <i>should</i> want. Your opinion is moot.<p>Oh gosh it&#x27;d cost so much to build the infrastructure, complication, returns, we&#x27;d have to pay laborers a few pennies more blah blah blah.<p>Excuses.<p>I don&#x27;t care.<p>Just make the shoes I want and I&#x27;ll be a loyal customer forever.<p>PS- I asked LA Eyeworks to resume making the Big Bodhi (John Lennon, Steve Jobs) glasses for 20+ years. The pair I bought in the 90s were finally beyond repair. The lady I bought from said she could sell two dozen pairs overnight. I visited the original LA Eyeworks store <i>twice</i>, to make a personal appeal. Nope. Can&#x27;t be done. Not possible. (The Big Bodhi are XL size, for my big pumpkin head.)<p>PPS- Speaking of Cole Haan... I had a pair that I absolutely loved. Bought them for working conventions. Standing on that concrete all day for 3-4 days. Sucks. Think of fashionable postman shoes. Gods, I loved those shoes. LOVED THEM. Best shoes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I tried so many times to replace them. I&#x27;m so mad at Cole Haan. I LOATHE them. Apparently they were bought by Nike or something and completely went to shit.')
