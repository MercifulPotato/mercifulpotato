He started his fortune from building a company that knowingly scams people. :(</i><p>There&#x27;s plenty of possible things to criticize him for, but this seems like a weird one. PayPal was started by Confinity. He founded X.com in 99ish and they merged like a year after, but then he got the boot as CEO in a matter of, months? Weeks? Don&#x27;t remember why, but while he still owned a ton of stock he was out in management. Then Ebay bought it all in like 2002. 20 years after his departure, itself before he had any real chance to make a mark, and 18 years after being bought, seems like a bit of a stretch to hold that of all things against him?<p>Edit: also man what a crazy time, I mean it was obviously crazy even at the moment but still thinking back on the timelines it&#x27;s still wild.')
