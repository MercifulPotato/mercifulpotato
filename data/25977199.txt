Also add in the overhead of configuring a debugging system where you work in an ide and debug code running in a docker image. Doable (though many of my fellow Devs have just given up) but also takes time, probably more than to run pip and get psycopg2 installed on Macs. Also the majority of engineers probably don&#x27;t even know docker that we&#x27;ll (definitely far worse than they think they do, just like with k8s). The number of times I&#x27;ve seen Devs running webservers as root in docker containers is amazing.<p>My team insists on using Docker and against my better personal judgement I let it, but I set up the code to run locally without it. If I call the shots I&#x27;ll not use docker absolutely.')
