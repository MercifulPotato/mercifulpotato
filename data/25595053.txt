And for it to be proven someone has to do the work specifically to convince you?  Seems kind of evangelical, which is a foreign concept to me. But I’ll try, respectfully.<p>Perhaps you you look&#x2F;act younger than others.<p>Or maybe others act&#x2F;look older than you.<p>Or, maybe there’s people who exist who exaggerate the first difference between themselves and someone else to put distance between them for reasons like ego&#x2F;insecurity.<p>Instead of a lens of doubt and putting the burden of others of having to educate you, it’s also possible to meet half way  and ask.. what else could this mean that I’m not seeing?  Our brains tend to find what we put attention towards.<p>Either way I hope that helps and no offence intended.')
