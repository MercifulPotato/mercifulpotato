Item(by='liversage', descendants=None, kids=[25884319], score=None, time=1611408349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25880654, text='I want to point out that disposing resources (using the IDisposable) interface does not free memory (unless the memory isn&#x27;t managed but then it&#x27;s not related to garbage collection).<p>A System.Drawing.Image holds operating system resources (GDI+) and these resources are released when the Image instance is disposed. If the instance isn&#x27;t explicitly disposed then the finalizer will do it but this only happens when the garbage collector collects the Image instance.<p>Allocating many Image instances without disposing them might exhaust the available resources (Windows bitmap handles or whatever) but the garbage collector doesn&#x27;t see any memory pressure and does not perform any collection so the finalizer does not dispose Image instances that are no longer used.<p>The garbage collector has an API (GC.AddMemoryPressure) where an object that has unmanaged resources can signal that it&#x27;s consuming additional memory to inform the garbage collector&#x27;s decision of when to perform a collection.')
