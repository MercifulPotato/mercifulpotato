Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25120453], score=None, time=1605578577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118256, text='&gt; I thought I replied to this post, but I guess not and my reply ended up being a top-level reply, which is just as well.<p>Sorry for the confusion. We detach comments that are replies to the top comment but don&#x27;t respond to anything specific that that comment said. This is standard moderation. Sometimes we post that we did this (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20detached&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>), but not always.<p>We do this because users often post replies to the top comment on a page that aren&#x27;t really replies. Sometimes they do that because they want to get their comment higher on the page (so-called topjacking). Of course that&#x27;s not always the case.<p>Both of your posts are fine (except for the fact that they duplicate one another) but they are replies to the article, not to anything that the top comment (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25116881" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25116881</a>) specifically says. Indeed your sentence &quot;<i>I will just mention my main two quibbles to this otherwise excellent post and others like it so that other people who embark on introductory posts to Godel&#x27;s results don&#x27;t fall into the same trap.</i>&quot; makes it quite clear that your reply is to the article, not xyzzyz&#x27;s comment. That&#x27;s great! But the appropriate level for such a comment is the top level of the thread.<p>I&#x27;ve therefore done the same again and detached this subthread from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25116881" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25116881</a>.')
