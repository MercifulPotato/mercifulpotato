The time for the market to react for a product with the complexity of a mac is decades.<p>As the ecosystem grows, the cost of switching increases. Therefore market starts acting more and more inefficiently.<p>This is why countries have state intervention in such cases. And anti trust exists.<p>If the option was a mac with privacy vs a mac without privacy but $10 cheaper, I&#x27;d think the market would pick the mac with privacy. No such choice within the budget exists, and if a company has a monopoly on the ecosystem, then the market cannot react when held hostage. The cost to transition to a different ecosystem is thousands of $&#x27;s when you&#x27;ve been using a mac your entire life. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;d want to relearn many things when you get older, perhaps the sunk cost fallacy as many would define it.<p>It&#x27;s a bundled deal, it&#x27;s not like you can pick the parts you like and throw away the ones you don&#x27;t like it would be in an efficient market.<p>If even someone like me cannot be bothered to move to more privacy friendly platforms, then I don&#x27;t have hope for other people. It&#x27;s just not worth it. Until the majority face the consequences of their apathy, any action you take is fruitless. Let them taste the pain, then offer the solution.<p>I know I can be tracked. So what? I can&#x27;t verify the silicon in my device, can I? Gotta trust someone, maybe blockchain will solve the problem of trust among humans, in a verifiable way.')
