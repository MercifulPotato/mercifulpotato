A divestiture plan is erosion instead of a mud slide.<p>The swing in the stock price every day is fueled by supply and demand. The stock goes up 20c because the only person selling it wants a little more than the last sale price. It goes down 20c when someone wants to sell at the last price but the only people willing to pay that much already bought their shares. And that&#x27;s not even including what happens to stop and limit orders that trigger automatically when the stock swings just a little bit farther than people anticipated. Just a small shift changes the slope of the price trend, which may cause people to shift demand away from that stock.<p>These days, when I&#x27;m mostly hands-off with my portfolio, more of my orders expire than actually trigger. Sometimes only just missing having done so.<p>It&#x27;s part of the magic thinking about the stock market.
