At first you are surrounded with blank space, then you slowly fill it out with whatever reality rules you can think of.<p>I went with code-only approach (no binary assets) and built a primitive development environment that works in VR. Now I have a neat little virtual shed with different experiments and demo projects. Geometrical landscapes, driving &amp; flying, teleporting, various gizmos...<p>Currently I&#x27;m tweaking physics engine to work with hand tracking skeleton. Masses connected with springs turn out to be amazingly palpable even without any haptic feedback and with simple cartoonish visuals.<p>VR is already fun and we&#x27;re in for a wild ride once AR hits the market.')
