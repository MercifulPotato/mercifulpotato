After contacting a chat helper and changing the password, it was resolved. The rep said &quot;you are what makes Apple, Apple!&quot;<p>Overnight (five days ago), without any activity on my side, an ominous security lock appeared on that email account, and much effort was made with a contact at Apple who required my phone number with a call-back, and almost did not clear up the condition. I do not own a &quot;smart&quot; phone here in California! It was obvious that they are connecting phone numbers with data profiles, which I have assiduously avoided for a decade. Why was the first contact not sufficient, and why add insult to injury with  smarmy customer praise, only to then do exactly the opposite of what was said?  yuck<p>edit-  I am furious about the whole thing. I did nothing to start this, and use the email for super-ordinary things. It seems obvious that some tipping point has been reached within Apple Inc., such that two-factor authentication with or without consent, is now more important than customer satisfaction and good-will.')
