Item(by='nickelcitymario', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608315982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457423, text='I don&#x27;t think I misunderstand the terminology at all.<p>My point was that &quot;free as in freedom&quot; implies free as in price. That&#x27;s literally what I said.<p>I do acknowledge that I appear to be in disagreement with many people about what GNU&#x27;s point is when they insist &quot;it&#x27;s not about price&quot;.<p>To me, &quot;it&#x27;s not about price&quot; means you&#x27;re trying to say that price has nothing to do with freedom.<p>For others, &quot;it&#x27;s not about price&quot; simply means that&#x27;s not the focus, or not the only point, or not the main point. Which is a fair and perhaps more accurate understanding of GNU&#x27;s point.<p>I could very well be mistaken about GNU&#x27;s intent. Judging by the amount of downvotes I&#x27;m getting, I&#x27;m clearly in a minority. But I remain unconvinced.')
