Just another one to consider. Which one is the best depends on use case.<p>I used these trees in the code that builds large sparse matrices from something else. The domain was CAM&#x2F;CAE, it was finite elements. As a nice side effect, with one tree per row I was able to parallelize the construction of that matrix, as different CPU cores can update different rows of the matrix in parallel.')
