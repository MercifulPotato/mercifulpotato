There&#x27;s a difference between what <i>feels</i> to be the case and what <i>is</i>.<p>Social media are about emotional impulses and endorphin triggers, not rationality or reality. Conflating the two is undermining societies across the world.<p>The American right isn&#x27;t being censored in general. It&#x27;s a vehicle for disinformation, to a somewhat greater degree than the American left. It&#x27;s mainly that disinformation that&#x27;s being censored on social media. In other media: those are as segregated between the two parties as they have been for decades.<p>As far as de-platforming, review bombing and the like: it&#x27;s not the right being excluded, it&#x27;s anyone who doesn&#x27;t conform to the fringe left&#x27;s concepts of orthodoxy and political correctness. You know, the &quot;woke&quot; crowd.<p>What happened at the Capitol was not the result of mass de-platforming and censorship. It was the result of ideological self-isolation, ignorance of historical context (among other things) and blindly parroting partisan talking points without exercising critical thought. This has been happening since Vietnam, before social media or even the Internet were invented. It culminated in the election of Trump, the emergence of Proud Boys, BLM and Antifa, the state of particularly the GOP and yesterday&#x27;s events.<p>For all the so-called differences between the two sides in American politics, they share a surprising amount of traits: ideological bubbles, authoritarian leanings, tribal sentiments, demonising the other side, distrust in corporate media and feeling oppressed&#x2F;disenfranchised. There&#x27;s at least a hint to the shared American subconscious there.')
