It&#x27;s not a lot, but I decided to give away five copies of my programming ebook to the internet on Twitter.<p>Any other creators out there, I can say that it&#x27;s a great feeling to do some random giving. I don&#x27;t mean today specifically, but in general.<p>Stay healthy and may 2021 be a better year for all of us!')
