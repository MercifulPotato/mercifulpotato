Cache it&#x27;s amazing... unless you need keys something more complex than key value, e.g. multiple keys, invalidate by pattern etc... So ... not so good actually.<p>2. Pubsub doesn&#x27;t sale really good, and that&#x27;a a real limitation<p>3. The new pubsub is purely a copy of Kafka ( they admit that in docs) but in a much less supported, and feature rich version.<p>So despite I&#x27;m still using Redis in my Day today, as of 2020 I don&#x27;t see redis in any new setup.')
