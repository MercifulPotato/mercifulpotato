Item(by='afavour', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611107187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841445, text='&quot;Thousands of data points&quot; sounds awfully scientific. Can you show me the dataset? Or are you using the word &quot;data&quot; in a more abstract sense here?<p>I&#x27;m not well versed enough to know if what you say about &#x2F;r&#x2F;uk or &#x2F;r&#x2F;europe is true, but I&#x27;m quite sure &#x2F;r&#x2F;askhistorians is not the only well run subreddit on the site. You&#x27;re just picking examples of subreddits you say are badly run and using them as evidence that all other subs should suffer because of them. Doesn&#x27;t sound scientific at all.<p>&gt; They should not even get filters imo. If it makes their job harder, then so be it.<p>&gt; That being said, one sub that I&#x27;ve found really nicely monitored is the r&#x2F;casualuk sub. Politics is a strict no no, and they have some sort of bot to filter out such content based on keywords.<p>You don&#x27;t see the incoherence in these two statements? It sounds a lot like your actual complaint here is that you don&#x27;t like perceived persecution of your personal politics, and if moderation doesn&#x27;t touch that then you have no problem with it at all.')
