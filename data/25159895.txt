But it&#x27;s pretty low bandwidth for most purposes to communicate basic facts in the absence of interaction. I for one rarely listen to recordings of meetings I miss and I assume I&#x27;m pretty typical. For many purposes I&#x27;d much prefer a 1 page email.<p>It&#x27;s like all the how-tos on the Internet that don&#x27;t really have a visual component but are a video anyway.')
