It might be the theoretical playbook, but if others aren&#x27;t doing this in practice then Apple are worthy of credit for pulling it off.<p>1 - accelerators for specific things aren&#x27;t new, and lots of processors have an H264 accelerator, but Apple seems to be pushing this a bit further than others. Even low power vs high power cores doesn&#x27;t seem to be something others are doing much of. 2 - I don&#x27;t know enough about. 3 - Apple has put a ton of FP units on this seemingly for JS performance, anyone else could be doing that, it&#x27;s not a big spoiler to know that people run a lot of JS now, and yet the M1 has more FP units than any other consumer CPU. This knowledge about the software workloads seems to be beyond what others are working on.<p>It seems to be more than just the 5nm process, not least because the A14 generation is the first 5nm chip but Apple&#x27;s chips have been well respected back to 7 and 10nm for similar reasons.<p>Caveat, very much a layman on this, but it seems like Apple are executing that playbook significantly better than others.')
