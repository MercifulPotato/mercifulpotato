It&#x27;s hugely frustrating.<p>If you&#x27;re using Gnome then it&#x27;s a relatively easy (free, ethically sound, painless, etc) process to switch to, say, KDE, and enjoy pleasant file explorer&#x2F;pickers.<p>If you&#x27;re forced to use Microsoft Windows (say for work) then you are stuck with this particular broken toilet.')
