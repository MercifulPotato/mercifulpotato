Knowing this steered me in a good direction.<p>My first app with very small success handled Access databases locally on Android.  As I had the first app which could do that, I released it in four days with very few features, but blurbs saying to contact me if they wanted more features.  The lesson here is what people wanted.  In my mind, I was thinking of how to handle tough technical challenges and new features with domain specific functionality.  But what people want was simple.  A recently opened files menu.  To expand database browsing to database searching.  To then expand searching to allow case insensitive searches.  To again expand searching to allow wildcards.  This was all fairly simple, the features I thought people wanted were much more complex.  I would not have learned this lesson if the market had been more mature, if people had another option to use.<p>I did other niche apps without lessons learned other than that niche markets are small.<p>Then I had my success (for me a consistent $2000+ in revenue a month without much maintenance work needed on my end meant success). The difference between my success and the previous apps I did was I aimed for a broad mass market, not a niche one, and there were some significant competitors.  This is a startup lesson that is heard often - don&#x27;t aim for a niche market just to avoid competition. There were two main differentiators for me - my app was a book reader, but I did a lot of work to make sure it was easy to browse, search and download tens of thousands of Project Gutenberg books (which I hosted for speed).  The other differentiator is I focused on EFIGS languages, not just English, so I was #1 result for libro and libros (books in Spanish) for a long time, and also did well in France, Germany, Italy etc.  Project Gutenberg having done the legwork of a supply of many foreign language books helped.<p>So the main lesson was to aim for the mass market for the Android form factor, and try to find a way to differentiate from competition.  People appreciated my niche Access database app, but it took some weeks for me to make $20 advertising revenue from it.  Many more people wanted to read Alice in Wonderland and other books.')
