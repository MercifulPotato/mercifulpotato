Eliminating 230 doesn’t eliminate free speech, it eliminates centralized socialization. This is a good thing for the future of the internet, and for the future of the United States.<p>And I further disagree that curated or editorialized content falls within the purview of this law. If you curate what I see, you are a publisher. If you editorialize what I see, you are a publisher.<p>This law was intended to allow sites to delete abusive or illegal content without being sued. It’s now being used by big tech to curate what you see, with no user control, and to editorialize content. This behavior absolutely should not be protected under Section 230.<p>At minimum, this section needs to be amended to exclude curated content and editorialized content.')
