Only the BulkPurchaseDiscountStrategy knows whether it&#x27;s 9 or 10 that&#x27;s the trigger. Maybe it varies based on time of day or for certain customers.<p>&gt; I would refer to these tests as &quot;integration tests&quot; although the language is poor here.<p>Agreed, it&#x27;s a discussion I&#x27;m having at my job now, I havn&#x27;t found particularly great wording. &quot;Functional&quot; testing still doesn&#x27;t quite work right.<p>&gt; Integration tests do not replace unit tests, they should just be taking a lot of the load.<p>Agreed on the first part. Integration tests are valuable, but I think they&#x27;re more fragile.<p>Writing them is, IMO&#x2F;IME, slower and more difficult.<p>As for the linked tweet, it&#x27;s the &quot;mostly integration&quot; part that I disagree with.')
