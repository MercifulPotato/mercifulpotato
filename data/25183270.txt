Right now, I&#x27;m more than happy to grab a new credit card with an amazing bonus point offer, put through the required spend and then churn to another provider in a couple of months. Normally nets me some fancy gadgets round the house each year I wouldn&#x27;t have bought otherwise (Dyson vacuum etc.). My caveats are:\n(1) Being thoughtful about where&#x2F; what I spend on the card. Nothing to revealing or illuminating (routine spend at local grocery etc.)\n(2) Being willing to pull the plug as soon as I think the sophistication of the card provider is material. This is still a while away in Australia despite the fairly progressive&#x2F; digital banking industry e.g., few banks can easily enrich their data with geo location of the merchant where the transaction took place (but this will be the norm soon)\n(3) Churning to a mix of institutions so that my spend is spread over time and never holding other products at the same institution (so they have no idea on my deposits etc.)<p>For other elements of my data I am relatively hard line - it&#x27;s too hard to value the privacy&#x2F; money breakeven and my approach is always to withhold wherever possible. In the long run this tends to net me on right side of any scandal even if I am a laggard on some social trend or convenience')
