After all, there are fewer branches to consider.<p>Unfortunately, as someone who stopped working with pointers a long time ago, my mind has to work in overdrive to understand any implementation that relies on a &quot;pointer to a pointer&quot;. Hence why the first implementation is far easier for me to understand.<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see many debates around which solution is simpler, but these debates will never reach a resolution. Depending on the skills and experiences you bring to the table, different people will objectively benefit from very different implementations.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.rajivprab.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;abstractions-are-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.rajivprab.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;abstractions-are-i...</a>')
