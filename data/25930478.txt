Assembling the second one is finding the same parts and doing the same assembly steps, the thinking is already sorted out.<p>Building the first Model A means going back to the drawing board because it&#x27;s not the same. Even at a smaller scope building a F150 with an updated exhaust means going back to the drawing board for that part, and making sure it keeps working correctly with all the other parts.<p>It turns out that with software, once you have one fully assembled &quot;F150&quot;, a second identical one can be created out of thin air (cp &#x2F; git clone &#x2F; run compiler &#x2F; whatevs). So the effort is ~100% on thinking and design.<p>Now why would you want 2..n F150s? Because you want to have them in the wild doing something useful. That&#x27;s making them available and distributing them and having more of these as needs increase. That&#x27;s cp&#x27;ing your code onto servers and deploying and running it and making it reachable. You do that with DigitalOcean, Chef, K8S, or whatever AWS service du jour, and hopefully you automate as much of it as possible just like we have car factories with robots to not build these with human hands.<p>Deploying and spinning up more of that same code so that it keeps up with the scale of whatever it needs to do... that&#x27;s ops, and that&#x27;s basically the only part of software that remotely resembles industrial work. The part before that is development, as in &quot;research &amp; development&quot;, and that&#x27;s 100% not &quot;industrial&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.<p>Thinking that developing software is like building a house or a car and &quot;industrialising&quot; things with waterfall or Kanban on SCRUM and pulling bogus time estimates to completion is the biggest lie ever, just like pulling out the next vaccine or devising a new maths theorem cannot have any reliable time to completion because you&#x27;re constantly up against unknown unknowns. This field just flat out doesn&#x27;t work that way.')
