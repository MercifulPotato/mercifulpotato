For the most part, we don&#x27;t even know which patents Redmond is actually licensing.</i><p>Few things are as scummy as legal extortion, with contract clauses that prevent that extortion from becoming public. At the very least, refusal to reveal which patents something allegedly infringes, should result in any subsequent patent claims being invalidated. It&#x27;s like being accused of trespassing, but the property owner refuses to tell you what part of the land is theirs.')
