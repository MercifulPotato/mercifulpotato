Item(by='gjulianm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607542032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362575, text='&gt; but I can&#x27;t say I blame Youtube for doing it<p>I do blame them, the same way I blame all social networks. People have always been ready to spread fringe content, but usually that content didn&#x27;t go too far. What has changed now? Easy: the interest of social networks and platforms in having interactions above all. They have created the algorithms that give relevance to anything that creates activity, no matter what kind of activity (criticism and praise are evaluated the same). They have created the platforms that give a massive reach to anyone, real or not, with a single identity or with a hundred ones. They have created the incentives to favor views above content. They have created the models that will spam you with the &quot;next thing you need to see&quot; no matter what effect that has on you.<p>Now all of this is just a patch. The next conspiracy theory will come along, and the slightest effort at fighting it will just give it more relevance. The problem here is them. If they want to be serious about this, they should start by removing the mechanisms that are being abused. Of course, that would hurt their income and they don&#x27;t care that much about the issue of misinformation.')
