First at this point I don&#x27;t trust many of the groups and institutions, because I have repeatedly over the past 4 years seen various groups act in a concerted manner to try and slander, libel and misrepresent trump while trying to drive people to be angry and irrational about. There have been multiple I&#x27;ve seen things reported that I&#x27;ve said to myself. &quot;Okay if Trump really said that then I am way off of supporting him&quot; but then I go look at the actual remarks and it is radically different from what he said. Any else remember a 2 week news cycle on whether or not cofeve was a racist dog whistle? Ultimately at the end of this my faith in mant previously authoritative institutions has been shaken.<p>Also I don&#x27;t know anyone that is claiming &quot;widespread&quot; voter fraud, no one believes there was &quot;widespread&quot; voter fraud in this election it was targeted specific voter fraud at particular places and counties is the contention. Everyone knew going into this what states needed to be won for biden to win. Many of these states were decided by less than 10,000 votes.<p>In response to your contention about being against making it easier to vote. The fact of the matter is that the more room for error in the voting process the less likely people are to trust the outcome. If we imagine for a second we lived in a non-Covid world right now and there everyone voted like normal do you believe as many people would doubt the veracity of the election? Ultimately I consider integrity of the election to be of higher value than ease of access, because it doesn&#x27;t matter who gets to vote if no one trusts the process.<p>Again you asked how could a good faith conservative believe this. This is how, I could be wrong I could be off, but that is how I see things right now. Maybe that&#x27;ll change but for right now that&#x27;s how I reconcile being good faith and conservative.')
