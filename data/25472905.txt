Similar to how consumer technology goods get much less expensive, but have many more defects and issues. That &quot;race to the bottom&quot; makes cheap things cheaper, but makes more expensive things more difficult to make. I don&#x27;t know what that phenomenon is called specifically, but it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ve been frustrated by in nearly every industry and product category.')
