I have no claim on that but that’s not what I interpreted from the above post. The relevant point of comparison is what Apple can negotiate with Intel for its chips versus M1 total cost.<p>Please also note that a modern non-M1 Mac included a TSMC silicon (T2) on a similar order of complexity (A10-class) anyway that’s no longer present (albeit at a larger node).')
