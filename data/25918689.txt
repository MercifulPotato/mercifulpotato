We make it easy to trade cryptocurrency on any exchange, track all your wallets, and learn about every coin.<p>As early team members at Acorns, we helped build out the broker-dealer and RIA, but crypto has been a brand new challenge.<p>We originally got started in crypto while we were running a small consultancy, when three of our clients broke their contracts in the same month: one went bankrupt, one got sued by an ex-partner, and one was out of state--and decided he didn&#x27;t have to pay us.<p>That&#x27;s when we learned about smart contracts and got excited about the idea of automated escrow. Volatility aside, if the technology had been widespread it would have saved us $30k and a lot of grief.<p>But frankly, getting into crypto is a pain. Finance is complicated enough when dealing with simple equities, but add in secret keys and exchange hacks and you quickly find yourself in chaos. Despite this, 55% of crypto owners report that crypto was their very first investment, ever.<p>Even as a pro, managing a portfolio of currencies is torturous. Our average client has at least 3 exchange accounts and manages more than 10 different wallets. And the most common tool they all use to track it is Excel--ouch.<p>That&#x27;s exactly why we built Hedgehog.<p>If you don&#x27;t feel confident in crypto, our Learn content and Discover page are there to help get you up to speed, and we also include loads of research on hundreds of tokens and their teams, with unique wikis for all 1800+ actively traded tokens.<p>We&#x27;re already helping individuals and investment firms manage $2.8 million in cryptocurrency, and we&#x27;ve processed $45k in trades since opening up trading to the public around Christmas.<p>I&#x27;m incredibly proud of the team, and I&#x27;m excited to hear your thoughts. We&#x27;re dying to ship features you want. Happy to answer any questions and take feedback here!<p>-Colton, Taylor, and Jason')
