Item(by='covidthrow', descendants=None, kids=[25980369], score=None, time=1612110545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978916, text='I&#x27;m with you on this: the <i>very</i> occasional loud fun should, in my very humble opinion, be allowed to happen without fuss.<p>Where I&#x27;m from, about 3-4 times a year, people in the area will go ape wild on fireworks until the wee hours of the morning. It&#x27;s not legal from both a safety and noise standpoint, but they do it responsibly, so who cares? They won&#x27;t bust out the high-flying rockets unless we&#x27;ve had rain, they do it in their various mowed fields, they do it sober, etc.<p>So the only real complaint would be that it goes on until 2-3am. With a baby the last few years and agitated dogs, it&#x27;s not exactly &quot;fun&quot; for us, but... I can live a few nights of the year with interrupted sleep while my neighbors have a grand time celebrating.<p>It would be one thing if their celebrations caused conflict or extremely dangerous situations—one could argue shooting fireworks qualifies—but my personal risk analysis of their behavior doesn&#x27;t leave me concerned. Nobody is driving home drunk, getting into fights, etc.<p>So who cares?<p>I&#x27;m sure someone in this world may be inclined to complain about odor when I smoke meats a few times a year (I don&#x27;t think any sorts live around me though), but I would expect the same kind of consideration that I extend others when they very seldomly and gently encroach on my comfort.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is this: it seems that the parent poster is the self-centered one. I acknowledge that I don&#x27;t understand their situation, but I find it exceedingly difficult to fathom a scenario in which a single night a year is severely detrimental to their own well-being.<p>Let them have fun, ffs! What kind of party pooper is so self involved to do this sort of passive aggressive attack? I&#x27;m sorry, parent, but I think maybe <i>you&#x27;re</i> the bad neighbor.')
