The city doesn&#x27;t have any available land, therefore you need to demolish existing structures and build higher. There is a loud and vocal community of activists that refuse to allow new construction because of gentrification. Additionally, many won&#x27;t allow retail businesses that are not local. SF prevents retail chains of a certain size in some neighborhoods. Also, the city has a law that allows any resident to challenge a change of use permit or new construction, no matter where they live in the city. These cases ultimately come up before the Board of Supervisors which tend to attach requirements and restrictions for construction leading to expensive delays.')
