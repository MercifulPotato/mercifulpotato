They _did_ have sewers, with public toilets attached to them, and they probably didn’t have that many horses wandering the street, as the horse collar hadn’t been invented yet. Ancient Rome presumably wasn’t as bad as a large medieval city (which wouldn’t usually have had proper sewers), and things may even have gotten worse later on, because at a certain point bathing really did become a lot less common in much of Europe (due to weird medical beliefs and religious objection to public bathhouses).')
