If you want to &quot;boost&quot; a &quot;signal&quot; to get people to make trades the way you want them to, you are presumptively engaged in market manipulation.  Stop this madness.<p>I know it&#x27;s popular to think that big evil hedge funds do these tricks too, and imagine yourself as a hero.  But that&#x27;s not really the way they work[1].  And it&#x27;s not right when they do it, and it&#x27;s not right here either.  Yes, people go to jail for stuff like this.<p>I&#x27;ll take my downvotes now.  But this really is just mass hysteria in our community right now.<p>[1] And to the extent it is, they tend to have much better opsec and don&#x27;t post the logs of their criminal conspiracies on open internet forums.')
