Item(by='jnurmine', descendants=None, kids=[24771925, 24771988], score=None, time=1602630982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770679, text='&gt;&gt; no amount of evidence would be enough or credible enough or good enough or acceptable enough etc\n&gt;Where did you get that?<p>Well, from the fact that there usually <i>is</i> evidence provided, and such evidence usually gets denied by either the high-ranking state officials, and&#x2F;or state-controlled media and&#x2F;or state-controlled social media accounts and&#x2F;or similar channels. In any case the real evidence is seldom presented at all, let alone neutrally, on the state-controlled channels.<p>Just look at the cases I listed. There is no doubt of deep involvement. Yet in all cases the provided evidence is &quot;fantasy&quot; or &quot;fabrications&quot; or ultimately a &quot;NATO plot&quot; or even waved off as some form of totally illogical hatred of the Russian people (!).<p>Then there&#x27;s also the counter-evidences, which are often clumsy attempts to add confusion to the real evidences and to delegitimize the original claims of guilt. For example, in the MH17 case, there was satellite imagery of a fighter jet firing missiles and so on. In the Navalny nerve agent poisoning case there was a &quot;phone call between Warsaw and Berlin&quot;.<p>Sadly, and predictably, denial of presented evidence is the usual reaction and a deliberate part of the communication strategy employed.<p>On one hand, it is completely logical, because accepting the evidence would be an admission of guilt and such a thing never seems to be done. On the other hand, given their ongoing track record of aggressive and rather expansionist rhetoric, bullying their neighbouring countries and the tendency of always denying evidence, even for things which are clearly their doings, why should any nation think Russia is innocent if something points to Russia?<p>&gt; the most striking part is always the total absence of any evidence at all<p>No, there is no &quot;total absence of evidence&quot;. There is usually plenty of evidence. And from this we go back to the deliberate strategy of rejecting evidence; the evidence is always somehow lacking, incomplete, inaccurate, etc. or that there is no evidence at all.<p>The bottom line is that unfortunately Russia is perceived to be like a bully against its neighbouring countries in its West and North-West because of its words and actions. If it stopped doing the needless bullying, maybe those neighbouring countries wouldn&#x27;t be so fast to point the finger at Russia.')
