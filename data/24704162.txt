How long do you think it will take for your job to be offshored? Maybe few years? This will give incentive to increase offshoring to the companies. Mind you - offshoring is not equal to outsourcing. If you work for a Global company like Google or GE - good luck. Stopping immigration is like stopping oxygen ... this economy will slowly stagnate and be overtaken by other more efficient economies. Either you try to dial back time and go back to the 40s with no globalization OR you have to push forward with globalization to level the playing field for all countries wether it is a developed or emerging country and achieve a parity in salary which makes the American workers competitive in the Global scale. Do we have the guts to make the second choice because certainly we cannot go back to the 40s and aim for global dominance via WW3.')
