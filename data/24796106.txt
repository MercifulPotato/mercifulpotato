Item(by='Brian_K_White', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602808607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786561, text='I used to do that for my own company just for our own customers to use via our software.<p>It was just a single T1 line in a data center with a linux box with a Dialogic T1 card installed, running HylaFax+.<p>This got us 24 high speed fax lines on an internet connected server, and all the application servers sent jobs to it via the regular hylafax+ client (which is like a slightly customized ftp)<p>The users didn&#x27;t use the fax lines directly to send arbitrary files or prints from their desktops, they just used our software which had the option to fax things it generated. For some years there were several thousand end users and back end automated processes generating tons of faxes 24&#x2F;7 and it hardly ever scratched the surface of that T1, because it often sent the faxes faster than the traditional 9600. Many times the receiving machine could receive at 14.4, and sometimes even at 19.2 or 33.6, and the server queing up the jobs and using all 24 lines could chew through a lot fast, so even when there was a lot of jobs, they didn&#x27;t pole up much.<p>That wasn&#x27;t a generic service but an integrated one, but it&#x27;s only a small step from there to having a generic email-to-fax gateway&#x2F;service, or a web front end, or even a virtual printer driver that faxes instead.<p>I used to use a generic service like that for a while also. Not one I made, someone else&#x27;s service. Unity Fax, later renamed to fax.com. It worked like I just said, you could send and receive by email, or through their web site. They gave you your own phone number that anyone sending a fax to that number was sent to your email (or your inbox on the web site).<p>There are many such services just like that.')
