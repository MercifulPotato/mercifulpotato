The key insight here is that for every person selling the stock and making millions, somoene has to be buying.  There&#x27;s a narrative about short squeezes forcing a small number of hedge funds to buy stock, but in practice many of the people buying the stock at the inflated price are retail investors hoping to get rich quick. A few retail investors will get rich quick, but that money will come from the people who join the party late and can&#x27;t get out before the price drops back to earth.<p>The trading stops and laws that exist to prevent this kind of wild volatility are basically because for 90% of people, this is not good. By the time your parents read about this in the paper and log into their TD Ameritrade accounts to &quot;invest&quot;, they&#x27;ll be in that group of people left holding the bag.')
