Jiro&#x27;s oldest son is expected to eventually take over Jiro&#x27;s sushi place, so as a result essentially is toiling for his father into old age. On the other hand, somewhat ironically Jiro&#x27;s younger son actually has more freedom, so he strikes out on his own pretty early and has his own very successful sushi joint.<p>IIRC, that&#x27;s wrong.  The documentary said that Japanese tradition is that the eldest son inherits the father&#x27;s business.  Jiro has two sons, so he created a <i>clone</i> of his business for the second.  They&#x27;re literally exactly the same layout except mirror images of each other.<p>The poignant thing that I remember is that the person who actually made the sushi for the reviewer who made the restaurant famous was not Jiro, but his son.  And the wondrous thing was that the enterprise wasn&#x27;t about chasing fame or fortune, but about being dedicated to excelling at a craft.')
