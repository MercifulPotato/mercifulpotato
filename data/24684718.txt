He didn’t say that was a morally- wrong decision, only that you miss out on a deeply human, deeply significant experience which has a profound effect on how you view the world.<p>The choice to do either of these should be made freely and consciously, and each of them can be culturally restricted or promoted in healthy or unhealthy ways.  The line between “healthy” and “unhealthy” is going to be different for everyone.  I think a good thought exercise is to compare and contrast modern psychedelic advocacy with the 20th century’s sexual revolution.')
