Even the USDA thinks indoor&#x2F;controlled vertical farming is key in the future [1]<p>For other planets, we will have to have vertical or underground farming and controlled conditions.<p>As more and more land on Earth gets used and population increases, climate changes, soil is more and more less fertile, the only way to meet that demand is indoor, up or down.<p>Even industries like marijuana, where hydroponics and farming is more indoors, much of that is indoors and can be vertical.<p>There are lots of innovations yet to be made that will make it more of a possibility and ultimately a necessity [2].<p>When it comes down to it, growing in controlled conditions is easier and less risky, growing outdoors is harder. Though it doesn&#x27;t work for all right now, the areas it works for those elements are key.<p>Even growing a single plant indoors versus outdoors, so much less to think about in controlled conditions. Farmers can be wiped out with a flood, or an insect, all of those things are less risky indoors where possible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;vertical-farming-future" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;vertical-farming-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vertical_farming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vertical_farming</a>')
