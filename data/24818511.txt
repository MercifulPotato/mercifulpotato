In-industry we call this &quot;managed&quot; and &quot;un-managed&quot; hosting.<p>All of my issues actually happened with &quot;managed&quot; hosting 10 years ago. I was in my early-20&#x27;s and still getting my feet underneath me as a Linux administrator so having a backup was something I advocated when I was provisioning our hosting.<p>Frankly, it was probably pretty good for career development because their support staff was clueless with anything Linux administration, and if I needed an answer quick I was my only trustworthy resource. Like - basic LAMP (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, PHP) was completely beyond them even though that was the bread and butter of their business.<p>I haven&#x27;t sprung for &quot;managed&quot; hosting ever since because it just taught me that I was the best person to handle my interests... and it lit a fire under my butt to get way better at my Linux chops!')
