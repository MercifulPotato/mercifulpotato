I think that the &quot;reporting&quot; use-case is well served by Snowflake&#x2F;BigQuery&#x2F;etc, but I do think that operational use-cases are left behind by batch-based transformation models.<p>The thing I&#x27;m most excited about in materialize is the ability to create Sinks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;materialize.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sql&#x2F;create-sink&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;materialize.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sql&#x2F;create-sink&#x2F;</a>). The combination of 1) streaming transformations over realtime source data and 2) streaming outputs into external systems feels like the way of the future IMO.<p>I saw a dbt-materialize plugin (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jwills&#x2F;dbt-materialize" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jwills&#x2F;dbt-materialize</a>) out there in the wild. My guess is it&#x27;s not ready for primetime yet, but would love to bake support for materialize into dbt when the time is right :)')
