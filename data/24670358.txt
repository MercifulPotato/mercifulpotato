You simply didn&#x27;t earn any off that one person<p>It&#x27;s tricky to quantify the financial harm (such as lost sales, higher prices, reduced production, cost of anti-piracy enforcement, etc.) caused by or associated with piracy, as well as the effect on the economy as a whole.<p>Overall, it seems likely to be a small redistribution of wealth from companies to pirates, where the benefit to pirates is likely greater than the loss to companies, since each pirate copy is not necessarily a lost sale. This overall benefit (mainly accruing to pirates) is probably offset somewhat by slightly reduced sales and production as well as the cost of anti-piracy enforcement.')
