A photon of a given wavelength (energy) has the same momentum regardless of medium it&#x27;s traveling in, it&#x27;s also not affected by the center of momentum as in there is never a frame of reference where the rest mass of a photon is equal to its relativistic mass for a given observer.<p>In general you shouldn&#x27;t consider relativistic mass to be a &quot;thing&quot; for either massless massive particles, special relativity is useful, but it doesn&#x27;t attempt to describe the universe as we know it.<p>As for GR well it&#x27;s more complicated, GR doesn&#x27;t give you the ability to calculate the invariant mass of a given system, that&#x27;s arguably one of its weakest points or at least it&#x27;s weirder points it&#x27;s also where people try to poke holes in the theory looking for violations of the equivalence principle.')
