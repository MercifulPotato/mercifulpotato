Item(by='znpy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611611651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903596, text='Some months ago I started using mediawiki to keep a private knowledge base.<p>It&#x27;s way smaller than the OP, but since I&#x27;m the only reader, I can allow my self to be either as detailed as I need or just have some quick notes and some link.<p>After moving together with my SO, she started creating pages too, and we often work together on page (it&#x27;s a joy to save the recipes we like the most).<p>And I must say... It&#x27;s a pleasure. As soon as I do something neat, I feel the urge to take a note bout it so that I don&#x27;t have to google stuff again in the future.<p>When I wonder the details about that thing I did in the past... My wiki immediately helps me. It&#x27;s really a joy.<p>And since we moved together in our own place, it kinda helps with the house too. We started collecting pdf manuals of all the appliances we bought, and by using PDF widgets I can get a quick view of the manual from my browser without downloading it.<p>All things about the building, city council, public administrations? We&#x27;ve got pages for that.<p>To-do lists? A wiki page is not the first thing one would think about, but as long as you&#x27;re checking it out from time to time it works just fine.<p>Page trees? Just use sub-pages, maybe categories too.<p>The visual editor is a godsend.<p>Media shows nicely in pages (think of wikipedia).<p>So to sum up:<p>1. keep your own wiki, even a private one.<p>2. you don&#x27;t necessarily need the &quot;best&quot; system, you need a system that works well on things you care about (I care for the documental management aspect of mediawiki and the easy&#x2F;functional inclusion of various media -- i was initially tempted to just buy a confluence self-hosted license).')
