Any project that’s basically infeasible for one person to undertake given their skillset or simple “physics,” and by that I mean the physics of time and money.<p>For example, I feel like there should be a good alternative to iCloud and Google photos with agnostic storage and native apps for all platforms and extremely simple self-hosting.<p>Now should I go out and start this project because it’s the one I’m most afraid to start? Hell no. I know that these are products built by teams of dozens over decades. I also don’t even know how to write a hello world mobile app. So I could waste years of my life doing this, and all I’d get out of it would be an alternative to a product that costs me $4 a month.<p>Or maybe instead of an open source project I could try to start a company to do this. I could raise funding and build a team to do this - congratulations, I now have a high-churn consumer facing product that at most makes $10 per customer per month with high support costs.<p>So, I guess what I’m saying is, fear is only one factor involved in decision-making, and other logical pieces or information can feed into fear. Sometimes, many times, fear is based off of a project idea being legitimately a bad idea.')
