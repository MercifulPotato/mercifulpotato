This is a common problem to most streaming services (except, as noted, GeForce Now) while GP was claiming that Stadia was the worst game streaming service. Honestly, of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s the best; games look good, perform well, and control with no noticable latency.<p>Now, why do I buy games on Stadia if I agree with your point about not owning the game? Well, portability is sometimes nice. I can throw a Chromecast in my bag and play a game anywhere. It&#x27;s a supplement to how I game, but I don&#x27;t think it will ever be the primary way.')
