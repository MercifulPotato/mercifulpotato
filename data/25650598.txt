But you are right, no point overthinking and complicating it. I will upgrade to a dual sim phone and use the other sim for new stranger communication.<p>Though I think a lot of people do want to see IG, just to get an idea about your life, friends etc. Like a way to know about you without prodding too much. I anyway don&#x27;t use IG anymore so I just say I don&#x27;t have it, and as you said they seem to be fine with it.')
