The only actual font here is a binary file in an asset attached to a release tag, and it&#x27;s only provided in one font format.<p>* Not all systems will work with this, as the idea of font fallback is not universal.  The built-in terminal emulators in the FreeBSD kernel and in Linux only load one font at any given time.  (I&#x27;ve written a user-space terminal emulator with the goal of providing a user-space workalike for those terminal emulators, which does have font fallback mechanisms, but kernel built-in terminal emulators forego the ability to have multiple fonts and a lot of other things for obvious reasons.)<p>* 200 by 200 is excessive for some uses.  Not everything is a GUI program talking to a display server with a font manager on the side.  The font tools for Linux&#x27;s built-in terminal emulator limit glyph bitmaps to 32 by 32, for example.
