It even has its own (four-layer) model but the IETF People aren&#x27;t nearly as interested in layering as the OSI people were:<p>Layering Considered Harmful<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc3439#section-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc3439#section-3</a><p>Point being, this is why people who know history get a bit perturbed when people insist on shoving TCP&#x2F;IP into the OSI Model, or, worse, insist that TCP&#x2F;IP &quot;implements&quot; OSI somehow. OSI had its chance, it lost, and now we use POP and SMTP for email, not X.400.')
