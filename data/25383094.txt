Not surprising, since it&#x27;s written as a cryptic poem.<p>The question is meant more as a metaphor for a larger problem american culture (in particular) has with lumping a lot of very different things together as &quot;disabilities&quot; and the problems that stem from doing that.<p>Like the author said, if a (public) building is physically inaccessible by a significant subset of the population then the building design is the thing that needs attention and reconsideration not the people.<p>In other words, we should put more effort into designing systems and things that accommodate differences rather than asking people to identify with the poorly defined and highly contextual term &quot;disabled&quot; as if that&#x27;s a solution to anything.<p>That&#x27;s closer to the point of the article, despite going over and over the question for the sake of poetry.')
