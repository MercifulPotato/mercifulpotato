I remember a similar HN comment a while back and couldn&#x27;t see how this would happen with a static site.<p>If you store 1 GB of data in total in us-east-1 and serve 1 request <i>per second</i> with an average size of 100 KB, it would cost $1.28 per month[1] for S3 and $25.38 for CF without the free tier, $20.24 total with the free tier. That&#x27;s much more than most static websites ever store and ever serve. I use S3 &amp; CloudFront for multiple static websites (all low-traffic, &lt; 50 pages with some images) and the cost per site for hosting is less than I pay to renew its domain each year.<p>I used to do these by hand and finally started using Hugo a few years ago, and love the solution. Everything is simple to set up, the SSL cert is free and auto-renewed, the performance is great and the costs are negligible. For the vast majority of small static websites and even up to thousands of page views a day I find this approach ideal.
