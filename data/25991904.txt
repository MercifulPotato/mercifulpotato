The system is so flawed that I try to stay away from it as much as possible. In the civil system, you can probably eventually get justice if you spend a lot of money on lawyers and wait for months&#x2F;years. The criminal branch seems way more random and with any bad luck (being in a wrong place at the wrong time) you can go to jail while being completely innocent, and even the best lawyers won&#x27;t help you. So, my strategy is to avoid risky behaviors (incl. starting businesses) to minimize my contact surface with the justice system.')
