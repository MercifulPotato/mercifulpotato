It feels as if there&#x27;s been a &quot;junk foodification&quot; of digital bytes (pun intended), with our relationship with digital content becoming more ephemeral. For all the miles we scroll and all the paths of URLs we travel, there is very little that allows us to create maps, way-markers or any form of bread-crumbs for us to follow later.<p>Because we don&#x27;t have good ways to store away content for later, it sometimes feel like we are cursed to wander aimlessly, creating files and bookmarks here and there, with no real aim or purpose. On the one hand, the world of cyberspace is almost seductive for its incredible vastness and on the other, it is almost paralyzing to explore without a proper set of tools.<p>I am anxious for tools designed to assist in forging paths through digital ecosystems, establishing a map over digital landscapes that enable me to understand the land, and how to travel through it. Without these, it feels that whatever I do will radically fall short of what I could do.')
