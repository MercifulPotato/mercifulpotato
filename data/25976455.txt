But a 600WH starter battery (which is lead-acid and doesn&#x27;t really like being run down) is no match for a 60,000WH lithium traction battery.<p>A typical four-camera 360Â° setup probably draws about 5-10 watts, more if it&#x27;s performing motion-detection on the images. You&#x27;d be unwise to run that overnight on a typical starter battery, especially in winter. But it&#x27;s a drop in the bucket for an EV.<p>(Personally I think this is an egregious amount of &quot;vampire power&quot; to waste if nothing&#x27;s going on, but apparently a lot of things are going on.)')
