Item(by='pdabbadabba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610463013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747031, text='&gt;  The US does not have [libel laws] at the federal level<p>It&#x27;s true--I think--that there is no federal libel statute (though perhaps someone can correct me on this), but that assertion is misleading without a little more context. Whether it is a state or federal law doesn&#x27;t really mean much in the American legal system. In the U.S., most such laws are state, not federal laws. That doesn&#x27;t make them less important or enforceable.<p>Every state that I know of recognizes libel as a tort (i.e., you can sue someone for it), and you can do so in federal court if the required ents for federal jurisdiction are met. (In this case, probably that the plaintiff and defendant are from different states.) And, in any case, what&#x27;s wrong with state courts? A judgement in a state court is just as good as one in federal court.')
