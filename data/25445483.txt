Browsers launch as a side effect of something else.  For example clicking on a link inside LinkedIn, Telegram, bank app help, etc.<p>When that happens, if a separate app gets opened it&#x27;s usually Firefox Focus that opens for me, so I guess that means the default URL handler is Firefox Focus (must have set it years ago) and it&#x27;s not being changed by software updates.')
