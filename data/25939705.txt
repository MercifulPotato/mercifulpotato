With change comes unpredictability and unpredictability results in perceived (and potentially actual ) instability of systems that have been in place for millennia.<p>If you&#x27;re lucky you won&#x27;t experience any crisis first-hand but for the ones experiencing things like random famines, water-shortages, poverty and conflict, all due to &quot;climate-connected adverse effects here and there in the world&quot;, it will be life-altering.<p>It&#x27;s not going to be the end of the World, and while the climate changes may be very long-term, life will adapt and overcome. That doesn&#x27;t mean that humanity won&#x27;t have a very rough ride going forward.')
