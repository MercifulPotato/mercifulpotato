Leadership has shared a timeline with us (as in “it will happen in the next x years”).<p>Do I like having illiquid equity? No, but the company has opportunities to access some liquidity. More importantly, working for about five years will have provided me more than many people earn in a career. I want many of the things described here to change like anyone else does, but it would be nuts to call it a bad deal.<p>I have a feeling people use this kind of junky thinking (“stock options are lottery tickets to be valued at $0”) to justify starting their own thing instead of being employed.
