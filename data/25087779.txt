If he listens to you, you have won over your brother.<p>If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses.<p>If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen even to the church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector.<p>Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</i>')
