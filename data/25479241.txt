Item(by='tyg13', descendants=None, kids=[25480566], score=None, time=1608399581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478854, text='The problem with the &quot;tolerate being offended&quot; attitude is that it favors those doing the offending, and is only possible so long as we are capable of tolerance. Certainly there are somethings which are so offensive so as to be completely intolerable. Calling for my or my family&#x27;s death or mistreatment, for example.<p>The pendulum is swinging because for a long time, people have felt downtrodden by those who told them they had no choice but to tolerate such treatment, and now those same downtrodden realize they no longer have to be. In the age of the internet, people have found commonality in their oppression, solidarity in their commonality, and strength in their solidarity.<p>That being said, the pendulum has swung a bit too far in many places. Persecuting small offenses is surely a form of oppression in and of itself. Careful consideration must be taken as to what is actually intolerable and what is simply offensive. The latter is excusable, the former is, well, intolerable.')
