There were no calls from Obama asking state legislators to overturn the results, or for VP Biden to just ignore state results and pick electors himself in Jan 2017 (which is what many Republicans are asking Pence to do next week).<p>Later there was an investigation into Russian election interference authorized by Trump’s own Attorney General.

In the infamous Helsinki meeting, he first destroyed interpreter’s notes to hide what was discussed, then took Putin’s side against the American intelligence community. My own feeling is that he did all this simply out of a weird admiration for Putin — but with this much smoke, it’s not surprising there were questions about a fire.')
