But do you think it&#x27;s always going to be the side that you think is right that is going to be doing the exposing, threatening, and attacking?  Or do you think that the side that is evil might use such tactics?  Might even be <i>more</i> likely to do so?<p>You even might look at this as grounds for questioning which side is evil - or at least for deciding that the good side has some evil people on it.')
