A bit hard to get for me.<p>There&#x27;s an old and very easy way to create a distorted image by selectively publishing the news: just ignore all the positive news and publish only negative news.<p>Many opposition channels and blogs in Russia exploit this technique. E.g. there&#x27;re some anti-Russian blogs (quite many) that publish only vivid descriptions of the most cruel crimes that happened in Russia recently. When people read mostly these blogs they get an impression that everyday life in Russia is permeated by brutal crimes and there&#x27;s no escape from villains if you step outside your apartment.<p>They&#x27;re also quite popular among Russian immigrants living in Europe and USA (my guess is that because they&#x27;re promoted in Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;YouTube search results), and they always tell me in private conversations: &quot;How can you live in such a brutal place where people are killed for no reason every day?&quot;<p>They don&#x27;t get that crime happens in every country every day, what is important is statistics: how effective is effort for fighting the crime, how big is percent of victims, etc (btw, also a rich field for statistics manipulation).<p>But these blogs do not publish fake news - they can publish only true facts. There&#x27;s enough true facts you can use to create a distorted image if you ignore all the other information.')
