Item(by='Bayart', descendants=None, kids=[25148142], score=None, time=1605781503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147179, text='&gt;The problem with an European Army is that the French or the Italians or even the Germans won&#x27;t send their young men to die at the Eastern border in order to defend Poland or Romania, it&#x27;s as simple as that<p>What makes you think that ? I often read those sorts of reactions from Eastern Europeans (yes, yes, I know Poland is in « Central Europe ») but that&#x27;s just giving us intentions we don&#x27;t have. One other trope is framing the desire for a European Army as a master plan to sell more French weaponry.<p>Speaking from a French perspective, we&#x27;d be completely comfortable sending people fight for the sake of Poland, Romania or any EU member without too much of a second thought. We already send people to Africa all the time.')
