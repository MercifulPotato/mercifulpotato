Are these still prevalent in some markets 2020? Looks like, according to really bad results in teh googs, CPUS are hot-swappable too? Is it a an extra socket on the motherboard or like some sort of franken dual-board setup?<p>I&#x27;m more curious than anything how systems like that are used or what their niche is... I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re insanely impractical for almost any conceivable purpose but what are those few cases they aren&#x27;t? What&#x27;s it like swapping out a CPU or DIMM in those? Just a lot of holding onto your butt and praying?')
