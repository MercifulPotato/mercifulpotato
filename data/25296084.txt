Lightweight (2.4 lbs) and fanless, solid 8+ hours on a charge, great for general use on chromeos, okay for Linux with built-in Crostini container.<p>I&#x27;ve had an iPad, but have never had any other Apple product.  I&#x27;ve been pretty much anti-Apple since 1979, when as a 15-year-old I bought a Radio Shack TRS-80 over the much more expensive and glitzier Apple IIe.<p>I now have a Macbook Air M1 on order.  We&#x27;ll see how it goes.  I&#x27;m sensitive to weight, prefer very light laptops.  At 2.9 lbs it will be a noticeable step back from the ux305 (2.6 lbs) and Pixelbook (2.4 lbs).  If I end up not bonding with the Macbook I plan to sell it; Apple&#x27;s generally high resale value is a factor in giving the M1 a try.')
