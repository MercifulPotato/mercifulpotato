Glad if I can do a little part to help -- It&#x27;s not that the tutorial &#x2F; guide that is there is bad, it&#x27;s just the order! I think a lot of people might try to jump in, since you can basically read protobuf&#x2F;thrift as-is, but many might not have even heard of GADTs. It might make sense to put just a <i>tiny</i> blurb of an introduction (or even a code sample like bool) on that first page.<p>I think protobuf&#x27;s main page[0] is the best example, and thrift&#x27;s[1] isn&#x27;t terrible.<p>Would probably make it easier for lazy developers like me to immediately understand what&#x27;s going on, and how to be productive.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;protocol-buffers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;protocol-buffers&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thrift.apache.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thrift.apache.org&#x2F;</a>')
