Item(by='iaw', descendants=None, kids=[24914966], score=None, time=1603856824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914743, text='&gt; rightful owners<p>When it&#x27;s the original author or within a reasonable time frame of their publication the concept of rightful owners makes sense.<p>The idea of an essentially immortal non-living entity or a 5th generation niece&#x2F;nephew being a rightful owner to a work is not a view I agree with.  Society is the background that allows works to be created, at some point control over those expressions is ceded back to society.')
