I&#x27;d pick something that looks interesting to you and it should have less than 130 pages. Since book shops might not be an option during Covid, I&#x27;d try an online book website.<p>Actually most books that I buy are either from authors that I&#x27;ve already read a lot of times (=easy reads for me) or I read an article in a magazine and a book is referenced. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t read much contemporary fiction in English, but I liked A Man&#x27;s Place from Annie Ernaux, it&#x27;s also just 96 pages')
