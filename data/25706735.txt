Could be cool for arrays or more complex data where you want to save the raw data and a record of how it gets transformed.<p>And I understand you are targeting a minimal implementation, but the concept could also apply to bigger datasets and higher level languages, e.g.<p>array_name 1 2 3 4 5 &quot;x if x%2  ==0&quot; array')
