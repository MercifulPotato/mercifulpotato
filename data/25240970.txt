Item(by='lukifer', descendants=None, kids=[25241124], score=None, time=1606601382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239655, text='&gt; CDC data says there 99.97% survival rate for all Americans between the ages of 20-49<p>First: are citizens over 49 chopped liver?<p>Second: there are roughly 129 million Americans between 20-49 [0]; taking the 99.97% number at face value, napkin math indicates 39,000 potential deaths. This is roughly equivalent to yearly car crash deaths, which is the basis for a <i>massive</i> state safety apparatus, restricting both commerce and liberty (freedom to drive 120mph). Plenty of room to debate efficacy and tradeoffs in road safety policy; but it&#x27;s arguably reasonable to justify non-zero state intervention in both cases.<p>Third: there are considerations beyond mortality rate; many survivors are expected to have ongoing health conditions and&#x2F;or shortened lifespans due to lung damage.<p>Let the record show, I think lockdowns in some regions have gone too far, while the laissez-faire approaches in other regions haven&#x27;t gone far enough. Framing the question as &quot;Lockdowns: Y&#x2F;N?&quot; is exactly the kind of simplistic narrative thinking that I&#x27;m claiming is unproductive (and ultimately downstream of political tribalism). For instance, permitting tightly-packed indoor concerts with no mitigations seems foolhardy; but allowing haircuts with masks and temperature checks has no nowhere near the same risk profile, mathematically. We have to balance a variety of concerns, include economic factors, preferably using thought-technologies like QALYs [1] and micromorts [2].<p>&gt; They also have the option to limit to eliminate their contact with others<p>This is a fantasy. While individuals have some ability to mitigate personal risk, absent a massive proactive intervention (MREs, medicine, and other essential supplies delivered by an E2E-tested supply chain, plus temporary UBI and&#x2F;or rent freezes), very few people have the means to completely cut themselves off from all outside contact for more than a few days. Anything that increases risk to grocery stockers therefore increases risk to everyone, no matter the precautions individuals take. &quot;If you have an immune disorder, you should have already prepped 18 months of resources in a bunker&quot; doesn&#x27;t pass a humanitarian sniff test.<p>[0] Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;241488&#x2F;population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;241488&#x2F;population-of-the...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quality-adjusted_life_year" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quality-adjusted_life_year</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Micromort" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Micromort</a>')
