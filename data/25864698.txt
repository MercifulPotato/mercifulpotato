I am saying the deservedly poor reputation of the NYPost is irrelevant in this case because the  reported facts are easy to independently verify.  The reputation of a newspaper counts when their reputation is what we must rely on, which is not the case here.<p>The NYPost&#x27;s source is a public filing linked elsewhere in this discussion.  If you think the NYPost has lied, point out the lie.  If you think they left something important out, point it out.  I&#x27;m guessing you cannot do either.')
