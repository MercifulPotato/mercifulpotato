One of my friends had a landlord that wouldn&#x27;t budge, so he and his wife moved to a new place (larger but with the same monthly rent, and with the first few months free).  But I&#x27;ve heard from a couple others who asked for and got rent decreases.  Unclear if their landlords were thinking about that more as a COVID hardship decrease, or a decrease reflecting the new, lower market rates.')
