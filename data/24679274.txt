It made it incredibly easy to rewrite history to move files going to different repos, then remove the history of any files not staying in a particular repo.<p>And it was <i>fast</i>. Also, being able to pass in files containing rewrite rules allowed me to easily do multiple dry-runs of the code split ahead of time so I was able to minimize the code freeze for our team.')
