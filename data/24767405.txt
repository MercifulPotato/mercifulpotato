I know my perspective is limited, but here&#x27;s my perception:<p>- Politicians at the national level often brag in the manner you describe. (I could believe it&#x27;s become less common in the last 10-20 years, but I haven&#x27;t paid careful attention.)<p>- Almost no private citizen (in my circles, at least) thinks in those terms, or at least they don&#x27;t openly speak that way. The most prevalent form of nationalism that I see amongst Americans is the feeling that various groups are unfairly disadvantaged by our national leadership&#x27;s tolerance of bad trade deals with China, or (less often) failure to protect American workers from having to compete with illegal immigrants for jobs.<p>- Also, my impression is that a large majority of Americans hold our Congress and (often) Executive branches in very low regard.')
