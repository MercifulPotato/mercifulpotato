The same thing happened to me with Python over 20 years ago and I&#x27;ve successfully (and happily) avoided that language for over 20 years because of just how unbelievably, unstoppably &quot;effervescent&quot; Python people were in the late 1990s.  If Python were 10% as good as those people said is was, it would be, by a wide margin, mankind&#x27;s greatest achievement for the next 10 millennia.<p>I get the exact same vibe from &quot;Rustaceans.&quot;')
