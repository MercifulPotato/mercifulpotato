My job is stable.<p>In the locality of &quot;the economy&quot;, I have heard multiple businesses in my area say that they are barely hanging on by a thread and will be forced to close permanently if the state forces them to shut down again.<p>People might not be dying from the shutdowns, but it sure is an uneven load we&#x27;re asking people to carry. Particularly from this high pulpit of HN, where we nearly all have cushy tech jobs where we don&#x27;t have to interact with anyone to get paid.')
