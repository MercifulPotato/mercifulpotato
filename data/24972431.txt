Super simple, and likely about the same complexity as setting up a dev environment.<p>Setting the same thing up on AWS requires slogging through the documentation of their many services, deciding what makes the most sense for you (EC2? ECS? EKS? Lambda? Fargate?), and then configuring more options with less-friendly UI than any other provider I&#x27;ve seen. If you can fully wrap your head around all those services, create a stack that makes sense, and maintain it long-term, you&#x27;re probably well on your way to being qualified for a DevOps engineer job. I can spin up a quick DigitalOcean droplet for a new project in less than half the time it&#x27;d take me to set up an EC2 instance, configure the exact amount of storage I need, and pull up 2 additional browser windows to determine the specs and pricing of different instance sizes in different regions.')
