But there is significant disinformation about what they claimed and wrote. Zero Hedge did not present their theory as definitive (read for yourself at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;man-behind-global-coronavirus-pandemic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;man-behind-global-coronavir...</a>). It was speculative, and frankly it is totally appropriate to speculate in a situation like this. Why wouldn&#x27;t a leak from a lab be feasible? Why were activists and media (and even scientists) so quick to squash any speculation or exploration or investigation about origin, when there have been numerous historical incidents where powerful governments and corporations denied culpability only to be proven wrong later when evidence came out (in some cases decades later)? There has to be an outlet for theories because hard truths often begin as open ended theories.<p>Consider as well that the CCP has <i>still</i> not permitted an international probe and site visit to this Wuhan lab. Note that in late December, a scientist said they would welcome a site visit (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-china-55364445" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-china-55364445</a>) but then when the WHO wanted to visit Wuhan to investigate, their visas were denied (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-china-55555466" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-asia-china-55555466</a>). Lastly, note that other media outlets were NOT banned for doing what Zero Hedge did (example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-02-13&#x2F;after-zero-hedge-twitter-ban-questioning-coronavirus-origins-cnbcs-eunice-yoon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-02-13&#x2F;after-zero-hedge-t...</a>).<p>&gt; This is not a left vs. right thing, it&#x27;s an issue of Parler(&#x27;s users) wanting to stuff the genie back in the bottle, they want to unsay what they have said and unpost what they have posted, because after the 6th it is extremely compromising for them to have said&#x2F;posted it.<p>It is absolutely a left versus right thing if the same standards are not being applied to both sides. I&#x27;m not sure how your statements invalidate the double standards around doxxing. One group sharing publicly-available information for the public face of an organization is considered impermissible doxxing. But another group evangelizing and disseminating unintended public disclosure of private information (location data) is okay? The latter is not just equivalent, but a significantly worse act.')
