Never has in history. Never will.<p>As long as you consider the Trump ban &quot;censorship&quot;, it appears that it did, in fact, improve matters at least once. To wit: the article you&#x27;re responding to.<p>Before the internet, it was infinitely more difficult to reach an audience. People weren&#x27;t &quot;banned&quot; or &quot;censored&quot; or &quot;canceled&quot;. They just were not published nor broadcast. If you insisted, you could maybe ditto a few hundred copies of your &#x27;zine[0]. You can still do so today.<p>And yet, democracy thrived. It was the time people came up the idea of history &quot;bending towards justice&quot;. Something that seems laughably naive today.<p>&gt; Open, honest, fair discussions are what&#x27;s going to squash them and organically strip membership.&quot;<p>That statement is just obviously disproven by very recent history and current reality. QAnon isn&#x27;t caused by some media failure to prove that George Soros isn&#x27;t actually harvesting children&#x27;s brains. It&#x27;s mass psychosis not connected to reality. To use a non-Trump example: Holocaust denial isn&#x27;t caused by a lack of relevant information.<p>[0]: Those hand-driven duplicators are where the term. &quot;crank&quot; originated, which shows their spiritual connection to today&#x27;s chaos.')
