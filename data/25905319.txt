My suspicion is many will view it as dramatically overblown.<p>Another question for residents of CA:<p>As a resident of Colorado, I&#x27;ve been very happy with my governor (Jared Polis) and his decisions with the pandemic.  He was early to implement a mask mandate, and has been super collaborative with businesses in soliciting ideas to best walk a middle ground between allowing businesses to remain open and also containing the virus and ensuring businesses aren&#x27;t acting as vectors of spread.<p>How do you rate your governor&#x27;s handling of it?  Legitimately curious.  (I really don&#x27;t care about the optics, like &quot;so and so went to this fancy restaurant&quot;, just more of a resident&#x27;s viewpoint on whether the state government is being smart or not.)')
