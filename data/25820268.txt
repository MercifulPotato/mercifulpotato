Good managers don&#x27;t cause HR-type problems, and can deal with any problems in their teams without involving HR.<p>So, yeah, kinda - management at most companies don&#x27;t want HR to be like this. The bad managers because HR keeps getting involved with them, the good ones because HR imposes restrictions that they don&#x27;t need. But HR is like this because it needs to protect the organisation from bad management.')
