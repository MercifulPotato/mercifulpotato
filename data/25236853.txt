That means it&#x27;s been telemetry for the last two years, and will likely continue to be so until the next major macOS release, approximately a year from now.<p>The fact that Apple isn&#x27;t logging the IPs any longer is irrelevant.  The data is unencrypted, and your ISP and their ISP and everyone in between can log the data.<p>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t include the Apple ID or device identity is similarly irrelevant.  The IP address also communicates unique identifiers to other services (including at Apple), so the IP address is sufficient unique identifier in this instance.  Additionally, even if one doesn&#x27;t have any access to those other records mapping the IP address to the user (held by Apple, the carrier, and many others), simply monitoring the specific set of apps that are opened (again, because the data is unencrypted) is sufficient in many cases to fingerprint and uniquely identify the device.')
