Doesn&#x27;t even work :&#x2F; I clicked register and it said &quot;Use your security key now or cancel&quot;. What does that even mean? What&#x27;s a security key? Is it a setting in my browser? I have lastpass installed, can it use that? Is it supposed to integrate with the Mac keychain somehow? Gave me no options but cancel.<p>Pretty underwhelming if that&#x27;s the future of web auth..')
