I really, really want DDG to be successful and I&#x27;m glad to know the feedback doesn&#x27;t &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null. If I might be so bold as to suggest that hiding the &quot;Send Feedback&quot; in the bottom right is a very opaque location for what is arguably a vital interaction DDG has with its users.<p>While I have an insider: I see a lot of mentions in the threads about folks who use &quot;!g&quot; or &quot;!sp&quot; -- are those counted as votes of suboptimal DDG results? I could see it going either way: it&#x27;s a bad metric for those users who just <i>default</i> to doing it, but it&#x27;s a good metric for searches that end in the frustration of a series of bad DDG results')
