If you&#x27;re not trying to improve, you&#x27;re likely stagnating or getting worse. If you&#x27;re consistently at-odds with what your customer is expecting, it may mean you should be re-assessing how you&#x27;re doing business.<p>I think ultimately it is healthy for businesses to be constantly re-evaluating whether they can do more, or do it for less. And that&#x27;s all &quot;perpetual growth&quot; means.')
