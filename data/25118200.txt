I don&#x27;t know.<p>Here&#x27;s a typical narrative that illustrates why we should be more careful about the word &quot;lockdown&quot;:<p>Alex: &quot;Sweden has successfully managed COVID19 without a lockdown.&quot;<p>Bob: &quot;Great, so we should just go and live our normal lives then.&quot;<p>Alex: &quot;Actually no. We need to cut off most social contact, ban visitors to rest homes, and work from home when possible.&quot;<p>Bob: &quot;Er, that sounds like a lockdown to me!&quot;<p>Alex: &quot;WELL ACTUALLY it&#x27;s not a lockdown as long as the government doesn&#x27;t assert the legal authority to enforce these restrictions.&quot;<p>Bob: &quot;... but the effects on health, well-being and the economy will be the same as a lockdown?&quot;<p>Alex: &quot;If everyone complies, which we expect them to, then yes, but the important thing is that we don&#x27;t call it a lockdown.&quot;')
