Most compliance issues are solved by defining a way of working that uses a project management system like Jira. Someone else read how to label a product with CE-label and HIIPA, and all I have to do is report my work in Jira. Don&#x27;t have to understand CE-labeling or HIIPA.<p>For compliance it must be possible to find who made a change, why they made that change, and how they validated and tested that change. In a heavily regulated industry like medical, it is very useful to have a tool like Jira when the audit comes up.<p>I still accept your point tough, if you need to go fast and break things (you know, innovate and prototype things), jira is a real blocker and the &quot;jira mentality&quot; slows things down, for better or worse.')
