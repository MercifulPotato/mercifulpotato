Nevertheless, I engage in all of these things. I enjoy crafting things and learning new techniques. I enjoy learning how to optimize plant growth. I enjoy reading old literature and gathering what I can from it about the historical context, linguistics, etc. \nAll of these types of things, while not &quot;productive&quot; give me additional knowledge that I can pull from in &quot;unrelated&quot; tasks.<p>In the tech world, I&#x27;d say that realistically all abstractions are leaky. So engaging in these tasks(you mentioned) <i>are</i> productive. But even more than that because abstractions are leaky this is knowledge that is <i></i>useful.<i></i> If you don&#x27;t have the knowledge of the systems underlying the abstractions you&#x27;re using it&#x27;s a footgun waiting to happen.<p>I can give an example. I had a boss that was doing some serverless work and he made an assumption about JSON. I told him in review that JSON does not respect ordering of keys. Well, he assumed it would not be a problem. It was pushed to production anyways. And a few weeks later it came back to bite him.<p>Now what happens when you don&#x27;t dig into your abstractions? You lack the knowledge to fix problems that happen at a lower level. When you&#x27;re deploying these &quot;relationships&quot; to your database provider. What happens when the machinery breaks down for replication, backups, etc? You have to sit around and wait for an expert to fix your app. Meanwhile you&#x27;re staring at your users and stonewalling.<p>No, you&#x27;re not in the hosting business, you&#x27;re not in the database tuning business, you&#x27;re not in the sysadmin business, and you&#x27;re <i></i>not<i></i> in the Ecmascript working group. Until you are. Then when you&#x27;re foisted into this role you&#x27;re a fish out of water. Specialization is for ants, but we&#x27;re humans, not ants.')
