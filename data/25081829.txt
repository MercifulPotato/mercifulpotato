(He doesn’t view himself as a member of either. A professor reaches at most a few hundred students, he told me. “You reach hundreds of thousands.”)<p>His theories are interesting, but the fact that he claims not to be part of the elite himself indicates he&#x27;s got some serious intellectual blindspots. Modern academia is one the most perfect examples of &quot;elite overproduction&quot; there is. Hundreds of thousands of doctoral students investing huge amounts of time and money to chase a relatively tiny pool of prestigious teaching and research positions.')
