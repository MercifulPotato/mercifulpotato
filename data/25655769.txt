I think that is worth highlighting. But I wouldn&#x27;t make it an &quot;or&quot; clause.<p>For context, I&#x27;ve been able to satisfy all the criteria when learning both Prolog and Erlang. They were both profoundly education experiences, but I think part of the impact of that experience came from using them to solve problems I had, and to which those languages were well suited.<p>There are many languages that will teach me important concepts, but time to devote to learning them is limited. I need a filtering&#x2F;prioritization process. The trick is to just be aware that these other languages exist, what domains they are good for, and be ready to learn them when I have the right problem.')
