Most things described as &quot;logical fallacies&quot; are informal anyway, and have nothing to do with &quot;logic&quot;: they&#x27;re not expressed in the form of a formal Quinean logical syllogism that maps out truth tables with elemental logical operators like AND, XAND, IFF etc.<p>The only work the word &quot;logic&quot; is doing here is not as a formal term but as a vague complement that approximately means something like &quot;rational.&quot; And invoking that term, or witholding it is just a personal expression of whether you like something enough to award it a merit badge that has the word &quot;logical&quot; on it. It&#x27;s just playing calvinball.<p>&gt;The second part is claiming that an opponentâ€™s lack of response to any or all of the arguments means the opponent is wrong.<p>This is just incoherent to me. Second part? The page isn&#x27;t grouped into parts. I&#x27;m assuming you mean the second half of the sentence explaining the shotgun fallacy. But the second half of the sentence isn&#x27;t expressing a second, isolated idea. The whole thing together describes a rhetorical strategy for expressing an argument that attempts to escape refutation. It&#x27;s as real as any other informal fallacy. If it falls short of qualifying for your personal complement that it&#x27;s &quot;logical&quot;, well, either you&#x27;re referring to formal logic or you&#x27;re not, and if you&#x27;re not, then this whole exercise in deeming it &quot;logical&quot; is just a game of calvinball that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with anything.')
