The method of electing the president is supposed to reflect the sovereignty of the people, with most of the electoral votes being apportioned according to population. The Great Compromise did give the small states disproportionate representation (an extra two electors, independent of population), but most electors are still tied to population.<p>The Electoral College is an anachronism. The US is far more unified now than it was in the 1780s. People move between states, and believe much more strongly in democracy than they did 240 years ago (e.g., state legislatures appointing Senators would be unthinkable now, as would denying the vote to any adult citizen). If anything, arbitrary state boundaries should play no role in how much of an impact a person&#x27;s vote has.')
