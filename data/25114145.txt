The performance is legitimately &quot;live&quot; in that he&#x27;s creating new images from scratch, and it seems clear that he&#x27;s able to build up this rich imagery from what seem like a handful of solid composable building blocks in his software.<p>I always found those performances inspiring in a similar way to how I feel the times I have visited DynamicLand. A wonderful blend of the physical medium and alternative ways of thinking about computers that produce such an interesting result, making me glad people like this exist in the world.')
