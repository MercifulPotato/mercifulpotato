Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609134837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550077, text='<i>In this same way I see your wording as calling the GP &quot;lazy&quot; even though you did not use the specific grammatical form.</i><p>I get if you see this as the same, and, burned by your chastisement by someone, world like to see the same inflicted upon another to give you a sense of fairness or let you feel your weren&#x27;t singled out. That makes sense, even tho I disagree.<p>So while I can&#x27;t vouch for or against the views of others who would chastise, I get if you see this as the same as what you were alleged to have done, but it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m not calling anyone lazy, or skeptical. And i have no set opinion on whether the commenter is lazy or skeptical. Tho i don&#x27;t think they are. However, i know very definitely how i feel about the comment, and that it just as i have said, and that is it&#x27;s lazy skeptical.<p><i>If your post is not too old by the time you see this, I suggest finding another way to word your message to get the same point across.</i><p>No. I find the way i choose here is already the best to convey my meaning, which is why i choose it. So i think perhaps you have not grasped the meaning there, which is okay, because everyone will for their own interpretation as a function of who they are at that moment. As an aside, possibly one thing in your way of seeing the meaning, and the correct form for that, is your previous experience, which you have narrated as negative, of being chastised.<p>So while I appreciate your suggestion which I see merely as trying to improve as you see it the tone of commentary on this forum, I have to reject your suggestion. And I hope you can respect that. Ultimately i think we&#x27;re both trying I think to do the same thing.')
