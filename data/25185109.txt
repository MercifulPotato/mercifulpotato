My policy: never downvote any post, and on the contrary, upvote posts that are contrary to my views but have merit and thus are worthy of consideration.<p>I wish there were better ways to highlight thought-provoking posts, yet moderation is essential. A popular voting system is better than nothing.<p>Let&#x27;s compare this with the ability to block people on Twitter just because they disagree with you. That&#x27;s stupid and not conducive to having a discussionâ€”but then again, this wasn&#x27;t the point of Twitter in the first place. At the same time, this is also a blessing for people who want to avoid negativity.<p>In the long run, ignoring problems doesn&#x27;t make them disappear. Suppressing exposure to bad ideas also comes at the cost of blocking the unpopular good ones.')
