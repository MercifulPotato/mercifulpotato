Moving from a Wiki model to a GitHub PR model actually sounds <i>worse</i> for users. They talk about, &quot;building a relationship with contributors&quot;. This could also be called, &quot;building a lot of friction for contributors&quot;.<p>With a Wiki, even non-technical users can contribute, because the editing tools are all built in.<p>But with the PR model, now contributors need to understand HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub PRs. I&#x27;ve been on GitHub for something like 10 years and I <i>still</i> have trouble figuring out PR workflows.<p>Making simple edits like grammar or punctuation fixes become significantly more effort in performing the submission than in performing the edit itself.<p>Wanting to have control over the submission process to prevent drive-by vandalism is certainly important. But that should be managed with role-based authentication and new users needing to have their edits approved by a moderator or by votes from long-term users in good standing. Once again, this sounds like the same old Mozilla line of &quot;doing the right thing for the current user experience is too hard for our developers, so we&#x27;re going to move the goalpost instead.&quot;<p>Compared to MSDN, MDN isn&#x27;t as broad, but goes a lot deeper on topics, and has much better examples. Does Microsoft wring its hands over how much running MSDN costs, to the point of considering giving it up entirely? I don&#x27;t think they do. I think they know that it&#x27;s important to keep developers on-platform, in-ecosystem, and they do that by offering a comprehensive learning resource.<p>MDN is the best online resource for learning about Web technologies. I think a large part of that is because of the relatively low friction to edit. It not making Mozilla any money is completely their own fault. They could have taken that a step further and started offering training services and events. It stretches belief that you could have such a popular resource and can&#x27;t figure out some sort of monetization strategy related to it. But, I guess, that&#x27;s another of the same, old Mozilla lines.')
