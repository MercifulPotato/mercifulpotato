I cancelled my gym membership in person at the gym many years ago - but this year 2021 I am still receiving letters, now from Inkasso where they claim I should still pay membership. I don’t even live in the country anymore, and I did cancel it in person! (That was John Reed Fitness, stay away Berliners). Call me whatever “-phobe” slur you wish, but after these experiences and more, I am never signing a contract with a German business again. No idea if AT and CH are similar.')
