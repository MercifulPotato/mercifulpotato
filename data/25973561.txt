IT believes I had something installed already that conflicted with the new OS, but they weren’t able to figure out what it was and ended up having to wipe the OS and downgrade back to Catalina.  Say what you like about M$ or Linux, but I’ve never seen an OS upgrade with so many problems in 30 years.')
