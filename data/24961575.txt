I think countries should generally not trust other countries that don&#x27;t have a strong and nearly binding interest in their stability, security, prosperity, etc. In a close multinational union like the EU, one could argue that this is currently the case, or perhaps with closely-tied countries like Australia and New Zealand. It becomes harder to justify as you move down the line, even if the US is far from an enemy of the aforementioned places. Consequently, in the other direction I don&#x27;t think the US should necessarily trust Germany with sensitive data, or Switzerland should trust Canada, etc.<p>EDIT for clarity.')
