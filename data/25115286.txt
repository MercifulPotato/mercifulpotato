This functionality (filtering Apple app traffic using Little Snitch) used to be possible before Apple made it impossible. The fact that you can still route Apple app traffic through a system-wide VPN doesn&#x27;t change that a bunch of more-selective firewalls&#x2F;VPNs have effectively been nerfed by Apple&#x27;s actions.<p>So yes, Apple is in the wrong.<p>Edit: The article headline is technically accurate (if a little clickbaity): &quot;Apple apps on Big Sur bypass firewalls and VPNs&quot;. Yes the do! Not <i>all</i> firewalls. But they bypass some of the most popular ones, like Little Snitch.')
