Violation of these terms of service is grounds for removal from their platform.  AWS has sole authority over the adjudication of such violations and they are under no obligation to inform the client as to the reason behind their decision.<p>If we want to limit the powers of these platforms, then Congress needs to pass laws limiting the scope of ToS and&#x2F;or create a regulatory agency charged with adjudicating claims.<p>There&#x27;s no analogs or moral arguments necessary.  Just the legal ones.  And Congress has failed to take any action to invoke legal authority over these platforms and their ToS.  Thus, the government has minimal control here.')
