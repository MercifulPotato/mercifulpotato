The intent (for years) is likely to avoid people striking it rich in startups&#x2F;movies&#x2F;etc, and then immediately leaving the state to avoid a tax on the windfall. The intent (for days) is probably to avoid a high net worth CEO &quot;moving&quot; to a close state and flying in frequently to conduct an in-state business. I don&#x27;t know many working people who spend 60 days&#x2F;year on vacation :-)<p>From the bill itself: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2088" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtml...</a><p>&quot;... percentage of days in the year such taxpayer was present&quot;<p>&quot;... the portion of a taxpayerâ€™s wealth subject to the tax imposed by this part shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be years of residence in California over the 10 last years, and the denominator of which shall be 10&quot;<p>So taking a contrived example of someone most affected who visited for the briefest of 60 day visits one time in 10 years, we would have 60&#x2F;365 * 1&#x2F;10 * 0.4% = .006%&#x2F;yr tax. That seems pretty reasonable for a CEO&#x2F;movie-star&#x2F;whatever who visits (most likely to earn more money based on in-state activities). Even over the ten year period this amounts to 0.06% which is TINY. For someone with $100M net worth, over ten years it would amount to $42K of state tax (note that the first $30M is not taxed).')
