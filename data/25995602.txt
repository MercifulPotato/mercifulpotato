Here are some tips:<p>1. Never take stimulants to have fun, just take them to do tasks to progress your life. ADHD doesn&#x27;t prevent you from having fun, and having fun with stimulants is what makes them addictive.<p>2. Take regular breaks from the medication. You wont get much done the first day or two after, so don&#x27;t plan on doing anything except stay at home and procrastinate those days since your inattentive symptoms will be worse than usual.<p>3. Sometimes try to do tasks without medication. Having worse focus helps in some way since it means you must master a topic much more before you can complete the task. My guess is that many of the PRO&#x27;s of ADHD comes from this, since it means instead of just completing a task and moving on you have been forced to master the subject way more than other people with similar grades&#x2F;achievements. Think of two people with similar grades, one worked hard and did lots of practice problems while the other was lazy and never worked. Who do you think understands things better? What do you think happens if the lazy guy suddenly puts in the effort? That is what happens with ADHD medication.')
