Around the time when I first figured out the algorithm, Betfair independently approached me about possibly working with them, and then banned me when I mentioned the algorithm. I’m not really sure whether it was the algorithm, or whether they just ban anyone who applies for a job. They wouldn’t give me any information.<p>I published this code while still thinking I was banned, and later found out that I wasn’t in fact banned anymore.<p>I’m currently looking for a job, and figure that I’ll get more money mentioning this as a project than I will make from creating an automated system. I’m still giving it a shot. As I said, I am quite sure that anyone making money has this algorithm as well. In that case, you’re competing on latency.<p>I am not completely sure though, as I cannot see all trades as they happen and compare them with my odds. I can only see a subset.<p>I will never know what the requirements of getting banned are. Maybe the API access for Hi Lo is just a front, and it’s just Betfair laying bets. I don’t see any incentive for them to allow others to lay a game for which exact odds can be computed.<p>Thanks for the tip on the link. There are actually two versions: standard and turbo. I will update.')
