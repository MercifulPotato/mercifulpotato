I urge you to (a) think about a long-term solution, and then (b) devote years of your life to making it a reality.<p>So a few ideas...<p>1) YouTube alternatives already exist (Libry, PeerTube, DTube, etc.)<p>2) It should be possible to clone as much content from YouTube as possible using the last version of YouTube-DL while it still works<p>3) We can migrate the content off a platform that wishes to make it impossible to share and remix work and put it on a decentralized model that does. Even better are platforms which allow you to download it directly without the need for hack tools.<p>I think the future is simply getting enough people to use the existing alternatives and contribute to them.')
