Before covid, were people still renting to sleep on the couch? For me, Airbnb was always this &quot;I don&#x27;t want a hotel room, I&#x27;d rather have an apartment by myself&quot;. I know some people would rent a room.. but the couch..?<p>I&#x27;m asking because I keep hearing that at first nobody thought that renting their couch was a good business idea, and how airbnb proved them wrong, yada yada. But IMHO, if right from the bat they explained how they&#x27;d be a full blown competitor to hotels because cheaper price and more convenient, I feel like the conversation would have been different with VCs.')
