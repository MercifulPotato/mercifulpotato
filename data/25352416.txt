Someone who just needs a watch that shows the time &amp; date and has a stopwatch can get a Casio which accurately does all this and has a battery that lasts years, in addition to an always-on display (note: for what it&#x27;s worth, the Apple Watch also has an always-on display).  From that perspective a Casio is vastly superior to both a Pebble and an Apple Watch ;-).')
