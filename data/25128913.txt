Many people who are moving back, at least in my anecdotal experience, are moving back closer to where they grew up. This might initial shift some of these areas a bit blue, but after 4, then 8 years people will return to a sense of regionalism, forget a bit how it feels to be in a hub filled with different experience and different view points.<p>Of course it is still possible that I&#x27;m completely wrong (I hope I am) and we&#x27;ll see this shift out of cities get more people with conflicting political viewpoints in the same room which might help reduce some extremism.<p>Or it could be both. The center continues right but we pull back some of the more extreme right wing views out there.')
