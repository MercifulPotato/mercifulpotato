The typical classical reality fundamentals.<p>Techno-utopianism was supposed to bring freedom to the world... instead it bought domination by the Big Tech, and realization that \nit all comes down to who holds the power. The classical reality fundamentals.<p>There are a few more cases.. it&#x27;s Faust all over again, that turns into kind of a half-scam along the way to attract VC money or your money, then culminates into a power grab.<p>&quot;The next revolution in X&quot;!, blah, blah.. blahblah.. blah.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re no better than believing in or living in a Harry Potter novel sometimes&quot; is more like his message - but it&#x27;s a fact that societies like to look at the least of all facts. After all, that might prevent the next high-yield psychotic mass scam from occurring.<p>I don&#x27;t know - I&#x27;m not a westerner, so perhaps it&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; for high IQ individuals to create or mis-use abstract mini-ideologies, mini-religions really, dress them as a New world, a Revolution really, to exploit individuals like workhorses over the span of many decades, until they realize that this was an illusion.<p>Btw we can&#x27;t spin it like &quot;Ooh, but if it wasn&#x27;t for this silliness, we wouldn&#x27;t have computers or the internet now&quot;. I disagree. You can&#x27;t know that. Perhaps the ideology wasn&#x27;t needed at all for technological development. Maybe it made for inspiration here and there, but that&#x27;s it.<p>So.. I don&#x27;t think that &quot;try again&quot; is his message at all. Watch more of his documentaries and it will become clear.')
