If you scroll down below the &quot;Choose your template&quot; section do you see a pricing section with purple background? I&#x27;m wondering if the scroll to logic is broken or if that section is just not being displayed. If you wouldn&#x27;t mind shooting an email to gabe.ragland@divjoy.com I&#x27;d love to follow-up about this.')
