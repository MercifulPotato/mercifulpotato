It can actually make things much much worse, particularly when there are already strongly held beliefs involved. All it does is further polarize an issue in peoples minds and make it more likely that they will hold faster to their beliefs. (i.e. the attacker reinforces the mistaken belief in the attacked&#x27;s mind and makes them even less likely to respond to a logical argument.) That&#x27;s how you turn loud voices into a dangerous situation and do it fast. (In other terms, that&#x27;s how you turn an argument&#x2F;discussion into a fight). This is true in pretty much every context.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-ten-golden-rules-of-argument&#x2F;#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20main%20ways,be%20considered%20above%20this%20one" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-ten-golden-rules-of-argument&#x2F;#:~...</a>.)')
