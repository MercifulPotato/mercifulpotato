The paradox states that every natural number is interesting. The &quot;proof&quot; is by contradiction: if there exists a non-empty set of uninteresting natural numbers, there would be a smallest uninteresting number â€“ but the smallest uninteresting number is itself interesting because it is the smallest uninteresting number, thus producing a contradiction.')
