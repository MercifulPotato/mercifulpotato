It&#x27;s funny you&#x27;re accusing me being a foreign agent, when your account is only 6 months old and only talks about politics here.<p>As far as I know the Biden residence was sold few years ago, and Hunter lives in LA, but could be wrong, it&#x27;s not possible to find definitive answer. But he has a house and his son was born in LA so high chance that&#x27;s where he lives.<p>I also have hard time to believe that someone who makes $80k a month would care about laptop repair, and even if he did, wouldn&#x27;t have someone on payroll (perhaps IT person from his company) who would go to his house to get it fixed.<p>Also, I still can&#x27;t see how a legally blind person (I know legally blind doesn&#x27;t mean completely blind) can do a water damage repair.<p>There are so many other holes in that story, but even if ALL of that was true, I don&#x27;t see how actions of a 50 year old man implicate his father. There isn&#x27;t any &quot;smoking gun&quot; in relation to Joe Biden. So what was the purpose of this story again?')
