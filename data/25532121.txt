No Adobe products in my life. Period. There are things that are logical with subscription plan, servers, cloud, collaboration functionality. Designing creative software with dark UX is Adobe business model. In the past their software was highly overpriced but you can have a lifespan of 3-4-5 years with updates. The reason that people are falling in Adobe Subscriptions trap was the notion that there is no alternative. But there is, Affinity, Capture One, Darktable - free, Raw Therapy- free, and more. I have invested in platform independent metadata workflow since Apple killed Aperture and left photographers in Adobe hell. Side note: One of the reasons people to shoot film is the focus on creative process without complicated software relationships. Can you imagine, if you are an artist and your brush &quot;must&quot; have subscription license and suddenly crashes without internet connection? This is the future according to software companies.
