A lot of simple geometric time to intersection problems (comes up a lot in game physics) don’t have known explicit solutions for example. Finding them is interesting but once you have something you can use an iterative algorithm on to find a solution at arbitrary precision the pressure&#x2F;incentive to solve them is reduced quite a lot.<p>Generally mathematicians would consider the number that answers this problem to be “known” in the colloquial sense, even before this better form.')
