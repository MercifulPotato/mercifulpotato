I linked the science around the subject. I have never seen anyone debunk these scientific theories.<p>&gt;. Just one example showing increasing temperatures with low solar activity <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realclimate.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;record" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realclimate.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;record</a>...<p>Your link is looking at 1960s and closer. My links are looking at the last 20,000 years. Solar activity dips are not measured in such a short period of time. The solar activity is in the &#x27;modern maximum&#x27; for the entire graph from 1960s on. You are not debunking anything with that link. It is of no surprise to me that during a &#x27;modern maximum&#x27; solar cycle that temperatures are going up.<p>&gt;Also arguments about temperature millions of years ago are not really meaningful, humans (and most other of the current species) did not live on earth at the time.<p>The 6 celcius increase in the last 20,000 to 10,000 years ago was something humans greatly benefitted from. The IPCC says that we are going to warm 1.4celcius by 2100. I&#x27;m 100% certain that humans can survive and very likely thrive because of this warming.<p>&gt;But at least the deniers have now as predicted progressed from &quot;it&#x27;s not happening&quot;, to &quot;it&#x27;s happening but it&#x27;s not that bad&quot;, soon we will be at &quot;it is definitely happening but it&#x27;s to late now to do anything so might as well do nothing&quot;<p>Are you asserting that I am a denier? I have never been a denier. No, my links literally prove climate change is real. My problem is that people like Al Gore who outright lied about Florida being under water right now. Miami should be completely destroyed right now according to Al Gore.<p>The problem I have is that people are exaggerating the risk of climate change for their personal gain. Al Gore has significant investment in that field.<p>My problem is that we have the Mayan Calendar doomsday people now jumping on climate change and saying it&#x27;s the end times if we dont do something within 10 years. Worse yet, that &#x27;something&#x27; is not in line with fixing the problem. It&#x27;s in line with their political ideology.')
