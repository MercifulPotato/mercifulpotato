I fell for their marketing and slick Apple-like design and decided to add a UDM-Pro router and access point to my pre-existing network.  I thought I was doing something wrong when the UDM-Pro ignored everything on my network that wasn&#x27;t connected directly to a Unifi device.  I asked about it on the Ubiquiti subreddit and basically got blackballed for &quot;whining&quot;.  Opened a support ticket with Ubiquiti and they confirmed that you can&#x27;t work with any clients on non-Unifi hardware.<p>So basically all you need to do is plug a laptop into a non-Unifi switch on someone&#x27;s Unifi network and are able to breach the firewall.<p>Needless to say I was flabbergasted at the vendor lock-in strategy worse than Apple, and asked for a refund.  Thankfully they complied.<p>I now have a hand-rolled OPNsense router that does everything I need, and with MUCH more configurability.')
