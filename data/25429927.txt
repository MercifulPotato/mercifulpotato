But seeing the majority out there does want to see ads or doesn&#x27;t care about seing them, it&#x27;s not like they won&#x27;t get paid at all.\nAnd indeed that majority won&#x27;t pay for content but there are others who do, and it&#x27;s not impossible to make a living out of it: there are proper independent online-only news channels out there with no ads and paid by their subscribers (plus a bunch of government subsidies usually).<p><i>just like a la carte TV, I think we&#x27;d find out that is much more expensive than we know.</i><p>Assuming you mean Netflix and the likes: that is actually way cheaper now than what &#x27;a la carte&#x27; used to be for me. 20 years ago when I wanted to choose what I looked at on a screen, I&#x27;d be looking at DVD rental because there wasn&#x27;t much of an alternative here. Or maybe even not an alternative at all, don&#x27;t remember exactly, but there was just cable TV and apart from standard channels you could get some extra (a porn channel, a sports channel), but that&#x27;s still not &#x27;a la carte&#x27;. Anyway: I easily paid twice what Netflix costs me now per month, every <i>week</i>.')
