Even that is kind of taboo - while studying before an interview is not, even if it will certainly have a much lower ROI.<p>Why not hack your appearance?<p>There are many scientific studies documenting all that, but we ignore them. For an example of all the known variables, check for ex table 1 of the following for &quot;Zero-order Pearson’s correlations between facial appearance and health, with the corresponding p-values and sample sizes&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5290736&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5290736&#x2F;</a><p>If you want more example for a given variable, for example the effect of adiposity (we know it&#x27;s quadratic), read one of the original papers:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6308207&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6308207&#x2F;</a><p>All this is well known now, as the first study was about 22 years ago:<p>Perrett, D. I., Lee, K. J., Penton-Voak, I., Rowland, D., Yoshikawa, S., Burt, D. M., … Akamatsu, S. (1998). Effects of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness. Nature, 394(6696), 884–887. doi:10.1038&#x2F;29772<p>So why do we keep ignoring it, while focusing on other signals like which search engine (or operating systen) you use?')
