We had democracy coming out of ears back then. Then Facebook came along and destroyed all that vast success humans have had with implementing and upholding fair democratic systems all over the world. It was utopia until 2007-2008 when Facebook went mainstream.<p>Wait, I got that all backwards. The world is more democratic today than it was in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or 1990s. Facebook is a recent convenient scapegoat for the same problems humanity has had with organizing fair systems of government for thousands of years, and it&#x27;s a particularly intellectually lazy scapegoat at that.')
