It is true that you do need quite a bit of capital in order to &#x27;start&#x27;. This is the reason why many big corporations like Blackstone have gotten into the game. In the UK, landlordism is a common way to &#x27;becoming a millionaire&#x27;.<p>After the &#x27;08 financial crash, the UK government even pledged to underwrite mortgages, making the game of starting a Monopoly-like property empire in the UK risk free for elites.

Securitisation allows big investors to borrow against the value of the properties, to buy more properties and pay off old debt, and acts as a loan that tenants pay back with their rent checks.<p>Wall Street is no stranger to the housing business in America. But their involvement as landlords of single-family homes is new, and so are the financial instruments they have developed.&quot;</i> [4]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;ng-interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;18&#x2F;revealed-sheikh-khalifas-5bn-london-property-empire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;ng-interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;artanddesign&#x2F;2019&#x2F;sep&#x2F;10&#x2F;push-film-review-leilani-farha-global-housing-crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;artanddesign&#x2F;2019&#x2F;sep&#x2F;10&#x2F;push-fi...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;single-family-landlords-wall-street&#x2F;582394&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;singl...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;wall-street-landlords-are-chasing-the-american-dream-heres-what-it-means-for-families-82146" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;wall-street-landlords-are-chasin...</a>')
