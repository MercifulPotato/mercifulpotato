Changing food around as it is shared and moves between cultures isn&#x27;t a uniquely American or even modern thing, it&#x27;s been happening for ages and a whole lot of traditional foods have been heavily influenced by other cultures.<p>Also super nitpicky but most folks in north america would incorporate the sauce in spaghetti and meatballs before serving, the whole sauce on top thing is mostly relegated to grandparents and betty crocker recipes - I&#x27;m sure a not small part of the reason for that is people rediscovering italian techniques though.')
