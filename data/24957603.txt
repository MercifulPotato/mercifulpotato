I especially like that it was done within vs code, which saves users from having to run yet another piece of software on their machines. This project should allow for a streamlined workflow for users.<p>A month or so ago I wanted to brush up on golang and decided to solve this same problem for myself. This lead to the creation of ancli, a CLI program that scrapes a notes directory and turns tagged notes into cards, using some of the same markdown syntax flash code uses.<p>My goal with this project is to support spaced repetition, but I got side tracked and the SM2 algo still needs some work.<p>Both ancli and flashcode seem to be solving the same problem in slightly different ways, so I wanted to share.<p>gitHub.com&#x2F;andscoop&#x2F;ancli')
