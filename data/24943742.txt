My mind has been completely hijacked for the past week as the election comes to a crescendo. My priority when consuming information is to get some idea of the known and unknown truths. Unfortunately, the current climate makes this difficult to ascertain in real time. There is an absolute onslaught of new info every hour (not just from the Bannon&#x2F;HB “drip” campaign, but also more general news), and nobody is objectively summarizing it.<p>The only choice is to immerse myself in this deluge of information and try to sort out the truth from propaganda myself. It’s infuriating that so few journalists are doing this for me.<p>I’ve never seen anything like this, on both sides. On the right, we have a carefully managed PR campaign that is, despite its agenda, appearing increasingly credible but also manipulating our attention. On the left, we have a unification of the media apparatus, the DNC and the FBI, actively suppressing information and misdirecting our attention.<p>I’m so glad Glenn Greenwald has staked out a position in this environment, because it really is an existential fight for truth. Now that Greenwald is on the case, I hope it forces the left and the Biden campaign to respond to this story. It’s not going away.')
