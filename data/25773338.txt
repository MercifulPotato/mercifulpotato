If you wanted, an old vt100&#x2F;vt220 or whatever other hardware serial terminal you like can be connected to a linux or other system and access a shell account with text browsers etc. In that scenario the terminal is &quot;accessing the internet&quot;. (Did this with a Televideo 970 in 2007 iirc for the ebay listing where we sold it)<p>If you want something to run an IP stack, then a 286 running `ka9qnos` is about as small as can do hardly anything useful, probably. There might be a c64 IP stack but at that point its getting technicality again; how much access and function counts?<p>If you&#x27;re looking for paranoid security in cheap hardware, 486 for absolute purists (runs linux handily, good luck with the graphics, matrox card ruled), and up to .. ppro? p3? or so if you&#x27;re slightly less pure.<p>Or get Sparc 5 or alpha or etc &quot;exotic&quot; hardware of that era and have an extra layer of obscurity <i>plus</i> years of unpatched security holes in any software you can make run today.')
