He literally spent decades of his later life trying to develop mainly Sherpa communities which lived in brutal poverty, largely left on their own by central government. Let&#x27;s not forget Nepal was and still is one of the poorest countries in the world. Very few benefit from tourism, and money Sherpa earn is brutal compared to rest of non-mountaineering population.<p>Basically you either join Gurkha and fight for British, go for mountaineering career, become a corrupt government official (which you can&#x27;t just join due to nepotism) or try to leave if you have money for it.<p>This &#x27;critique&#x27; goes both ways and kind of show its natural to humans - when both Tenzing and Hillary came back to India from Nepal (Nepal didn&#x27;t have an international airport back then, and it took quite a bit of time to built one, all expeditions went through India&#x27;s sea ports) - Hillary was almost completely ignored, and Tenzing was the only one to be celebrated.<p>I understand the motivations ie due to past shameful english colonialism, plus good old nationalism. But its like that everywhere. It doesn&#x27;t make it any more acceptable these days obviously.')
