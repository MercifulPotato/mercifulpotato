I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s fully documented yet, and if it is, that&#x27;s a relatively recent development.<p><i>And pro-rata&#x27;d subscription changes. And pro-rata&#x27;d refunds.</i><p>You can literally write the code to do things like this in a few minutes, including all conceivable edge cases. Many of us have. It&#x27;s basic arithmetic combined with some almost-but-not-quite-trivial logic around dates.<p><i>We pay Paddle 5% of every subscription transaction for a reason.</i><p>But Paddle&#x27;s model is a merchant-of-record, which also takes care of things like the tax reporting and remittance headaches that a service with Stripe&#x27;s model doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not a fair comparison.')
