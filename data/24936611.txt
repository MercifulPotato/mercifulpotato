The last 25 years have seen a trend of more open borders in and around Europe, but if the circumstances change, that trend can reverse itself.<p>And while such closed borders are more common in various dictatorships, given the political trends we&#x27;re seeing in many elections worldwide, it&#x27;s not particularly implausible that such policies could get majority support also in democratic countries if the economic conditions deteriorate, for example, because of climate change.')
