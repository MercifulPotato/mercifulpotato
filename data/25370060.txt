Growth in resource consumption and energy usage in the past 80 years tracked extremely closely to economic growth.<p>Combinatorial explosion in production possibilities does not mean anything close to combinatorial expansion in possibilities for growth. It&#x27;s an increase, but nowhere near factorial.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. Imagine that you are a barber shop. What advantage does 10 years of computing advances give you? You might be able to save 15 hours in accounting time and lower appointment friction by 20% over phone calls. The expansion in the productive possibilities linked to tech was combinatorial, but even in a period of ten years it barely improved your business.<p>The truth is that every frontier has a point of diminishing returns. Your point is that you believe that we can iterate on the value - resources front indefinitely. Well, empirical data just disagrees with you. We&#x27;re at 2% annual growth on average and slowing down, despite increases in consumption, and even less than that when correcting for population growth.<p>Yes, Malthiusianism is wrong. You can&#x27;t equate Malthiusianism with the belief that infinite growth is impossible, that&#x27;s just a total non-sequitur.<p>We might still see a lot of economic growth left in the future, but it&#x27;s clear there will be plateaus and it&#x27;s clear that we are nearing one.')
