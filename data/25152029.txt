This is compared to 957,390 games in the Apple Store.  That is a lot more to compete against to recoup development costs.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d be okay if Apple charged a nominal fee ($100) to do an initial review to add to the app store, another fee for updates ($50) and say 5-10% of margins on a sliding scale... that would hinder some indie dev, but not be outrageous and cover some of that review cost, while not squeezing everyone out like a cartel.')
