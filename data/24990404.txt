The current ones are hard even for veteran native programmers.<p>Next thing I&#x27;d love to see would be a simplified API to allow smaller developers to also use it. As it is, only giant companies can afford handling accessibility.<p>A personal wish would be to have an immediate mode imperative API for accessibility that abstracts the Automation Tree. Similar to how Dear ImGui does. Something like: BeginFrame, TextInput, Checkbox, EndFrame, etc... plus some commands to &quot;ask&quot; if the Automation API wants to do something, like moving to the next control. Maybe a Dear ImAccessibility?<p>This would work perfectly for Video Games and would allow accessibility to added even to games that didn&#x27;t predict it. Games are pretty simple, and don&#x27;t require too much variety. I worked in an Adventure Game in the past and it would be 100% playable using A11y with something like that. I would love to make a 100% accessible game in the future.<p>This of course could be a simple multi-platform wrapper instead of something from your team.')
