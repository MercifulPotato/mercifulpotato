The referendum was entirely a fault of the conservative government at the time, a gambit made not to appease potential UKIP voters but instead to satisfy in-fighting within the conservative party.<p>&gt;some even getting reasonable levels of parliamentary representation.<p>Your definition of &#x27;reasonable&#x27; differs from mine. Reasonable implies that the representation is fair&#x2F;proportional to the amount of votes received. In 2010, the results were as follows:<p>Conservatives: 36% of votes, 47% of seats.<p>Labour: 29% of votes, 39.7% of seats.<p>Liberal Democrats: 23% of votes, 8.8% of seats.<p>A &#x27;reasonable&#x27; level of representation for the 2010 election would&#x27;ve drastically reshaped British politics and the country would be much less divided than it is now. I feel strongly about this, since the UK used to be my home, but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to continue living there as a contributor to such a broken system.')
