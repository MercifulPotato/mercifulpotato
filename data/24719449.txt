But that&#x27;s why you have data marts that normalize the raw data into a standardized format. Ultimately though the raw data needs to remain the single source of truth. If you skip that step, and only store the post-normalized format, you&#x27;re likely to run into problems down the road. This could either be because you want to change the normalization format. Or you want to use some aspect of the data that isn&#x27;t captured in the normalized form. Or even you discover a pre-existing bug that affected all the previous post-ETL data.')
