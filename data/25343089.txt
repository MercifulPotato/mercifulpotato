My step dad worked night shift at AT&amp;T back in the 80’s and ran the 5ESS.  He took my brother and I in for a tour one night.  Thinking back on it now it was a <i>lean</i> crew for the equipment they were running.  Rows and rows and rows of equipment.  I don’t remember closed cabinets, mostly open frames moderately populated.  I’ll never forget he showed us some magnetic core memory that was still mounted up on a frame in the switch room.  Huuuge battery backup floor as well.<p>He loved all of that stuff, absolutely hated when everything went to computers.  Quit and became a maintenance man at a nursing home, commercial laundry repair guy then finally retired this year in his late 70’s (due to Covid) after working maintenance at a local jail.')
