Every modern high level language should provide these algorithms.\nI tried Swift and it has some nice features, but i in my opinion it&#x27;s not suited for system programming, because it has some very religious design desicions. For example:<p>- You can&#x27;t use a for loop to loop over array elements by reference.<p>- Just look how to work with pointers in swift. There is nothing more to say about it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raywenderlich.com&#x2F;7181017-unsafe-swift-using-pointers-and-interacting-with-c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raywenderlich.com&#x2F;7181017-unsafe-swift-using-poi...</a><p>A system programming language is a language in which you can write an memory allocator, or a function like dlopen().\nWhile you can possibly do this in Swift, it would be much easier even in C.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say swift is bad. The design desicions are ok for an application programming language.')
