Item(by='cheph', descendants=None, kids=[24662055, 24662240], score=None, time=1601641728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24661863, text='&gt; Are these features lacking?<p>Well, as I said I see them in flatseal so either flatseal is misleading or the features are there, and I have no reason to think flatseal is trying to deceive me so I assume they are there.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t need any of these to access anything outside a specific directory (or a small selection of such, but I don&#x27;t need them to access the full home dir, let alone the full root fs, even for reading).<p>Fire up flatseal and change the permissions to what you want it. I&#x27;m sure you can also petition for xdg-code directory or something and then keep all your code there and request the packages be changed to default only work under there but I suspect most people would not be so happy with this.<p>I am not sure how you expect the package maintainers to know where exactly on your FS you keep your code, I also don&#x27;t keep mine in my home directory.<p>And maybe a blacklist would make sense, but if all that is needed is a blacklist then I would harldy say that flatpak failed because it is not really that difficult to fix that deficiency.<p>EDIT: Actually blacklisting is supported, see --nofilesystem in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.flatpak.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;flatpak-command-reference.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.flatpak.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;flatpak-command-reference...</a><p>So really everything is there, maybe everything is not available in a nice neat UI, maybe the UX is not what it should be, but the core underlying system is not &quot;lacking&quot; these capabilities AFAICT.')
