Stop charging the car.  Keep is as an option, but make it something people only do at home with their solar power and leisure time.  Make the battery modules hot swappable.  Even better, make it so I can drive over a thing, the batteries swap while I am moving.  This means I stop owning batteries and as batteries improve, my car gets automatic upgrades.  I bet Elon can not only do this, but can probably even one-up this idea.')
