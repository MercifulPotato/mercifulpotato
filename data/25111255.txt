You have no idea what my life has been like and you have no place projecting your single anecdote onto others. I &quot;reconsidered&quot; once already and it was the biggest mistake of my life and wasted the past 10 years where I could have been making progress towards my goals.<p>If you convince even one person to give up on their identity because of this pettiness then you should know what an awful thing you&#x27;ve done.  I&#x27;m glad you put &quot;supportive&quot; in quotation marks, because based on how many times you&#x27;ve referred to your friend with male gendered pronouns (and other evidence) I doubt very much that you were actually supportive.  Sounds like a good thing that your friend has &quot;gone away&quot;, which I hope just means that she got far away from you.<p>Also it&#x27;s disgusting and ignorant for you to imply that childhood trauma causes people to become trans.  I was also abused as a kid and I&#x27;ve heard this argument too many times from people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.  Queer kids are targeted <i>because</i> they are queer.  Because of the shame society puts on being different, they are far less likely to report something.  Your causality is backwards.')
