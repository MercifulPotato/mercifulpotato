Today, more than 40 million people living in the U.S. were born in another country, accounting for about one-fifth of the worldâ€™s migrants.<p>&gt; The U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 44.8 million in 2018.<p>&gt; More than 1 million immigrants arrive in the U.S. each year.<p>What amazes me is how much hate the US gets for being one of the most generous countries on Earth.<p>The US has changed since the 19th century, when we needed endless amounts of unskilled labor. Things are much different today, and the H1-B Visa has been abused for decades.<p>&gt; The process of bringing in H-1Bs is already so expensive, arduous and wasteful that companies aren&#x27;t going to be bringing in huge quantities of &quot;US replacement&quot; labor. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t if I were in charge of hiring.<p>Good. It sounds like it&#x27;s <i>somewhat</i> serving it&#x27;s purpose. Hopefully these changes will improve it more.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;key-finding...</a>')
