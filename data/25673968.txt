Fox, CNN, MSNBC all do everything they can to coddle their specific segment. They phrase and comment on the news in a way that&#x27;ll either excite their segment when they think it&#x27;ll benefit and soften the blow whenever they think it&#x27;ll hurt.<p>And no, none of them appeal to a general audience. The ads that each network  displays will tell you exactly who their specific audience is.<p>Twitter&#x27;s audience is narrow: Most of the people I know (across countries, religions, genders, professions) do not have a Twitter account. So, they make decisions that suit their userbase, which is significantly narrower than Facebook&#x27;s.<p>Facebook user base is closer to the general public. Unfortunately, their platform also enables an echo chamber. So, they have a tough job to do and in this regard. They have to be careful about whom to censor. Whatever they choose will be closer the law. I think they&#x27;re trying their best.')
