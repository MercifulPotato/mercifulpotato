Even women would join in on this, in order to subjugate younger females to societal order. It can be explained to survive hard times and trials, but is also mostly about injustice and inequality for different traits.<p>Though the females are regarded as assets, they&#x27;re not allowed agency, freedom and inherent value. This is the history and hurt that is behind most of feminism of today, and there are still remnants in Western societies. Not because the laws and rules today are inherently discriminatory, but the cultural expression still inhibits life for half the population in many cases.<p>I&#x27;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader what this may mean for BLM.')
