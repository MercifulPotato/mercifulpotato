Learn to communicate.<p>To OP: If you think learning a programming language will make you a <i>better</i> English communicator you&#x27;re on the way wrong track.<p>If anyone is using jargon, I recommend that as a team you make it a point to avoid it. No one should be required to well-versed in anyone else&#x27;s jargon to collaborate on a job and it indicates they have some communication shortcomings as well. Work on it together.<p>Tech collaboration can be maze-like at first because I really think programmers are usually terrible at talking about our work to non-programmers. Avoid learning Java as a means to understanding someone else&#x27;s English.')
