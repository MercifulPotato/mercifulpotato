Sentences taken from websites we stumble across, like « We advance humanity » or « 125 years experience with the future », all on backgrounds of cute things which people pretend to be helping because they provide the software that helps build a machine for the doctor who helps a kid in Africa. Let’s be humble, as employees the company is here to provide us with experience and pay, and hopefully a good time; We must be mindful of the community we’re in and always talk to the old lady upstairs and lend our drill to the father who’s rebuilding his bathroom in the building; and the software we build has a nice role among the million other cogs that make society work. No go back to taking care of your families ;)')
