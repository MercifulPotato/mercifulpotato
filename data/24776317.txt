Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=[24776339], score=None, time=1602682385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775613, text='I&#x27;d call it &quot;moderation&quot; rather than &quot;censorship&quot;, but if you want to view the &quot;uncensored&quot; version of the site, you can click on your sign-in name in the top-right of the header, and you will be taken to your profile.  From there, set &quot;show-dead&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; to be able to view this and other flag-killed comments.<p>I and many others on the site prefer to view it in this form.  If you have show-dead on and some minimum number of HN points (30?) you can &quot;vouch&quot; to revive a killed comment.  I thought this particular example would have been better handled with a downvote-of-disagreement rather than a flag, so I vouched for it.  I can understand mettamage&#x27;s reaction, though, and don&#x27;t blame him for flagging it.')
