You can buy a hybrid hot water heater for around $1200 from your local hardware store. The crazy upside is it acts as an air-conditioner for your garage, and the heat exhaust is used to keep the tank of water warm. They&#x27;re loud, but it pays for itself in a few years.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised other homebuilders&#x2F;designers haven&#x27;t connected the a&#x2F;c condenser heat exhaust to a centralized location for hot water tanks. I&#x27;ve seen a few people on YouTube do it however for their heated pools.')
