We should all:\n- Wear a mask when even slightly ill\n- Stay home as much possible (even getting another person to pickup food) if you have symptoms\n- Get the flu shot<p>Stores, schools, etc. should also really think about circulation, hand sanitizer, and perhaps even nightly UV-C disinfectant.<p>Company culture needs to change: when sick, people should work from home for a job like programming and companies need give more sick leave for jobs like teaching where telecommuting doesn&#x27;t work as well. Businesses really need to think about their part to play in protecting their customers.<p>As a side note, my mother who is older wasn&#x27;t interested in the flu shot and I always wondered why. Even if it&#x27;s 60% effective, that&#x27;s just halving your chances of a sometimes fatal disease for $20 and a fifteen minute visit to a pharmacy. The US in particular needs to figure out how to do public health better.')
