Yes, close relationships and helping others in close proximity can feel good.  So can wealth, social status, or building a business that positively impacts millions of people.  It depends on your values, and your ability to align your actions with your values.<p>&gt; People like her and even the greatest in the field, like Steve Jobs, may lead extraordinary lives in our imaginations, but inside, they almost always feel horrible most of the time.<p>I believe you are actually the one romanticizing here.  Most people do not have this type of success, and therefore, tend to discredit the lives of those that do in order to protect their self-image.<p>The story of the outwardly successful CEO who is inwardly emotional distraught is a great Hollywood story, but it&#x27;s an exception.  If you actually follow the lives of most successful entrepreneurs, I think you will find that they are quite happy - enjoying their wealth and social status in their free time.<p>Yes, the day to day work of a CEO is very stressful.  But, when they have time to step back from it all, knowing that they gave it their all and made an impact can be deeply satisfying.<p>Again, the key is to not assume everyone shares the same values.  Family and friendships are one thing to value.  Impact, contribution, wealth, and social status are other values.  No value system is better or worse, objectively -- as long as you are capable of fulfilling your values.')
