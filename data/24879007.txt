The people behind the userspace of desktop Linux really really don&#x27;t though. If I want to write a Linux program that will work in 20 years without recompilation I can only depend on the kernel. Case in point:<p>&gt; download Debian potato (circa 2000) and expand to a directory on machine running the latest Linux 64 (potato is 32 bit only), chrooted into it, apt install whatever, and showed him it all just works.<p>You basically had to swap out the entire userspace to do that because ABI compatibility outside of the kernel is practically nonexistant.')
