Because looking at the breakdown, half the cost is in installation and presumably marketing and sales costs. Even if the panels themselves cost half as much, it would be a relatively small decrease in the total cost of the system.<p>I wonder what the practical bottom is - even if the panels were free, there&#x27;s a floor on the labor cost.')
