Yeah, great plan, I&#x27;m sure that will be helpful.<p>Citations are heavily biased towards papers that open questions, and against papers that answer questions. Compare the value of a paper that uses a new technique to answer one question to the value of a paper that uses established techniques to answer a thousand questions. The former will get many citations, but the latter is the one you&#x27;d want to read, most likely, if you wanted answers to questions.')
