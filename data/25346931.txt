At $159 and 2 years of aggressive usage (probably 3-4 hours every average day), I think they paid nicely for their price. That should average for around $0.06&#x2F;hour.<p>They&#x27;ll still end up in a landfill somewhere. The batteries aren&#x27;t replaceable, which makes them purely consumable with a 2-3 years lifespan at best (tiny ass batteries + heavy usage = multiple cycle a day).<p>Spending $549 on a battery powered gadget which will cycle several times a week and for which you can&#x27;t get a battery replacement is such a weird move to me. This is peak planned obsolescence, battery powered + non serviceable should be an instant red flag to anyone.<p>For comparison, my dt770 and shure se215 are going on their 6th years with no sign of ageing whatsoever.')
