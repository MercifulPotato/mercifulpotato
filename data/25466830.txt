Personally I like it better than other open world games that I played. It feels more immersive than most of them, as long as you don&#x27;t go out of your way to break the immersion. In GTA and Red Dead Redemption 2 it is far more fun to create havoc than to play any of the missions in Cyberpunk 2077 there is basically almost no point doing anything but the missions, but I still feel far more connected and invested in the character than in either of the two other games.')
