Why is the Matrix homepage so technical? API&#x27;s? HTTP Calls? What about staying in touch with my family? Contrast the two different opening statements (Matrix vs WhatsApp vs Messenger):<p>&gt; An open network for secure, decentralized communication [...] Matrix is an open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.<p>&gt; Simple. Secure. Reliable messaging. With WhatsApp, you&#x27;ll get fast, simple, secure messaging and calling for free, available on phones all over the world.<p>&gt; Hang out whenever, wherever. Messenger makes it easy and fun to stay close to your favourite people.<p>2. It&#x27;s not clear to me (a consumer) that in order to chat on Matrix I need Element, or that if I&#x27;m on Element I&#x27;m on Matrix. Or if I&#x27;m on Element my friends can have any matrix client, that might be called something else. So if I have Element and they have Nio that&#x27;s fine. But Kik and Nio isn&#x27;t.<p>These are just small details, but they would help a huge amount.')
