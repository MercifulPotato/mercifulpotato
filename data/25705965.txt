If you look at what is presented, you are given lots of claims, but very few facts.  Its just a load of evidence-free noise.  What&#x27;s to evaluate?!<p>Seriously, look a little deeper at almost any article.  There is no actual information there.  The question you should ask - critically - is how do I know this to be true?  And if you don&#x27;t know it to be true, why do you believe it to be true anyway?<p>UPDATE&#x2F;EDIT<p>And, in other conspiracy news, I am unable to reply to comments below.  &quot;You&#x27;re posting too fast. Please slow down. Thanks.&quot;  This will probably prevent me from replying for a few hours (last time it was 3 hours).  Understandably, people will think I&#x27;m flaky and unable to defend my position, where I am happy to have a meaningful interaction and share a different point of view.<p>Ask yourself, should I be able to say what I have said, in a free society?  Did you think HN wasn&#x27;t part of the problem?')
