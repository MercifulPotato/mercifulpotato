Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=[25653555], score=None, time=1609873012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649209, text='Yes, that my statement tells about some &quot;boss&quot; (CEO or VP of some company) who doesn&#x27;t want to be instructed by IT to slide the &quot;stupid&quot; (in their own opinion) cover and wants it to be automated, in the same way that they complain about the &quot;stupid&quot; (again in their own opinion) LED indicator light and wants it to turn off. It&#x27;s not totally about spying (surpringly some don&#x27;t have that concern at all) and more about that some people don&#x27;t see the point about the cover the same way that they don&#x27;t also see the point about the LED indicator and wants to have a &quot;fix&quot; (even though the fix is disingenuous to those who understands the reasoning behind it). Of course, Dell will lose their business with that company with that boss because the boss wants to have that fancy shutter and will switch if this condition was not met.<p>I don&#x27;t want to explain my sarcasm but I understand that some people may not get it and I apologise again for the inherent non-clarity of my first statement.')
