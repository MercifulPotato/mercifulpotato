I&#x27;d assume that most modern video chat solutions are adequate for sign language (but you know what they say about assumptions!). I&#x27;ve heard that reading lips over video is difficult. Is this a case where it&#x27;s possible to read maybe half of what people say, or is it just impossible to read anything?<p>What happens when a deaf person receives an unexpected call&#x2F;message when they&#x27;re not looking at their PC or handheld? Is vibration from a mobile device usually enough? Are there any visual systems for a desktop to signal the user at a distance? (I&#x27;m thinking of something like the flashing light alarm clocks.)<p>Is communication via sign language over video chat feasible with a mobile device? I honestly don&#x27;t know how much can be communicated with only one hand free. If one hand isn&#x27;t enough, is propping the device up on a stable surface enough to be able to communicate this way? (Common sense says that at this point everyone would just be texting, but sometimes you just need that human connection.)<p>I don&#x27;t have any practical need for any of these answers. It&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve been curious about for a while.')
