The rules are decided ahead of time etc..<p>With the &#x27;Dominion&#x27; system there is literally a paper record of each ballot - there were recounts that validated the electronic counts perfectly.<p>The &#x27;voting and ballot&#x27; part of the election is very secure, and there&#x27;s no way to systematically defeat it.<p>2) If there is an issue with the elections, it&#x27;s related to &#x27;who can vote&#x27;. States are in a constant war over this, the rules over &#x27;how to purge voter roles&#x27; (look into recent Georgia rulings). Those things, are today &#x27;grey areas&#x27; not well defined by anyone so it means conflict.<p>3) &quot;And it&#x27;s blatantly obvious that we don&#x27;t. &quot;<p>Just the opposite, it&#x27;s blatantly obvious that the elections are in fact secure - you&#x27;ve provided zero evidence to suggest otherwise.<p>But you&#x27;re missing the issue - the perception of election of integrity has <i>nothing to do with election integrity</i>.<p>This has <i>nothing to do with the facts</i>.<p>This has to do with <i>whatever Trump tells people</i> (i.e. Cargo Cult).<p>If Trump had won the election, there would be <i>zero concern over election integrity</i> because it&#x27;s entirely derided from his populist narrative.<p>The elections are as secure as they were in 2016 and 2012 - and there wasn&#x27;t some big uproar over &#x27;ballot counting&#x27; then, was there?<p>Why not?<p>Because &#x27;some populist figure&#x27; wasn&#x27;t screaming &#x27;Fraud&#x27; &#x27;Fraud&#x27; &#x27;Fraud&#x27;.<p>And even if the election were &#x27;mathematically secure&#x27; <i>it still would not matter</i>  because this has nothing to do with reality, it has to do with narrative.<p>A populist figure will say &#x27;The Election Was Stolen&#x27; - and his Cargo Cult followers will believe him, irrespective of the facts.')
