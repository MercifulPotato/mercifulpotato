The 10s of millions you don&#x27;t have to pay to registrar, you have to pay it the current owner of the domain, who like an owner of anything can dictate the price.<p>If that is correct, then how is &#x27;google one of the best things to happen to domain registrations&#x27;? I guess this is not refering to pricing, because 1k$&#x2F;a sounds like a lot of money for a domain.')
