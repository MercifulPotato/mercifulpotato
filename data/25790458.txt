Item(by='refurb', descendants=None, kids=[25795345], score=None, time=1610715833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789513, text='<i>&quot;MAGA insurrectionists&#x27; stated goal was to kill members of Congress and the Vice President, and overthrow the government&quot;</i><p>Ok, I assume you &quot;know&quot; this based on tweets and comments on parler.  But what did they do?  Bust some windows and force their way in.<p><i>&quot;The demonstrators in Portland had the goal of telling cops to stop murdering people,&quot;</i><p>Ok, but what <i>did they do</i>?  Flash lasers into cops eyes.  Shoot fireworks and throw molotov cocktails at federal buildings.  You claim &quot;white supremacists&quot; instigated this, but what proof do you have?  All I hear is rumor.<p>So let&#x27;s pause for a second.  We have Trump supports forcing their way into the capitol building.  And we have Antifa firebombing federal buildings.  But in your eyes the first are &quot;MAGA insurrectionists&quot; and the second is &quot;demonstrators in Portland had the goal of telling cops to stop murdering people&quot;.  Yet the second group is far more violent.  Why?<p>And nice dodge with the &quot;The capitol police, DC police, and national guard (under the direction of the DoD) deserve a ton of criticism&quot;.  You mention nothing about &quot;diffusing the energy&quot;.  Should they have done that?  Were the Trump protestors deserving of &quot;de-escalation&quot;?  It appears not.<p>If you judged each side the same way I&#x27;d have no problem (and I&#x27;m not saying each side is equal). Both sides are rioting and that&#x27;s wrong (even if you said Trump supporters were more violent).  Or if you said &quot;both side are protesting and some are getting out of hand&quot; (even if you said the Trump supporters were worse).  I&#x27;d have no problem.<p>But you&#x27;re not.  You&#x27;re giving Antifa&#x2F;BLM every benefit of the doubt (&quot;protestors&quot;) and assuming the worst about the Capital Rioters (&quot;insurrectionists&quot; and &quot;domestic terrorists&quot;).  For two groups whose activities are not that far apart, your judgement has them miles apart.')
