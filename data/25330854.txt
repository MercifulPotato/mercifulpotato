My question was centred around their financials because I still believe that the culture that Zappos famously practiced is impossible to imitate without dangerously compromising the company&#x27;s productivity. So I want to know did it work for Zappos either? Because I think it didn&#x27;t but I don&#x27;t have any data.<p>Disclaimer- Nothing against Tony Hsieh. I am sure he is a good person as I have rarely heard anything other than nice stuff about him.')
