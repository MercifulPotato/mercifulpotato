I&#x27;m sorry.<p>&gt; The arbitrariness...<p>I agree that clear notation is important; the pictorial style made me think of Feynman diagrams. My comment was a bit tongue-in-cheek, maybe unnecessarily so, but the point is that I fail to see how those pictures are clearer than plain text: you are not replacing complex stuff with a simple representation, you are just rewriting a simple formula in a different style.<p>&gt; Also there are issues with the lambda calculus notation...<p>Are there? That&#x27;s the same problem you face whenever you have dummy variables, e.g. the &#x27;dx&#x27; in integrals.')
