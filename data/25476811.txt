Item(by='TeMPOraL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608378183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475046, text='&quot;Post-scarcity&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean nothing ever is scarce - that&#x27;s impossible to achieve (simply because humans can invent new categories of things to want). &quot;Post-scarcity&quot; means all the things you need to survive, plus a good chunk of the things you&#x27;d reasonably want, are so cheap to make or in such abundance, that they become effectively free and unlimited. Thanks to fusion power and matter replicators, that is the case for humans in Star Trek universe.<p>The behavior of companies owning Star Trek IP stands in stark contrast with the values preached by the show. It&#x27;s not just fictional post-scarcity vs. real-life market economy; the IP owners are aggressively and self-destructively greedy (much like the Ferengi of Star Trek). It&#x27;s sad to watch, really - Star Trek has an extremely dedicated and creative fanbase that could be endlessly monetized if given a modicum of consideration. Instead, fan contributions are terminated with extreme prejudice.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m still sour about how they treated Stage9 - a fan recreation of the <i>entire Enterprise-D</i> in Unreal Engine. See [0], [1] for some visuals. CBS lawyers killed this, because of course they did. Would they lose money because of this project? Nope. Would they make money because of it? Sure, through renewed interest. They could&#x27;ve done a number of things, including officially subcontracting the developers and selling the work officially. But they didn&#x27;t, they killed it. And they&#x27;ll never produce anything that even comes close to this.<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bAM2dEEulBk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bAM2dEEulBk</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s8wpO8ONYm8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s8wpO8ONYm8</a>')
