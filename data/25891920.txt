The last time he has seen a local work as truck driver was in mid-2000 and meanwhile salaries have dropped to ~â‚¬700 and less therefore only some Eastern Europeans can justify that working as a driver still makes sense for them. There is not much wiggle room left in terms of just paying better salaries - even smaller freight-forwarders are asking themselves whether it continues to go there (at least for now).<p>Which is probably, in part, why Brexit happened. Think about it - this is a career that used to provide fairly well-paid jobs to British people, but EU rules around access to our trucking market meant that wages were driven down so much that the only people who can do that work are Eastern Europeans based in countries with much lower cost of living. And the response of the British elite, including our press, was to insist that this didn&#x27;t happen, that working class people were just brainwashed into blaming the EU because they were too stupid to realise it was their own damn fault they didn&#x27;t have jobs. There&#x27;s comments along those lines in almost every HN discussion of Brexit, including the other one that&#x27;s on the front page right now.')
