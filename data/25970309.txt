HTTP is done as a separate layer on top.<p>The benefits are: future protocol evolution (TCP is extremely difficult to change because of middleboxes, QUIC encrypts almost all of the header to stop middleboxes from messing things up) faster connection establishment (fewer RTTs thanks to bundling TCP+TLS handshakes), no head-of-line blocking when sending multiply streams over a single connection.')
