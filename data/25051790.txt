To use your example, the old hands are fully capable of being part of a discussion on the technicalities of a case with the student, they just realize there&#x27;s more to it than the technicalities. The conversation is at a lower level because the barrier for entry in experience is lower. Recognizing <i>who</i> someone is from the conversation they&#x27;re taking part in though is much harder. A historian or police officer could just as well understand that legal cases don&#x27;t depend as much on technicalities as people think and be capable of taking part in such a conversation without others in that conversation being able to tell the difference between them and a professional lawyer. The best bet then for most parties is to by default treat all others as equals of unknown origin until shown otherwise.')
