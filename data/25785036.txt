No doubt they&#x27;ll be citing this as evidence of their benevolent corporate mission in the next round of regulatory actions against the company.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.fb.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tag&#x2F;legal-action&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.fb.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tag&#x2F;legal-action&#x2F;</a><p>Users&#x27; data is Facebook&#x27;s main asset.  They created the danger posed by these defendants by intentionally collecting user data on such a massive scale.  They&#x27;re not protecting users, they are protecting their business of creating pools of similarly situated users for advertisers to target.  Facebook will never protect users from advertisers.  They will not sue their own customers.<p>At least with these defendants one can get a rough idea of what they were trying to do, the methods they were using to collect data.  With Facebook, the internal operations of the company, how they solicit, collect and use people&#x27;s data, is deliberately withheld from public scrutiny.  &quot;We&#x27;re using your data to make our service better.&quot;  For whom?  Their customers, which may include political campaigns.  Facebook is free.  The user is not the customer.  &quot;We cannot reveal what we are doing because that would put us at a competitive disadvantage.&quot;   Obviously they are doing much more than just storing your data and making it available to your friends list.  You are not the customer.')
