That will shift the market for domestic and commercial.<p>2) Self-driving safety stats - this is going to become huge when there are self driving choices.<p>If one company can say &#x27;we are half as likely to have an accident&#x27; type marketing, this is going to become a new and significant factor in vehicle purchase, more so than safety rating are today (I believe anyway) as we are taking out the &#x27;Im in control of my experience&#x27; factor.<p>3) Self driving will flow to other innovation. Cars will no-longer need to be 4 seats facing forward. Huge opportunity to re-think transport once you dont need a driver seat.')
