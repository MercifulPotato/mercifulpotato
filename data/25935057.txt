Rather, if one hack week style prototype doesn’t work on the first try, it’s chalked up to “over hyped AI” and never sees the light of day. Organizations that succeed with ML don’t do it that way. Instead they ensure the success criteria are stated up front and measured throughout, so you can see <i>why</i> it didn’t work and iterate for v2 and v3. “We spent a bunch of R&amp;D expense on magic bullet v0 and it didn’t succeed immediately” is a leadership and culture problem - you probably can’t succeed with ML until you fix that.<p>2. Many companies have no idea how to staff and support ML teams, and go through various cycles of either taking statistical researchers and bogging them down with devops or taking pure backend engineers and letting them do unprofessional hackery with no clarifying product quality ML expert in the loop.<p>You need a foundation of ML operations &#x2F; infra support that cleanly separates the responsibilities of devops away from the responsibilities of model research, and you must invest in clear data platform tools that facilitate getting data to these teams.<p>If an org just figures they can throw an ML team sink or swim into an existing devops environment or they can require an ML team to sort out their own data access, it’s setting ML up for disaster - and again you’ll get a lot of cynics rushing to say it’s failing because ML is just hype, when actually it’s failing due to poor leadership, poor team structure and poor resourcing.')
