Because of higher priority issues the maintainers do not yet work on it. The issues becomes stale and now the maintainers will <i>never</i> work on it unless you always prevent stall or reopen a new issue.<p>And sometimes there are issues which can not be resolved but still are issues (e.g. (for now) unsolvable bug) IMHO such issue should stay open even if there will not be any work&#x2F;improvement on them for maybe years.')
