They&#x27;re not doing the selling, the merchant is. Shopify sells software, not things.<p>Well, then you&#x27;re simply wrong, Shopify should have the right to not do this business with another company if they chose to. Again, I&#x27;d like to point you towards for instance Stripe who also isn&#x27;t &quot;doing the selling&quot; yet will stop working with you if the product you(the merchant) are selling isn&#x27;t liked by their backing bank \n- and that happens all the time with things that I mentioned, despite them being legal . They cannot be forced to work with you nor should they be.<p>&gt;&gt;Toyota doesn&#x27;t refuse to sell me cars because they don&#x27;t like where I might drive.<p>Toyota won&#x27;t because it would make a poor business decision, but Ferrari absolutely won&#x27;t sell you a car if you want to repaint it and use for messing around. They famously refuse to sell their cars to YouTubers and celebrities who they don&#x27;t want associated with their brand. What, do you think they should be forced to? How would that even look like? A court order where Ferrari has to sell you a car under threat of penalties? Does that not sound insane to you?<p>&gt;&gt;HP doesn&#x27;t refuse to sell me laptops because they don&#x27;t like what I might write on it.<p>No, because again, that doesn&#x27;t make good business sense. But for instance apple will refuse to sell their laptops to be used in productions they don&#x27;t want to be associated with. Nvidia won&#x27;t sell you their GeForce cards if you&#x27;re an academic institution or research institution(because they would rather sell you quattro cards). Again, how will you force them to again?<p>I mean, we can keep going on like this for a while if you&#x27;d like.<p>&gt;&gt;Shopify&#x27;s actions are just as ludicrous as the two I just mentioned above.<p>So, not ludicrous at all then, we&#x27;re in agreement then.<p>Look, you&#x27;re being completely unreasonable to prove a point that is ultimately just wrong.')
