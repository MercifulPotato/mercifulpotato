Item(by='ljf', descendants=None, kids=[24973206], score=None, time=1604349189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972194, text='I&#x27;m putting the kids to bed so don&#x27;t have time to dig out any figures of interest, but my wife caught covid back in March, was OK but pretty ill, but then moved into the long covid phase and was wiped out. Heart rate all over the place and terrible numbness and loads of other rubbish. A full body scan showed issues with her heart function back in August, which is only just starting to recover now, a &#x27;low ejection fraction&#x27; and other bits I forget. Latest scans show improved function but nothing like she should see at her age or fitness. This time last year she was lifting 47kg in the gym and working out 4 days a week.<p>The long term studies showing what you are asking are only just starting to show results - but everything we see so far shows that this is causing more issues, in more people than flu.<p>Also of note, a partner of my wife&#x27;s friend got covid (positive test) back in April with only light symptoms. Just got it again (tested again) and is very ill this time - had to go to hospital but wasn&#x27;t kept in. So immunity might not be what we think.')
