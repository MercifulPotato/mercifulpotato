The access is free through the 14 days trial, and you can play around with various settings and check the responses that GPT-3 suggests. The link above provides some basic context like integration settings and how to use it, and you can find a sign-up button for the tool itself under the first paragraph of text.<p>To extend the trial after initial 2 weeks (or if you already have Activechat account with expired trial), you can use this 1-month 100% discount coupon: “gpt3test”. Don’t forget to cancel your subscription after 1 month to avoid being billed if you don’t plan to use the tool for production purposes.<p>I’d be happy to hear your thoughts about the integration, particularly your opinion about the value it has for live chat agents.<p>Thanks!\nAndrew')
