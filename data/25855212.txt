Surely it would be absolutely trivial to hire someone so that the vast, vast, majority of people with guns wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to you, no matter how hard they tried, even _with_ so-called inclination and skills?<p>I&#x27;m not even referring to having guard detail around them all the time; when you&#x27;re that important and hundreds of billions of market cap depends on your very existence, their entire schedules will be mapped down to the smallest detail to minimize risk of harm to them, since if they were to get kidnapped, it would immediately wipe billions off the stock price. Do you really think that the only reason Bezos hasn&#x27;t been captured is because ordinary people with guns just chose not to do so, and if anyone wanted, they could just kidnap Bezos easily? What percent of ordinary people like you or I have &quot;skills&quot; and &quot;inclination&quot; that can beat that hired by Bezos&#x27; billions?')
