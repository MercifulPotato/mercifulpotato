I&#x27;d be more dramatic - advertising like this risks Substack&#x27;s brand reputation, and the subscription incomes of every non-advertising publisher on it; in other words, the existence of the business itself. If I&#x27;m paying to get ad-free content, and ads slip in anyways - I&#x27;m liable to blame Substack.')
