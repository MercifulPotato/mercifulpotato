I made my MSc thesis about data visualization and the thing I found useful was excess entropy, which means how well you can you predict the next bit better, if you take one bit more into the sliding window you use to predict the next bit&#x2F;byte. That is usually really dependent about the sliding window size. Imagine what happens with text written in 8 bit characters. With that trick one could make a 3d visualization.')
