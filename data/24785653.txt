Or perhaps I was my fault for not being clear. My policy was referring specifically to discussing politics within the workplace.<p>As for your question, everyone is of course allowed to ask for more pay. This is not what I&#x27;d call politics, but simply salary negotiation. If you&#x27;re suggesting something different. Then yes, you generally aren&#x27;t going to help yourself within an organization by calling your boss a sexist who needs to promise to stop being a sexist. Or whatever it is you&#x27;re specifically proposing.')
