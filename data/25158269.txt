An older version was available at no cost, the newest version cost money. Both were MIT licensed.<p>If you were a company, and wanted to pay me, it was easy - send me a PO and you would get the source code to the newer, faster, more capable version.<p>Nothing in that looks like a donation.<p>I did it this way precisely because giving someone money for being &quot;super nice&quot; and distributing no-cost FOSS software DOES NOT FIT with the accounting mechanisms of most companies.<p>Even with this, I was at one pro-FOSS workshop. One of the presenters described how they used my no-cost version and how great it was. (Did I know they used the software? Not until that day.) I pointed out that many FOSS projects are underfunded. Their response was that it was so hard to get their company to fund FOSS projects (along lines that cageface observed).<p>I pointed out that it&#x27;s really easy to pay for my project.<p>They still never bought a copy or support contract.<p>I came out of that workshop convinced that the primary reason companies like FOSS is because it&#x27;s generally available at no cost. Not because it reduces long-term dependencies on external parties, not because it improves software development methodologies, and not because it&#x27;s an essential liberty. But simply because of the cost.')
