In practice that meant that if you were selling to UK (or other EU country) from outside customs union, you&#x27;d send your shipment as usual and only attach declaration of contents, and the buyer (importer) would pay VAT and necessary customs fees if applicable.<p>The new regime apparently requires the seller to setup VAT registration in UK, properly process VAT on their side, then transfer it to HMRC (UK tax agency).<p>This is a <i>HUGE</i> difference and big burden to both exporters and importers. Yes, importers now don&#x27;t need to handle VAT - but they are still on the hook for customs fees, and now they have to worry not just about &quot;did the other side file customs declaration right&quot;, something moderately easy to fix when it goes bad, but have to deal with &quot;we can&#x27;t import unless the seller effectively set ups half a company in UK&quot;')
