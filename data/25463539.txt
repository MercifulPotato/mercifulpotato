Problem is, many had significant capital gains. I ended up just taking a margin loan for a blended rate of about 1%. I avoided capital gains, the margin interest is deductible, and my tech heavy portfolio has increased substantially in absolute terms and on a percentage return basis is crushing it.<p>I was comfortable with margin&#x2F;leverage, for a few years I was very successful with a strategy of buying blue chip dividend stocks on margin and essentially running a credit spread trade- it&#x27;s not for everyone.<p>But IB is outstanding compared to other brokers around things like this- it really excel for the &quot;prosumer&quot; niche.')
