They and their staffers do listen and their votes directly determine the funding and oversight for NSF, NASA, and DOE.<p>I don&#x27;t have great advice for direct advocacy (A billboard that says, &quot;America&#x27;s scientific infrastructure is collapsing -- fund science now!&quot;?). At the grassroots level, providing opportunities for people to engage directly with science -- outreach, lab tours, science field trips, etc. help people to learn to understand the world around them, engage with science, see the infrastructure, and take ownership.<p>Every time I have given a lab tour, I thank everyone who attends for underwriting the science with their tax dollars.   Essentially all fundamental research in the US is funded by you, the taxpayer. We are really, really grateful for the opportunity to learn something new about nature and share it with everyone. Thank you.')
