On Stadia, you have  to buy the games separately on top of the streaming subscription, and Luna (Amazon&#x27;s offering) is similar in that you can sign up for game &quot;channels&quot; (iirc). With GeForce Now, you can just play the stuff you already own without sinking money into games that play on a platform that might not even exist in a few years. I bet in another year or so Stadia will shut down and all those games that you paid for on the platform will disappear.')
