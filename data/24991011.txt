Thus I got verbally &amp; physically bullied at school badly too.<p>Until I was about 10-11, at which point I decided I had enough and snapped with all the pent-up rage of someone with nothing left to lose. I began starting a fight the moment others would belittle me. Didn&#x27;t always win, but eventually other kids decided being a dick wasn&#x27;t worth the physical confrontation and learned to leave me well enough alone.<p>Reflecting on this as an adult, I think that living through violence and abuse typically ends in one of two ways for most people.<p>Either they normalize the behavior, and perpetuate the cycle against their spouses and own children, or having lived through it themselves they can&#x27;t imagine ever doing something like that to another human, let alone someone they care about.<p>I fall firmly into the second camp, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the rule.')
