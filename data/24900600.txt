Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[24903168], score=None, time=1603742234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896087, text='&gt; The idea that elite schools are purposely excluding Asians is absurd on its face. The people pushing the idea have an axe to grind and it usually isnâ€™t actually in the interest of Asian-Americans.<p>My high school was 70% Asian. Projections are that getting rid of the entrance exam will drop it to about 30% Asian. (Ironically, the group that will benefit the most from the lottery is white people.) The elite schools are capping the percentage of Asians--you can see this by comparing against schools that don&#x27;t practice holistic admissions.<p>Affirmative action and lottery-based admissions in particular is, in at least a narrow and direct sense, contrary to &quot;the interest of Asian-Americans&quot; just as its contrary to the interests of white Americans. Standardized testing offers a direct path to the middle and upper middle class for Asian immigrants (as well as other immigrant groups such as Nigerians who come to the U.S. with lots of education but not necessarily money). Asians have extremely high levels of income mobility in the U.S.--an kid growing up in the bottom 20% has a 27% chance of ending up in the top 20%; double the odds for a white kid born in the bottom 20%. My dad was born in a village in Bangladesh. Thanks to the SAT, my brother and I are comfortably in the top 1%. The U.S. system of &quot;meritocracy&quot; (such as it is) is extremely effective at helping us distinguish ourselves from upper middle class white people who have more cultural competency, social connections, etc.<p>In &quot;How to be an Anti-Racist,&quot; Ibram X. Kendi defines &quot;equity&quot; as the representation of a group in an organization reflecting the representation of the group in the general population. Any other distribution, he declares, is the product of systemic racism. I don&#x27;t think Kendi was thinking about the implications of that statement for non-white, non-Black people, but they are alarming for Asians, Jews, Nigerians, etc. Imagine cutting Harvard down from 20% Asian to 5-6% Asian. Or Google or Facebook! What do you think that would do to Asian income mobility?<p>Now, I happen to support measures to reduce disparities for ADOS people, because all Americans have a common obligation to remediate the nation&#x27;s history of slavery and segregation. To that end, I support things like traditional affirmative action.<p>At the same time, Asians are a minority and have to be realistic about the fact that they are not similarly-situated to either white people or Black people and do not have identical interests to either group. Holistic measures that limit the Asians at elite educational institutions and businesses to 20-25% may be tolerable. Measures like lotteries that would reduce Asian representation down to 5-6% would be a dramatic negative change.')
