Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603742234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896087, text='&gt; The idea that elite schools are purposely excluding Asians is absurd on its face. The people pushing the idea have an axe to grind and it usually isnâ€™t actually in the interest of Asian-Americans.<p>My high school was 70% Asian. Projections are that getting rid of the entrance exam will drop it to about 30% Asian. (Ironically, the group that will benefit the most from the lottery is white people.) The elite schools are capping the percentage of Asians--you can see this by comparing against schools that don&#x27;t practice holistic admissions.<p>Affirmative action and lottery-based admissions is, in at least a narrow and direct sense, contrary to &quot;the interest of Asian-Americans&quot; just as its contrary to the interests of white Americans. Standardized testing offers a direct path to the middle and upper middle class for Asian immigrants (as well as other immigrant groups such as Nigerians who come to the U.S. with lots of education but not necessarily money). Asians have extremely high levels of income mobility in the U.S.--an kid growing up in the bottom 20% has a 27% chance of ending up in the top 20%; double the odds for a white kid born in the bottom 20%. My dad was born in a village in Bangladesh. Thanks to the SAT, my brother and I are comfortably in the top 1%. The U.S. system of &quot;meritocracy&quot; (such as it is) is extremely effective at helping us distinguish ourselves from upper middle class white people who have more cultural competency, social connections, etc. Ibram X. Kendi&#x27;s proposal for &quot;equity&quot;--which would see groups represented in proportion to their numbers in the general population, would significantly reduce income mobility for Asians. (Imagine cutting Google or Facebook down to 5-6% Asians.)<p>That said, I happen to support affirmative action measures for ADOS people, in recognition of the unique challenges and persistent income and wealth gaps faced by members of that group. (Note that this is itself a minority position in the United States, where majorities of whites, Black people, and Hispanic people believe that race should not be a factor at all in college admissions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;most-americans-say-colleges-should-not-consider-race-or-ethnicity-in-admissions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;most-americ...</a>.)<p>Where I get off the train, however, is gaslighting about what is &quot;actually in the interest of Asian-Americans.&quot; You&#x27;re asking Asians to vote to change policies that have been extremely favorable to them. Maybe they should do that, but it&#x27;s not in their immediate, direct interest.')
