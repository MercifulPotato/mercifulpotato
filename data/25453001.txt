Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608184587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452325, text='&gt; Even the economics of dedicating a large, empty space for VR means it&#x27;s mostly for &quot;rich&quot; people. You could be middle class in the &#x27;burbs and pull the car out of the garage to do VR... But what if you live in a tiny SF or NYC apartment? What about even denser living conditions outside of the US?<p>I get the complaints, and VR isn&#x27;t really something that suits me as I get nausea really quick with headsets messing up my hearing somehow. I had this same effect when I took the train and had to face backwards to the direction the train was heading. It&#x27;s really unpleasant and losses all novelty in about 10 minutes.<p>But, I have to ask: with the advent (or promise really) of 5G why wouldn&#x27;t you take to being outdoors for a session of <i>alien blasters VR</i> instead of being suck inside? One of the cool things I think AR has over VR is that we saw how the Pokemon game fad got people who spend way too much time on their phones to go back outside with the right incentive (and putting aside the massive privacy intrusion it turned out to be) and being able to interact with their environment as part of the game quest. I can&#x27;t see why a designated area in the park couldn&#x27;t be allotted for that, and it would be cool as you could share it with younger kids who may not be able to afford or have access to the unit to ever try it and ultimately build community with other enthusiasts.<p>I saw that happen with some of the local kids with drones at my community park this year after seeing little to no kids the year earlier ever playing there. By the end of summer it looked they were all making videos or something together.<p>This is one of the cooler unintentional things that happened   I was learning to fish out at the pier; the looks on some kids faces when something &#x27;feels like a bite&#x27; is hilarious, and its pretty much Christmas if they ever catch anything even if its just bait fish.<p>There are Bitcoin meetups in VR happening right now, but to be honest I&#x27;d rather just go to the conference calls one where you can see a stream along with the attendees faces. Anything else seems off putting, but then I don&#x27;t really get the appeal of something like second-life interactions with avatars.<p>I was re-watching season 3 of the Expanse, and that ship building puzzle in the train station on Mars with all of those kids assembling it looked like a really cool thing to have if we could work out the tech. Hacking culture can&#x27;t be introduced early enough in my opinion.')
