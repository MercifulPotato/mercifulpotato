But large, complex projects, in my experience, inevitably develop strange and unusual build needs. At that point, if your tool doesn&#x27;t support them naturally, the complexity ends up going somewhere else - you have to write plugins, or standalone tools, or build script generators, or manage a lot of repetition in the build script, or multiply subprojects, etc, so you can do what you need to do.')
