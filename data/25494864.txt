The original lockdown furloughed a LOT of workers, closed schools and closed virtually all shops. Today&#x27;s &quot;super tier 4+ lockdown&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to apply to shops at all (my local shops were all open this morning, is wrapping paper really an &quot;essential&quot;?). Workers are mostly going in. Schools that have remained open unless they already closed and childcare is still running.<p>They&#x27;ve basically just shut restaurants. That&#x27;s the only change I can see...<p>I&#x27;ve posted elsewhere that my cynical view of the UK gov approach is that they are talking tough and doing nothing. So maybe I&#x27;m biased?<p>Perhaps a move transmissible strain will force real action?')
