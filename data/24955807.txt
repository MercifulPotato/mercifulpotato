And this car will still be in use 20 years later with no restrictions on its features except wear.<p>While a Tesla is manufactured in a brand new factory with no previous precedence of parts or processes.<p>And on top of that, it&#x27;s re-sale usability is apparently garbage. So we&#x27;ll see a bunch of old Teslas litter nature because no one wants them.')
