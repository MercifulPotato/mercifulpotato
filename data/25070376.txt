The gender distribution of applicants stays about the same, but the gender distribution for hires has dropped for men and risen for women. So were the women previously dropping out of the workforce? Do we now have men dropping out of the workforce? Or are they simply being reshuffled among the various companies within the industry? I ask this because there are other studies that say the industry in the US is facing a shortage of tech workers, so it seems unlikely to be that a significant number of people would be dropping out, or that this study accurately represents the industry as a whole.')
