Note people&#x27;s birthdays? Sure, you only want to target companies. Make sure you choose your acquaintances wisely, I guess, or make sure you record their grant of permission to email them, because people abuse laws like this to harass each other every single day.<p>- This also punishes possession, not use. If you think about that for a minute, it should become clear both how this doesn&#x27;t attack the right problem, and how companies would evade it.<p>- Finally... how are you going to audit Ford or Geico? Honest question. Who pays for the audit of &quot;every piece of unattested PII on every individual&quot;? How often, what is the dispute mechanism, and who administers that? Seriously - this sounds like a job for a new agency combining significant portions of the IRS, the FBI and PwC.')
