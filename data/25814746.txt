If people cannot run your software freely, for any purpose, then it is not free software (and that includes users who are big companies).  There&#x27;s really no way around that.  If you are worried that companies may use your software without giving back to the community, the best is to use a copyleft license like GPL or AGPL.  You can also dual-license your software as AGPL&#x2F;proprietary, and sell proprietary licenses at different prices according to the client.  This is a fairly common setup, and many companies appreciate it (the only issue is that all external contributors to your project must surrender their copyright to you).')
