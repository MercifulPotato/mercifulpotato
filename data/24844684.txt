They also wrote them in C so they would be more portable. Their aims were similar for both - similar accuracy and performance.<p>The C versions were usually slower - sometimes a <i>lot</i> slower. They knew all the optimizations the compiler was doing and tweaked as much as they could.<p>In general, though, you&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m particularly annoyed at universities that insist on making their students do <i>all</i> their microcontroller labs in assembly. When I took the course, the professor made us do only two assignments in assembly, and the rest in C. He said it had been over a decade since he had encountered a real world microcontroller problem where one needed the assembly - and he said this some decades ago.<p>I don&#x27;t do microcontroller stuff for a living, but anecdotally, the only people I&#x27;ve met who insist one must program in assembly for microcontroller problems do <i>not</i> do it for a living.')
