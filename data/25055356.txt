Sold my old farmhouse near downtown San Jose (12th St), and bought a farm in Iowa with the proceeds. Never looked back.<p>And never could have gone back. After getting off the land-price escalator, there was soon nothing I could hope to buy at anything like what I sold for.<p>Anyway I never wanted to. I raised a family here on 80 acres of land in a new 2300 sq ft house I built in a cornfield, 15 minutes from a university town. Boys grew up hiking, biking, doing projects in the shop. Taking lessons from PhDs and doctors. Metalworking classes from Amish blacksmiths. Music lessons from well known performers and teachers.<p>There&#x27;s a whole world of interesting places and landscapes out there. Plenty of towns large enough to support whatever interests and entertainments you want. And all at a fraction of the cost, fiscal and emotional.')
