Think sweatshops and prostitution, when promised to work in a high-end resort. It’s extremely easy to take advantage of people when they are out of their home country. \nBy regulating the industry it keeps bad actors out, but I’d think it’d be very unlikely to improve the recruitment process quality; the common knowledge is that less regulation leads to... well whatever <i>those</i> people are selling these days.')
