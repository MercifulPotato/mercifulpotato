Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606374839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25215974, text='&gt; Are you arguing that only a $700B&#x2F;yr organization can train people to do the simple tasks that a soldier learns to do?<p>Not only train the soldier: but also to check on their progress, ensure they are following the proper military culture, growing into their role, and promoting those who are worthy.<p>The entire life of a soldier is well defined thanks to the work of the generals and leaders of the military. Group organization and cohesion is no accident: its a purposefully built goal. And yes, money has a lot to do with it.<p>Propaganda and recruitment is a big one: there are literally soldiers going out into the country, and individually recruiting kids out of high school to become a soldier. This increases the talent pool, and effectively lowers the wages you need to offer soldiers (supply and demand after all).<p>No one is going out there recruiting people into nursing fields.<p>&gt; So now we&#x27;re in agreement. The sky is not falling, and Tulsa may have a local logistical challenge. Nothing to see here.<p>And a record death rate. Are you trying to imply that COVID19 deaths aren&#x27;t happening or something?<p>Deaths skyrocket with caseload. Yes, there are treatments that help prevent death, but only if the nurses &#x2F; doctors have enough time to do their job. If they become overwhelmed, then their ability to process life-saving treatment is mitigated.')
