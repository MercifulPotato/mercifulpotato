While remote socialization during the pandemic has been far from ideal, I think our last year&#x27;s experience collectively has proven that socializing digitally is somewhat possible and might prevent (or at least mitigate) the worst effects of isolation.<p>If there are any physicists&#x2F;engineers reading this that have the appropriate expertise to potentially work on something like it, I&#x27;d be super curious to hear your thoughts about how it could work.<p>Assuming we&#x27;re supporting a Moon colony of nontrivial scale (~100 people maybe?), what would the experience of connecting to Earth&#x27;s internet be like for the colonists? What infrastructure would we need to create to make it possible and&#x2F;or improve it?')
