But indeed, it shines when you use it within Emacs because you can extend it. Even the &#x27;vanilla&#x27; setup is very powerful -- you get the markup, datetimes, todos, scheduling, agenda, clocking, literate programming, etc.<p>Spreadsheets.. personally, never had the need to use formulas, but they are very nice when you need.. well, to organize information in tables. For example, I&#x27;m using it with org-capture to track sleep data straight into the table, which results in a table row for each day (with an auto-generated timestamp).')
