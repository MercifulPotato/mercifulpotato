It may turn out to be completely wrong. It does not warrant &#x27;a lot of investigation&#x27;.  There are so many spurious results out there, it would be a fools errand to dig into every curious result.<p>And no I did not mean some correction. I meant, that publishing is a filter for any seemingly correlated result. It will inevitably include simple coincidences, because of the sample sizes involved.<p>To put it simply, <i>all coincidental results</i> end up being published, because they look so remarkable. It&#x27;s a reason to be very skeptical of small samples.')
