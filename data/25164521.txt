One of founding members of Sorbet(though I no longer work on it anymore).<p>Story that Ufuk shares is common.<p>We saw this process repeat in many companies, Stripe, Shopify and many others - folks are initially bothered with verbosity of `sig` syntax, but as the company starts using it in practice stop being bothered pretty quikcly. It happens even faster now that IDE integration allows to auto-complete entire signature and can in most cases correctly guess the types of arguments &amp; result type. You rarely type `sig`s yourself.<p>The common internal asks at Stripe are about even better IDE support, new features &amp; etc and that&#x27;s where most of investments are. Well, and and obviously performance. Sorbet was already very fast and we intend to keep it fast as our huge codebase grows.')
