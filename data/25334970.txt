The iPhone was by far not the first smartphone but it appeared with optimal timing as it was possible to create something really polished while still having enough features. Also now low energy is a trend and having a fast laptop with passive cooling is just surreal.<p>The MacBooks seem inferior in many ways but if you compare just the fact sheets, they are just more close to what a mobile user needs. (Battery life, generally solid components, low weight, it just works - and if not you can go to the next Apple store)<p>Intel definitely went a few times in the wrong direction with Itanium and also all the CPU bugs (although ARM had them as well). But I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come up with something new if needed, this wouldn&#x27;t be the first time')
