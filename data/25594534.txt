An API might use a message queue as a transport mechanism.<p>The MQ only gives you a way to communicate, it doesn&#x27;t define how you structure your requests.<p>in your payment example, if you replace MQ with REST, it gives you the same answer.<p>Some message queues give you rich diagnostics for when messages fail. Others like NATS only give you the guarantee that the server will be up.<p>MQs come in many flavours. some act like python&#x27;s Queue, but allow you to use many machines.<p>Some are as you say, a buffer.<p>However I like to use them for connecting n transient instances of a service to an API front end. The routing is handled for you, and you can isolate services from each other.')
