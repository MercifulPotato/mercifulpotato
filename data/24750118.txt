I was just looking for a more scalable way to implement real-time communication for a hobby project <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lo.fish" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lo.fish</a>, an event space creation platform similiar to gather.town and sococo. (Right now the plan is to turn it into partially a Matrix client &amp;&amp; open-source a community version of it in the end of this month!)<p>Before stumbling upon Dendrite I was thinking about reimplmenting the backend in Elixir.<p>I have some exposure in both Go and Elixir. So am quite curious what are the list of things the Matrix team had gone through before deciding to re-write Matrix in Go instead of Elixir. Hmm perhaps one of the main reason was that Go has a much bigger ecosystem than Elixir? I always had the impression that writing a decentralised system in Elixir would be more straight-forward. Or perchance there are other more pragmatical aspects of things to consider?<p>(I&#x27;m compeletly new to this so any thoughts on it will be appreciated!)')
