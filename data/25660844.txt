You can implement functional tests with a loopback signal server. You can implement e2e tests with network emulation (e.g. using iptables&#x2F;iptraf). Automated testing using the browser WebRTC stack (obviously run basic tests in Node.JS for convenience) is annoying but doable with puppeteer or the like. Just takes time and effort.<p>The point of WebRTC vs hairpin&#x27;ed websocket streams is that the bulk data doesn&#x27;t pass through intermediate hosts, making the system less costly to run and more privacy preserving. Note that any TURN service required can always be provided or controlled by one of the parties -- it doesn&#x27;t have to be a centralized service.')
