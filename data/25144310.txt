I wrote this on the secondary effects a few months back (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;secondary-effects&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;secondary-effects&#x2F;</a>) and I think people are totally missing all the secondary effects.<p>When cancer detection rates go down, it doesn&#x27;t mean cancers went down, it means people aren&#x27;t coming in for their regular mammograms and colonoscopies. 5 months can mean the different between an early treatable cancer with a 5+ year survival rate and a stage 3 malignancy with the survival rate dropping by 1&#x2F;3.<p>Five years from now, we&#x27;ll look back and be able to see the massive secondary deaths from cancer, heart disease&#x2F;obesity (people stuck inside all day), depression&#x2F;suicide and others. This will not be a time of honor.')
