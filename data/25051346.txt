You have metrics, labels, float values, and millisecond epochs.<p>I&#x27;m not totally sure how they index things, but I would guess that it&#x27;s by time series with an inverted index style mapping for the metric and label data to underlying time series. This means they&#x27;ll have the same problems with working with high cardinality data that I outlined in the blog post.<p>InfluxDB aims to hit a broader audience over just metrics. We think the table model is great, particularly for event time series, which we want to be best in class for. A columnar database is better suited for analytics queries, and given the right structure is every bit as good for metrics queries.')
