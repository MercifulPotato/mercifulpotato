I&#x27;ve heard that from critiques of hydrogen burning, they said burning pure hydrogen is unacceptable due to high temperature leading to NOx emission.<p>Found this:<p>&gt; It is believed that an increase in the maximum temperature in the combustion zone above 1850 K leads to unacceptably high NOx emissions , and one of the main ways to reduce emissions by the thermal mechanism is to prevent the formation of hot spots in the flame front.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fru.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNOx_(%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?hl=&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=htt...</a>')
