It would completely upturn the map. You would see Republicans campaigning in New York and Democrats in Texas. Wall St. and Big Oil and Hollywood would gain influence, retirees in Florida and auto workers in the rust belt would lose it. It would redraw all the lines and fundamentally change both of the parties.<p>I think that&#x27;s really where you&#x27;re going wrong. Treating the members of each party as two different species, as though every voter for a given party has uniform shared interests with all the others. There is no such thing as &quot;Republicans&quot; being over-represented. Pennsylvanians are over-represented, which influences the party platforms of both the Republicans and the Democrats. Which allows them both to ignore California and Texas and New York, but also the entire dozen odd little deep red states that are supposed to be the most &quot;over-represented&quot; despite not being competitive at all and consequently being totally ignored by both parties.<p>&gt; The average state is currently much more Republican than the average American, amounting to 6.6% bias<p>The obvious flaw in the party-based analysis being that we&#x27;re currently going into a legislative session in which the Democrats control the Senate, which they do approximately half of the time. Because they adjust their policies to the map.<p>Also, the <i>purpose</i> of the Senate is to be this way, in the same way that Justices of the Supreme Court are not elected. <i>Senators</i> were not originally elected, they were appointed by the state legislatures. It&#x27;s by design as a check on the populist tendencies of the House, and causing Senators to be directly elected has only made everything worse by depriving the states of their voice in the federal government and the destroying the restraint on federal power that once implied.')
