The data shows it as accelerating.  Ok.  I&#x27;m still not willing to say &quot;alien civilizations exist and are using light sails&quot; based on a handful of observations of a single object.  One should hold off such monumental determinations until one has profound data available.  So once any discussion moves from &quot;it was accelerating&quot; to &quot;aliens are real&quot;, many serious scientists will just walk away.  They will come back once there is a more appropriate data set for such discussions.')
