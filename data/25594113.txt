Combined with performance improvements, you will almost always want to use a recent compiler.<p>Relatively slow moving package repositories are not a great fit for that reason. Rustup also handles installing support for various architectures - which are often not packaged well - and fast-moving tools like rust-analyzer.<p>The nightly situation has gotten much, much better though. Almost non of the popular crates still require nightly, and staying on stable is just fine for most projects.')
