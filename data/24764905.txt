Is it the fault of the lawmakers in my customer&#x27;s state? Or is it my fault for choosing an ingredient that&#x27;s banned in most US states? If I&#x27;m trying to maximize sales, the question of blame is irrelevant.<p>From a practical standpoint, it doesn&#x27;t matter whose &quot;fault&quot; it is that a Googler can&#x27;t contribute to an AGPL project. Choosing an AGPL or similar license prevents me from receiving contributions from people who otherwise might be interested in contributing.')
