Its like saying, well software just shouldnt have bugs or be vulnerable to side effects.<p>Of course it is possible to mitigate these issues more than most file systems do, but at the cost of reduced space or performance efficiency. Thats what using a further abstraction like SQLite buys you, but its not for free. Thats why all the FS as database efforts in the early 2000s like Longhorn failed.')
