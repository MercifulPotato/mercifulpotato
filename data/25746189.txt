Then a mathematician tweeted[2] about it convincing others to send some donations. After that kind gesture by him, I received 3 more donations. So pretty sure I can&#x27;t make a living out of donations. :-) But I still appreciate them because they help in covering a portion of the hosting cost.<p>Also, I never seriously expected donations for this project because I don&#x27;t work much on it these days apart from cleaning up spam from time to time, complying with legal notices and occasional maintenance. I added a donation button only to see if someone would use it. Apart from covering hosting cost, I think an important side effect of the donations is that it provides some additional motivation to continue working on the project and develop it further which I indeed plan to do as soon as I can find the time for it.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathb.in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathb.in&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;daveinstpaul&#x2F;status&#x2F;1345082256361193473" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;daveinstpaul&#x2F;status&#x2F;1345082256361193473</a>')
