If we look at some specific poll questions:<p>&gt; Moreover, fewer than half (47%) are able to correctly<p>&gt; identify that this statement is false: “A group of<p>&gt; Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are<p>&gt; trying to control our politics and media.” Thirty-seven<p>&gt; percent are unsure whether this theory backed by QAnon is<p>&gt; true or false, and 17% believe it to be true.<p>47% identify the statement as false, 17% identify it as true and I assume the rest are unsure. This sounds about right for most unproven things.<p>I would suggest that given the long list of powerful contacts Epstein is confirmed to have had, his seemingly random rise to wealth, the idea that he wasn&#x27;t a lone wolf isn&#x27;t insane.<p>Also you have to consider that something like &quot;Satan-worshipping&quot; is loaded, as to a religious person anybody conducting such acts could be said to be following the path of Satan. Given the large number of Christians in the US, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to believe this could have been misinterpreted.<p>&gt; Nearly half (47%) believe the majority of protests this<p>&gt; summer were violent, while just 38% correctly indicated<p>&gt; that this is a false statement.<p>I am open to be corrected, but by all accounts there was at least some form of arrests at most large protests and many of those were violence related. I personally watched about 20 random live streams on Twitch and each time there was somebody who got into a fight. I imagine they are conflating violent protests with riots (where you have a significant number of agitators)?<p>I remember watching some news reporter state that the protests had been largely peaceful as a building burned down behind him. I don&#x27;t think it could be argued that most large news outlets have become political in nature - historically the press and politicians would work hand in hand.<p>&gt; More than one in three Americans believe in the existence<p>&gt; of a so-called “deep state;”<p>My understanding is that the &quot;deep state&quot; is essentially the permanent state - groups such as the CIA, FBI, NSA, etc, that hold enormous amounts of power and act on scales longer than most presidencies and without democratic oversight.<p>I think that some of what this poll considers to be &quot;fact&quot; is simply from one of these &quot;fact checker&quot; services, which are based on existing evidence and general consensus rather than any kind of real investigation past a Google search by one random person.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipsos.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news-polls&#x2F;npr-misinformation-123020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipsos.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news-polls&#x2F;npr-misinformation-12...</a>')
