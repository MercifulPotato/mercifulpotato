It&#x27;s more expensive to buy, at best is 3X as expensive to fuel, is far more inconvenient to fill up (a grand total of 39 stations in the US), lower range (300 miles for current models), and is far less reliable (hydrogen embrittlement).<p>That&#x27;s assuming it&#x27;s powered by green hydrogen (aka, hydrogen created via electrolysis).   Grey hydrogen cracked from natural gas is cheaper than green hydrogen, but if you&#x27;re not going green, why would you get anything other than a gasoline car?')
