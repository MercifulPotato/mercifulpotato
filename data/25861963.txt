While I&#x27;m not an MBA myself, I was in investment banking and planned to get an MBA before I left finance and did something else instead.<p>I regularly pay engineers more than I pay myself as a CEO (granted: I am not really interested in draining the company&#x27;s coffers for my own benefit, since I have equity). It just seems obvious that, at the end of the day, so much of the business&#x27;s success turns on the engineering quality of the product, of the production lines, of the efficiencies, of the final delivered product quality.<p>While I take time to try to understand engineering issues, I am not an engineer by training and recognize that these people are much, much better at it than I am. So it&#x27;s strange to see all these MBAs -- the types of people I used to work more closely with -- simply not get it. In most industries, you simply can&#x27;t paper over operational and engineering incompetence with a slick marketing plan. So you need great engineering and operational chops. For many industries, more than a slick marketing plan.')
