Yet other lane keep systems disable themselves below 40mph which means you crash as soon as the car slows down to that speed.<p>What it <i>should</i> do is continue to aggressively lane keep, switch on emergency flashers, and sound progressively louder alarms until you wake up, but NEVER stop lane keeping, even as the car slows down below 40mph. It should lane keep all the way down to 0 and keep sounding the alarms.<p>What does Tesla do if you actually fall asleep and ignore the warnings?')
