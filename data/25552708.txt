Then when they retire, they will get SS benefits, which again is progressive, i.e., a slight transfer of wealth from the richer to poorer.<p>Also the less fortunate benefit from a whole host of post-tax transfer programs to assist them, also paid for by the more&#x2F;most fortunate.<p>Finally, both pre and post tax household income has grown for all quintiles for some time. So if the rich are somehow taking money from the poor and leaving the poor richer, it would be an amazing feat.')
