It doesn&#x27;t appear as though we all act to simply increase our options. Preferring options over reward may also constitute delayed gratification and sacrifice, which is another interesting can of worms, but can it be predicated in terms of just preference of options over reward when those are your only two artificial options?<p>Human behavior appears to point towards the maximization of current order as an investment in power&#x2F;potential to drive future entropy, as opposed to simply maximizing entropy. This is the difference between building a nuclear bomb and keeping it, as opposed to building the bomb to use it. When one was used, it was meant to end a war, not start one. And success in life may as well be defined by hoarding order, be it technologically, financially, socially, or just objects. The pyramids were a feat in lowering entropy, not increasing it. And we love our diamonds.<p>This is also an extrapolation from the evidence in biology that energy entering a system increases order and contributes to the orderly structuring of matter and hence life [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;a-new-thermodynamics-theory-of-the-origin-of-life-20140122&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;a-new-thermodynamics-theory-o...</a>')
