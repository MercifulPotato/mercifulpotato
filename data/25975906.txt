Item(by='dragonsh', descendants=None, kids=[25985863], score=None, time=1612066927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975485, text='&gt; criticising the central government<p>Conveniently leaving the truth that those state government which banned beef is same as central government (ruling central government party). People killed on suspicion of storing beef in home refrigerator is also perpetrated by central government party and its members (this is the reason no one got punished or prosecuted for mob killing). Central government has wide powers to initiate investigations and punish local officials as they have constantly done to muzzle political opponents in every state where they are not in power.<p>&gt; marriage act<p>There is a reason it’s called Hindu marriage act and it’s very patriarchal with lots of inconsistencies. Not just this, there are many laws in India which needs repeal or reform like laws on sedition’s which are conveniently used by current government to put people in jail without trial trampling basic human rights. For higher courts it’s important to judge what a comedian can say or not say and habeas corpus cases are just kept pending. A minister of central government is outraged and any court takes up the case with utmost urgency, and person languish in jails for years waiting for their habeas corpus plea pending hearing.<p>&gt; Muslim reforms<p>Let that community decide what reforms they want, don’t impose your will on them.<p>May be follow a bit of Buddhism to do self introspection and all will be evident.')
