He had done what he was asked for and did some some small, _almost_ day-to-day support request which was supposed to do some requested maintenance things for some credit card accounts our  company was handling. He by some small accident ended up invalidating the cards with our CC operator and closing the accounts on our end.<p>He was so wrecked about it and we, the more senior guys started helping him and comforting him that &quot;yeah, this kind of blunders can happen to anyone, no worries. Let&#x27;s figure this out together.&quot;.<p>The other guys figured how to restore the data into correct setup on our end, and I found some unimplemented badly documented &quot;undo invalidation&quot; endpoint from the CC operator with which we could fix the stuff on the operators end.<p>So we spent nice and fun evening together figuring out the problem as a team, but damn the guy was so torn up about his small and completely understandable fumble that nobody else needed to critique him about it.<p>The funny thing is that with this kind of blunders one learns a lot more and a lot faster than usually. People need to make mistakes. It&#x27;s usually the best way to learn.')
