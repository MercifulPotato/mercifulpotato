Using multiple tabs I have tried to time it and its all over the place, some streams netting an ad within each ten minute block and others with bigger gaps. Now I do question the logic of some ads, you can get condom ads on the oddest channels.<p>Partnered streamers seem immune to the ads or I just get lucky on them<p>Twitch Turbo, which does not contribute to steamers, will allow you to not see any ads but it only benefits twitch.')
