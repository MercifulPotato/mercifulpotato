Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, even Netscape 2 and IE 3. I think Web has taken a bloaty turn, but we still have a chance to retain and preserve the knowledge.<p>The nice part about it is that for every browser I tweak for, the site gets more and more compatible and accessible. As someone with experience, I&#x27;ve been able to access it under the strangest circumstances and methods.')
