I joined a large corporation in an R&amp;D role right after a year and a half stint in a university research lab. Ever since I joined as a Research Intern, I&#x27;ve been feeling lost. I have an idea of what I should be working on, but I feel lost once I get involed in the details and start working on stuff. I read stuff and I feel like I&#x27;m missing bits and pieces here and there. I joined earlier this year and it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and I keep feeling this way. I don&#x27;t have colleagues who check up on my progress either (my manager calls in about once a week), and whenever we do talk, I feel like there&#x27;s some confusion in my role. I keep feeling like I&#x27;m wasting my time, end up irritated which shaves off more of my productivity.<p>What do I do? I&#x27;m genuinely helpless and I&#x27;ve no idea how to cope. I&#x27;ll be here for another 5 months before I head for grad school, and I honestly thought that this would be a great experience, an opportunity to give it everything I&#x27;ve got.<p>How do I focus on my work? How do I establish relationships with my colleagues, especially in this remote world? I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on this HN.<p>Many thanks!')
