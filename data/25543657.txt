These costs are always fixed. No matter how much you earn. And therefore they are irrelevant to the opportunity cost.<p>For reference, if you earn 20k a month, your grocery expenses will roughly stay the same to earning 5k a month. They won&#x27;t be 35% of your income (that would be 7000â‚¬ of groceries for 20k of income). Working more hours does not result in higher grocery costs.')
