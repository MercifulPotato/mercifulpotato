I have found that I&#x27;m usually only interested in doing things I&#x27;m already good at, and cannot do well attempting to be an autodidact. The obligation of setting up and getting to an appointment on time means you have no choice but to have someone experienced see you work, and no choice but to have them guide you. If I am given a choice, as in left to my own devices without any other person to force or obligate me to keep going, I will usually end up stopping.<p>My biggest problem is either not being able to tell if I have actually made any progress, or have made too little progress over too long a period of time. It seems to be accepted that if you put in a lot of effort then you&#x27;ll get better, but they never mention how much better. I don&#x27;t see the point in getting to point X in 10 years when being smarter about my resources would have gotten me to point X in 3 years, if getting there faster means getting to the point where I actually start enjoying it faster. Time is precious and non-renewable. Some forms of practice are simply better than others, and I believe that I can&#x27;t always figure them out entirely alone.')
