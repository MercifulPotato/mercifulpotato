Then the cert can be passed to the router that&#x27;s running OpenWRT.  And after that, the DNS can start pointing to the router&#x27;s private LAN IP.  Repeat every time the cert needs a refresh.<p>To mitigate issues while the refresh is happening, the DNS server running on the router could intercept requests for its own name.  Of course that doesn&#x27;t work if the client on the LAN is pointing directly to an off-LAN DNS server, so it&#x27;s not a perfect solution.  But presumably, with a low A-record TTL, &quot;downtime&quot; of the local DNS name could be kept to a minimum, and the cert renewal could be scheduled to take place in the middle of the night.<p>Not sure if any of this process would violate LetsEncrypt&#x27;s policies and get the account banned, though.')
