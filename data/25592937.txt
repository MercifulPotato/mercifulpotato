He would say the most shameless things that would embarrass people while in their presence. For example - he would announce in the whole class who hadn&#x27;t taken a shower in a week or who wasn&#x27;t wearing underwear today (he would sometimes have this kind of information because we all used to live in the dorm.) Yet all the girls used to like him. Once I asked a girl why she liked him knowing that he says embarrassing and shameless things and makes jokes at people&#x27;s expense. Her response was &quot;what he says makes me laugh.&quot;<p>P.S - I had nothing against the guy personally. He rarely made jokes at my expense - he didn&#x27;t have enough jokeworthy material on me.')
