The police can&#x27;t just arrest you because you ran your mouth. There must be evidence. Now, if they can tie your confession with evidence they have, perhaps they have a case.<p>You can&#x27;t be arrested, tried, and sentenced for such fictional bluster about a crime that didn&#x27;t happen. And, as far as due process goes, there&#x27;s no crime without, at a minimum, a witness&#x2F;complainant, and hopefully some amount of evidence.<p>So the question becomes: assuming all this actually happened, do the authorities have evidence that it did, and can they tie it to the guy that has confessed?')
