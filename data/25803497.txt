At the moment we have blocks for landing pages and blog sites.<p>We launched version 1 in August of 2020 and this is version 2 that we just finished in December 2020.<p>What’s new in this version?<p>- More blocks were added (100+ blocks now).<p>- We redesigned all blocks.<p>- An online platform with a login system so we can update and add more blocks easily.<p>Why did we build it?<p>Premade templates have a lot of issues that Frontendor is going to fix:<p>1. Many templates come with unnecessary sections that you don&#x27;t need.<p>1. You can&#x27;t reuse their different parts (for example using the footer from template A in template B) because you can&#x27;t extract it or the code is different and can&#x27;t be merged.<p>2. License limitation (expensive for commercial use, limited projects, etc).<p>3. Bad UX especially on mobile.<p>What makes Frontendor different?<p>1. It fixes all the issues listed above.<p>2. The developer experience: most developers loved how easy and simple it is to build something by copy-paste unlike we see a lot of developers these days trying to overcomplicate everything.<p>3. Variety of design for each section which makes it easy to find exactly what you need.<p>4. You can use any block as React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte components because all that you need is to convert the HTML and Vanilla JavaScript in the block to your Framework.<p>The future of Frontendor.<p>This year we&#x27;ll design the dashboard blocks and If we reach our financial goal soon, we&#x27;ll move to add e-commerce website blocks too.<p>Who we are?<p>We are Hamza and Ali from Algeria. We work as freelancers most of the time and sometimes we make money from building and selling digital products.<p>More info:<p>Built with Bootstrap 4.5 (update to v5 will come soon).<p>We use CSS variables for customization (colors and spacing).<p>We don’t use jQuery in Frontendor but you can use it if you want.')
