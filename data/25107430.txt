If you tell Twitter what its platform can&#x2F;can&#x27;t support you are violating its freedom of speech. The 1st amendment applies to the government restricting speech - not private corporations.<p>In the 1800s not everyone had a newspaper to spread their ideas. That is not a violation of freedom of speech for the ones who can&#x27;t afford a newspaper. They aren&#x27;t entitled to a platform - they&#x27;re entitled to the government not restricting their platform.<p>What about a property on a busy road - a sign there has more impact than a sign at a house off the beaten path. You&#x27;re essentially arguing that because that property has more visibility, it is unfair to the other who doesn&#x27;t have that same location. This just isn&#x27;t how the constitution works.')
