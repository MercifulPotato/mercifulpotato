I&#x27;ve been WFH for a while and I need to get up, take a shower, get dressed, and go to my desk or I never really get going. Sometimes I&#x27;ll do some work on a laptop on the couch, but it&#x27;s the type of work where I&#x27;m more casually looking up information. Or I&#x27;ll print out something I need to read and go to the couch. Otherwise, I&#x27;m so much more productive and engaged when I&#x27;m at my desk with keyboard, mouse, and monitor.<p>My wife is the polar opposite. We&#x27;re lucky to be in a situation where we can both have dedicated home offices at this time. We already had a desk for her, but her work let her take home a good chair, and two monitors with a stand. We set up a really nice office for her, but I&#x27;d say that she works from bed or the couch 95% of the time. In fact, the only time she uses her office is when she has an important video call.<p>I don&#x27;t know how she does it, and I still believe that she would be more productive&#x2F;efficient at a desk. For me, just having the extra screen real estate and a keyboard and mouse are enough for me to want to be at my desk.')
