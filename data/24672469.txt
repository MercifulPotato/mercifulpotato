Python is shipped often as code, and if the std library would not include that much that&#x27;d mean that one had to ship lots of module code along.<p>So, rust would not actually profit from having a big standard library the same way Python does.<p>Having a big standard library makes it also harder to deprecate and remove cruft (&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;790677&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;790677&#x2F;</a>&gt;), which can get a problem over the long time.')
