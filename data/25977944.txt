Item(by='reallymental', descendants=None, kids=[25978054], score=None, time=1612091739, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977864, text='I think the comparison to 1928, and 2021 may be incorrect.<p>If we were to assume they&#x27;re both very similar, there would have been a bailout of banks around 1916 leading to QE and the rise in tide after. There was even a pandemic + war around 1918, so a crash should have occurred around then.\nAnd the &quot;fundamental&quot; drivers seemed to have been people buying stocks on credit (now margin) and the easy availability of credit. I don&#x27;t really see the easy availability of credit now, except for the stimulus checks, and they&#x27;re a write-off, not a liability for the gov.<p>If anything, we&#x27;re in for another roaring 20&#x27;s. But we must all buy raincoats in these 20&#x27;s as we know what came after.<p>I&#x27;m not a historian, nor am I right about many things, so please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.')
