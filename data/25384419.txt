I&#x27;d love to have a std lib recommended way of doing async and task execution with a  thread pool eg. Async-std vs Tokyo Vs Rayon.<p>They&#x27;re all individually great pieces of software but none of them feel complete and I always reach out for something that is not there.<p>To be fair I don&#x27;t think this is rust specific, I think this is just the bane of OSS solutions with unpaid maintainers.<p>Sure, I could contribute something or fork them but it takes time.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to just buy in into a solution, pay a monthly fee and know that I&#x27;ll get a full featured solution with a well paid maintainer.')
