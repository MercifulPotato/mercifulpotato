This happened for 3 trucks out of 847,000.<p>Corrosion-related recalls are fairly common for automakers, because it&#x27;s hard to anticipate which interior components will face corrosive elements, or how frequently, or in what amounts, due to the wide variety of geographies, climates, and uses that vehicles get subjected to.<p>Tesla has issued corrosion-related recalls itself, multiple times, including in 2018 and 2019, and these similarly did not make national news.')
