In this context it also means that if (eg) you print out the graph in a naive S-expression-style traversal you&#x27;d encounter 3 twice (eg &quot;(0 (1 (3)) (2 (3)))&quot; when each node is a list).<p>This sense comes from linear functions, which can be expressed with at most one use of their argument in the form λx(Ax+B) for A and B constant in x. (Under this scheme, x² would have to be expressed as x·x, which repeats x; linearity in programming languages generally allows <i>numeric</i> values to be duplicated freely, so this is only of etymological relevance.)<p>0: or possibly exactly once; I can never remember which of those is &quot;linear&quot; and which is &quot;affine&quot;.')
