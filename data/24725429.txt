It&#x27;s laughable to think that creativity will cease if we don&#x27;t allow 70 year rent-seeking on the products of that effort.<p>I think 90%+ percent of &quot;societally useful&quot; IP revenue would be preserved if copyright terms were only 1 year. If it was eliminated entirely, artists would move to crowdfunding and commission based methods of getting paid for creation.<p>I think the first half of last century&#x27;s music industry is an interesting example: back then the vast majority of artists rose to prominence by playing already-popular songs before transitioning into their own songwriting.  How much is creativity squelched by the current system where licensing is at the arbitrary discretion of the IP owner, and how should society weigh this against the potential reduced economic incentive to create works if cultural products become freely distributable?')
