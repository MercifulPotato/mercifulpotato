Takes a bit of work, for sure. But it&#x27;s the best and biggest federated network we have at the moment. Your custom domain can be secured by 2FA as well, if one is using a reputable registrar, and you can legally own it. So even if it&#x27;s stolen, there is recourse.<p>I really don&#x27;t enjoy this giving up on online sovereignty, just because of the convenience and some quasi-monopolists.<p>And I say that as someone who has very few accounts at any online-services (if avoidable, I&#x27;m not a fundamentalist, after all I am posting here right now) and runs mailserver (and cloudstorage and more). So I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s not all rainbows and unicorns, and I appreciate this is something that takes the skills and time that not everyone is willing to invest. Nor should they.<p>But one&#x27;s own &quot;domain&quot; (in the DNS and also the territorial sense) is something that enables some freedom in a world where power is increasingly being concentrated und surveillance is becoming so ubuquitous.')
