Make running a business simpler!<p>Your first year in business should not be spent on lawyers and accountants, but in Germany, it&#x27;s unavoidable. It&#x27;s a serious barrier to small entrepreneurship.<p>I run a simple website, and keeping it online takes a surprising amount of time. The law is damn hard to follow, even with the best of intentions. I don&#x27;t even want to think about hiring people.<p>Simplifying immigration would also help. I need to renew my freelance visa. I can&#x27;t get an appointment. Nobody can. I have to go to a government office at 6 AM and queue until 10 AM to get an appointment. It takes 2-3 months to get a visa in general. If you don&#x27;t speak German, you&#x27;d need an interpreter.<p>There are a few other steps I didn&#x27;t have to go through, but they&#x27;re not easier. Everything involves fighting for an appointment 2-4 weeks in the future, then trying to figure out your position in an opaque system. If you&#x27;re in trouble, good luck emailing or phoning anyone. The immigration authority answers in 3-4 weeks, if at all.<p>The list goes on and on. I can&#x27;t imagine building a disruptive business in such an environment. Running a blog is already a pain in the ass.')
