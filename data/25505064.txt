I&#x27;m certain a nuclear scientist could list a bunch of effects we&#x27;d see if a whole lot of neutrons were hanging around black holes and similar.<p>The whole point of dark matter is that observations show it interact extremely little, if any at all, with regular matter.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neutron_scattering" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neutron_scattering</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neutron_diffraction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neutron_diffraction</a>')
