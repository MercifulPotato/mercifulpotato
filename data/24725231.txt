Item(by='marta_morena_29', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602201026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725096, text='&gt; I do not believe API design of a math library is in any way the same level, having designed hundreds of APIs and several SDKs myself.<p>Oh given that the APIs were &quot;designed&quot; by Oracle, that stance might be relatable. However, designing actually &quot;good&quot; APIs will turn out equally complex if not more complex than arranging some recipes in a cookbook. Most stuff that Oracle does falls more into the category of a &quot;monkey throwing dart arrows at random code snippets&quot; and then suing the heck out of anyone who breaks their copyright or licenses (Oracle doesn&#x27;t make software, they make licenses and that&#x27;s how they earn money. The software is secondary).')
