Write me a better cat detector in SQL, or protein folder, or super-human board game player. And, by the way, ML does write SQL [1].<p>Deep learning has all these disadvantages and difficulties because we moved the goalposts too many times and now want so much more out of it than regular software. A model has to  be accurate, but also unbiased, updated timely and explainable and verified in much detail; also efficient in terms of energy, data, memory, time and reuse in other related tasks (fine-tuning).<p>We already want from an AI what even an average human can&#x27;t do, especially the bias part - all humans are biased, but models must be better. And recently models have been made responsible with fixing societal issues as well so they&#x27;ve become a political battleground for various factions with different values - see recent SJW scandals at Google.<p>With such expectations it&#x27;s easy to pile on ML but ML is just a tool under active development, with practical limitations, while human problems and expectations are unbounded.<p>[1] a neural SQL patent: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patentimages.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;af&#x2F;78&#x2F;be&#x2F;92ee342dc07692&#x2F;US10747761.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patentimages.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;af&#x2F;78&#x2F;be&#x2F;92ee342...</a>')
