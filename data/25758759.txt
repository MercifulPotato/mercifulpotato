Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610517891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758375, text='&gt;&gt; takes more paper to write the same text\n&gt; In practice, a text in Egyptian hieroglyphs and its English translation are more or less the same length.<p>I was careful in saying &quot;more paper&quot;, not longer. The hieroglyphs take up more vertical space. While in Japan, I noticed a book written in Japanese characters was significantly larger than the same book written in Romanji. I was surprised, having assumed that the more information-dense Japanese characters would implicitly take less space.')
