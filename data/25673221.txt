But when you plug in one such piece into a middle of a larger system (let&#x27;s say typical corporate IT landscape), then it becomes way more complex on all fronts. (Enterprise) architecture is also interfacing heavily with business decisions and company structure. You need to think a lot about how your ivory tower architecture will be actually used by the teams.')
