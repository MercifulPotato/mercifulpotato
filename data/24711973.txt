You and I both know more shiit is coming very soon.<p>But I get it. If I provide an email address and don&#x27;t get a confirmation email within 8 seconds I assume that either (1) I made a typo or (2) your platform is running on some bargain-barrel servers (and frankly I&#x27;m questioning my decision to sign up - i mean what kind of operation...).<p>Anyway, I found an easy solution to this annoyance (I think we all have): <i>Create an email account dedicated to SaaS sign-ups.</i>')
