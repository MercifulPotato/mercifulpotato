Those who are vulnerable to serious complications&#x2F;death from influenza <i>can</i> and should be inoculated with the latest influenza vaccine.  That <i>significantly</i> mitigates the risk for the vulnerable.<p>There is no corresponding vaccine for Sars-Cov2.  As such, the similar group who are vulnerable <i>can&#x27;t</i> mitigate the risk.<p>That&#x27;s why I (and many others) are trying to be much more careful.  I&#x27;d also add that while the IFR for those under 55 are quite low, they aren&#x27;t zero.')
