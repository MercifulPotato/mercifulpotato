Like a yacht.<p>Ironically, nobody questions the meritocracy of sports because it&#x27;s mostly evident that the best rise to the top.<p>Not always, and there are so many factors.<p>If you open up your next job position to less than qualified candidates you will see all manner of people come through the gates, most of whom - surprise surprise - are totally unqualified.<p>This whole &#x27;the world is not meritocratic&#x27; meme is really problematic and assumes there&#x27;s basically no ability for people to vet or understand each other when hiring, which is ridiculous.<p>Ask the nurse giving you a vaccine how long they had to study, how many exams they had to pass before they were allowed anywhere near you. No study, no pass, no job.')
