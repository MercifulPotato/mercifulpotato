(worth even kind of means the opposite)<p>Regarding all you critique: That is just how your culture is setup. Mostly males live a lonely live with each other, cf. the animal kingdom, where &quot;young males gather in groups until they get older, if surviving and might find (younger) females, then&quot;. If you go to mixed classes, like me, then there are a lot of girls, which have zero interest in you (but have some &quot;older&quot; boyfriend) and constantly are turned off by you and look down on you. Later you study computer science and &#x27;again&#x27; there are no girls. The situation improves, when you get older, though still <i>you</i> have to put in all the efforts (eg. have a nice hobby, that girls also share) to get a girlfriend <i>eventually</i>.')
