And crucially, the prototype X-32 failed to demonstrate simultaneous VTOL and supersonic flight, while the X-35 did. Seeing as this was the main characteristic the military wanted, this is a pretty significant shortcoming.<p>It&#x27;s true that more conservative designs have historically prevailed over technically more impressive exotic designs. I think this is not about looking cooler (the YF-23 looked cooler than the F-22 IMO), and more about risk aversion when billions of dollars and people&#x27;s lives are on the line. And there are still exceptions to this like the B-2. Although it drew on experience from the XB-35.')
