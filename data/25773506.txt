I never wrote a macro in Elixir. All that weird quote &#x2F; unquote stuff is too complicated. I get the idea (code running at compile time) but the syntax is just unwelcoming. Furthermore macros tend to make code opaque and onboarding difficult. I could wake in terror if I dream of my coworkers implementing some new functionality by adding macros instead of functions.')
