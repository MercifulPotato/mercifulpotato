The article links four tweets three of which have screenshots all showing only the twitch muted VOD section.<p>The author of the first linked tweet even corrected themselves a day later in a reply to the original tweet.<p>&gt;Thank you for all the reply’s and feedback! Im now understand that this isn’t a DMCA  takedown but just your everyday classic muted vod. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;YamiltonJay&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327669258776506368" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;YamiltonJay&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327669258776506368</a><p>The only tweet without a screenshot in the article that called it a &quot;copyright claim&quot; also switched to calling it &quot;a muted section&quot; in a separate tweet.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SL128T&#x2F;status&#x2F;1326949595511926784" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SL128T&#x2F;status&#x2F;1326949595511926784</a><p>A lot of people have been getting actual DMCA notices and strikes and bans usually for music but so far all the claims about sound effects I&#x27;ve seen were just the VOD muting system. Could still be happening of course but given the links the article cites I&#x27;d call the article headline misleading.')
