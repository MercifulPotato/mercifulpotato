I feel the fact that social networks keep recommending interests to the users (groups of shared interests or profiles of shared interest) will by definition lead to recommending more and more extreme content, further pushing the divide. Make no mistake, what&#x27;s happening now in the US is not only the fault of Trump as the leftist narrative is pushing, it&#x27;s both extremes feeding off of each other. They keep blaming each other without anyone willing to step back and try to reach a common ground.')
