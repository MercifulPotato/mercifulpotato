This is the GTK maintainer, who is about to release GTK 4 in a few weeks, and GTK 4 needs some unreleased fixes in Cairo. He requested a release earlier this year.[1]<p>The last stable release of Cairo was in October 2018. A very simple merge request[2] submitted by Nikolaus Waxweiler two years ago has not been merged even though everyone agrees it is good because nobody has been willing to take the responsibility to approve it.<p>The test suite is broken and tests were failing CI for all commits for a year (until the tests were disabled) because there was nobody who knew how the test suite worked who had time to fix it. There has been a proposal by a Google intern to add fuzzers for OSS-Fuzz to find security issuesâ€”but no maintainer has the time to review it.<p>Yes, there are a few commits and merge requests getting merged here and there, thanks to Uli Schlachter who is still active, but this is a large graphics library with many, many features, used by thousands of applications. It is not finished and not in a good state. Web browsers and other applications that have resources to move to Skia have done so already; GTK probably will not have spare resources to do this.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;422" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;422</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;cairo&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests&#x2F;...</a>')
