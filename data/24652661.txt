They&#x27;ll refuse to unlock physical devices while happily answering thousands of requests from the US and other govermnents for users&#x27; iCloud data[0]. They also don&#x27;t allow users to encrypt data stored in iCloud, expressly so they can continue to do this[1].<p>Apple&#x27;s front as a privacy company is little more than PR. I understand this isn&#x27;t really the point of your comment, but I think the privacy policies of Apple and Mozilla make for a misleading comparison.<p>Mozilla cannot have anything other than a huge positional advantage over Apple where privacy is concerned, mainly because the amount and type of personal data the two companies ingest are so vastly different. Were Mozilla to adopt Apple&#x27;s stance on privacy, results would be disastrous.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;transparency&#x2F;us.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;transparency&#x2F;us.html</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive&#x2F;exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT?il=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusiv...</a>')
