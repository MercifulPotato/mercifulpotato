Most of them were aware of this and attempted to stay ahead of the raids by monitoring some of the groups.<p>Their stories are horrific and to this day I have bad dreams about what I saw &#x2F; heard in those camps.<p>One of my coworkers escaped through the jungle to Thailand where I now live. He lost his brother and father to a group with machetes.<p>His story is incredibly depressing and makes me extremely grateful every day for what I have. We have spoken several times about the role of Facebook in what happened, and he has said repeatedly that nothing has changed and that it will happen again.')
