But the question comes down to being replaceable - could anyone replace Kelly Johnson and still create the SR-71?  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m not even sure Ben Rich would have succeeded.  But I&#x27;m confident not every single other person mentioned was irreplaceable.  In fact I&#x27;d venture 99% of those people could be replaced.<p>Likewise, it takes thousands of engineers to operate Google right now.  But do you really think most of those engineers are irreplaceable?  Meanwhile good luck finding replacements for Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemewat.<p>This notion that everybody is equally talented&#x2F;important is absurd.  And the idea that you can always make up for a lack of talent with hard work is pretty obviously debunked if you take even a passing glance at competitive sports.<p>I&#x27;m not saying a single person can do everything without help.  I&#x27;m saying a single person can have talent that you could never hope to have, no matter how hard you try, and that&#x27;s just the way it is.  And because of that talent, those people are more important when it comes to getting shit done.')
