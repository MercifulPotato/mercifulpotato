This is a limitation of bandwidth in the bluetooth standard AFAIK. Whenever I jump on a Zoom call with my QC35&#x27;s, they immediately switch to mono audio, at low quality, because the mic is in use. I am not sure this can really be solved at the hardware level, but if anyone could do it, it would definitely be Apple for a $550 price tag, possibly by including two bluetooth radios (one for talk and one for audio). But I haven&#x27;t seen any mention of this use case, so it seems like I will just have to wait for a new standard and new generation of BT devices.')
