Item(by='wgjordan', descendants=None, kids=[25119395, 25118689], score=None, time=1605570529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25116154, text='The &#x27;copyright violations&#x27; section of the RIAA letter (regarding the unit tests) was clearly a standard §512 notice alleging copyright infringement. Even if §512 wasn&#x27;t explicitly mentioned, it&#x27;s still a legally effective notification of claimed infringement.<p>&gt; The rules in section 512 do not apply.<p>Assuming you&#x27;re referring only to the §1201 &#x27;anticircumvention&#x27; portion of the claim (the main focus of the GitHub post), whether this portion is <i>also</i> subject to §512 rules is a little more ambiguous. §1201 defines a trafficking violation separate from copyright infringement itself, but some court rulings have established a requirement that §1201 violations establish a &#x27;nexus&#x27; to copyright infringement in order to be valid. If this requirement holds, §512 safe harbor protections could indirectly cover §1201 claims as well. However, because there&#x27;s a circuit split on the issue, unless GitHub is sued on this exact point it&#x27;s impossible to say for sure what rules would apply in this specific case.<p>In any case, GitHub handled the 1201 takedown claim in reference to its established, documented process in handling takedown notices and counter notices [1], <i>except</i> for the fact that it didn&#x27;t wait 10-14 days after receiving a counter notice before re-enabling this content. The deviation from their published policy is still itself noteworthy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-...</a>')
