Zero renderings of the graph :(<p>It <i>is</i> a nice user interface and the reference material is useful and well presented. But when you get down to it, it&#x27;s linear lists about the characteristics of a semantic graph. As I&#x27;ve said many times, this is like describing a tree with a tabular catalog of its leaves. Graph navigation needs a graphical representation, because things like branchiness (node out-degree) and other factors are more easily shown than described.<p>The basic problem with graph representation&#x2F; navigation&#x2F; traversal is that there are many valid ways of looking at the graph and it&#x27;s hard to render them all. Maybe try using a gutter to allow users to temporarily pin certain graph characteristics and render accordingly. In this context, sometimes I might be interested in the latest research that cites a paper, other times I might be looking to see who picked it up first, or to apply some sort of windowing function to a large spectrum of citations.<p>But I want to <i>see</i> the graph, even if I am looking for a particular leaf.')
