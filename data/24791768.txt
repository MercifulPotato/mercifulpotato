Even then, speaking only from the point of view of a much smaller business that has been a regular Facebook advertiser in the past, it probably left 33-50% of the money we would have spent with it on the table simply because we couldn&#x27;t spend that money on the Facebook platform due to all the bugs. We redirected those funds to other channels instead. And yes, we too only got around Facebook&#x27;s systems demanding nonsensical or literally impossible things that would have totally blocked our access at least once because we knew a senior dev who worked there and could escalate internally.<p>Unfortunately, this model seems to have become SOP for big tech service providers in recent years. Google are similarly non-communicative and have also provided such a bad experience to us as an advertiser that we stopped all our ads on their platforms for a long time. It&#x27;s not just the big advertising platforms, either. Every payment service we use (including some that are darlings of HN) has messed us around horribly over the years, too. Unless you&#x27;re spending literally millions of dollars per months with these tech giants, it seems they&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not commercially sensible to offer any meaningful support, and presumably to accept that in some cases they&#x27;ll lose customers entirely and damage their reputation as a result.')
