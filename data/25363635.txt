The fact is, they&#x27;re releasing these vaccines on a broad scale much faster, and with less safety testing completed, than usual. So there&#x27;s plenty of things that we <i>normally</i> wouldn&#x27;t know yet at this stage of development; in this case just leads to authorities being extra cautious, because this <i>is</i> an experiment. It&#x27;s just that with other vaccines the general public would never become aware of issues like that, because the vaccines wouldn&#x27;t have been released so early to so many people.<p>FWIW, looks like the HPV vaccine also had problems with occasional severe allergic reactions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-vaccine-reaction-idUSN3146783220080901" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-vaccine-reaction-idUSN314...</a><p>That article is from 2008, so I don&#x27;t know if that issue has been fixed or not. Regardless, it obviously wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker, as Gardasil is still being used.')
