It&#x27;s cheaper for YouTube for everyone to watch the same 30 videos than it is to spread those out, because then they have to brand safety reviews on each video.<p>There&#x27;s also going to be pushback from creators (and especially large creators) when they find out that YouTube is adding backpressure to their success.  It&#x27;s going to mean the algo helps you get some level of popular, and then it fights you getting really popular.<p>&gt; For a good example, see this video by &quot;How to Cook That&quot; author that laments how all the content farms around baking have gamed YouTube&#x27;s algorithm so that real bakers (who show recipes that actually work) have been pushed out by content farms showing eye candy on loops with impossible recipes<p>That author is misunderstanding the market.  I know a lot of people who watch those; they have 0 intentions of actually cooking the things they see.  To them it&#x27;s closer to art than it is cooking, where they appreciate the end result and don&#x27;t really care how the creator got there.  I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious from the format.  Those quick clips are an awful way to give cooking instructions, and they give none of the usual tips like &quot;when you&#x27;re done whipping, it should have the texture of...&quot;.<p>I think the style is inherited from Pinterest, where people constantly pin things they have no intention of actually doing.  I had an ex that loved Pinterest, but her whole feed was pretty much just &quot;Here&#x27;s 1,000 things you don&#x27;t have time to do unless you&#x27;re a professional creator&quot;.')
