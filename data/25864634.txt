An ISP is like a post office, and people’s letters should not be meddled with (outside of violent threats or pursuant to a legal criminal investigation). In particular, ISPs are relevant to most individuals and ISPs (should) have respect for individual rights. But large platforms like AWS are more like large-scale mail printing and  distribution, and is only really relevant to commercial enterprises. Such companies might choose to work with Sears to distribute catalogs, but decide not to work with Scientologists to distribute propaganda. They can be judicious in their choice of business partners without violating any individual rights - nobody has a right to any commercial partner they want. And in this case, AWS’s freedom of association rights (deciding not to do business with groups that aren’t federally protected, like the racist trolls who run Parler) are much more relevant here.<p>AWS refusing to do business with Parler is not the same thing as Comcast refusing to allow access to things written by Parler’s users. It is more like Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing refusing to put racist screeds in an ebook.')
