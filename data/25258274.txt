(With this question, subregisters shouldn&#x27;t be counted.)<p>This is something that has been bothering me for some time now - actually since the mid-80&#x27;s: why not implement multiple contexts as an index into a large register file? This way, a context switch would take the time it takes to write to the `task-id` register. It will impact latencies, but would the impact of having, say, 8 contexts not be smaller than having to hit L1 or L2 for the same data?')
