Going from zero to proof of concept is awesome but non-programmers don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know about design patterns.... and when &quot;real programmers&quot; were brought in to spruce up the hacked success they do what a lot of us do: lobby for a rewrite.  It&#x27;s awesome to see solid work going into analysis and refactoring tools for PHP: it&#x27;s the language that runs everywhere at the lowest cost (eg: budget web hosts) so it&#x27;s ideal for volunteer projects and non-funded ideas.  Kudos to Vimeo for helping to make PHP great again!')
