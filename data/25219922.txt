It&#x27;s the exact perspective the GP is addressing. You&#x27;re looking at the iPad product family and saying &quot;I want to use this for things other than the intended purposes.&quot;<p>Yes, the hardware is there. But that&#x27;s not relevant. Apple wanted a product that provides users with a mobile display--that&#x27;s all iPads really are.<p>&gt; In fact, I&#x27;m using an iPad air right now and feel held back by the limitations of iOS imposed on me as a developer.<p>There are no limitations imposed on you &quot;as a developer&quot;. Apple didn&#x27;t build a full-featured computer in iPad form and then said &quot;Okay, now let&#x27;s remove functionality to make it harder to code&quot;. Apple defined the needs of the product--a big screen and an easy touch-based interface--and built it. Sure, the hardware might able to do more, but it was never the intention for it to do more. It does exactly what it was designed to do.<p>The only limit imposed on you is the tools you&#x27;re allowing yourself to use.')
