BF is the cheapest, nastiest form of fuel available. They are a significant source of pollution in parts of many port cities like London (especially places like Greenwich). I believe they are particularly bad for sulphur and particulate pollution.<p>One of the differences with cargo ships is that cruise ships need a lot of power even when they are at port to keep all the amenities of a large town going. Most cargo ships have tiny crews,and little demand for power when not at sea. They are a significant producer of local pollutants that cause very real health problems for many people.<p>Some ports do have electrical hookups for the cruise ships to use, but I think they are often more expensive than just burning more bunker fuel, and require to ship to be set up for them.')
