It&#x27;s super easy to kick the tires on.  Installing Neo4j is the hardest part, but you can skip that by using one of their free sandboxes here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neo4j.com&#x2F;sandbox&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neo4j.com&#x2F;sandbox&#x2F;</a><p>Cartography has some good ideas in there.  For our case I am looking an event-driven model where the graph is continually updated as the environment changes.  Then i can hook those changes to do targeted analysis as needed.  I know HN loves to poo on serverless but the event-driven approach would be quite compatible with that as well.<p>For me the biggest challenge with any of this is trying to map the native data models of the cloud provider to something that is compatible with the simplistic property support in most graph databases (including Neo4j).  Things move too quickly to be constantly mapping the schema from provider to the graph, I&#x27;d much rather have a system where I can just plop the native content and iterate on that.')
