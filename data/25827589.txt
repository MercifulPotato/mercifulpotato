It can be made to work even in the real world. The rub is that coming up with these programmatic labelers is easier said than done especially for complex data.<p>It works well if a domain expert can say something without “cheating” and looking at the data like “put a box around round red objects because those are always apples”. But in practice people tend to cheat and look at the data first, and you end up with humans trying to emulate ML, poorly.')
