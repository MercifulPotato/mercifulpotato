From publishing to food-delivery (with upselling in the checkout process) - I found the gains in using rules -&gt; simple ML techniques -&gt; complex systems like NN in most cases not to warrant the costs.<p>The quality of recommendations nearly always increased from a revenue as well as perceived quality standpoint. However, it almost never had a positive impact on the profit margin that would have justified the necessary investments.<p>As said - from a quality standpoint most simple systems were just &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>One would need to know the business case and environment. But take automotive (new cars) as an example: The goal is nearly always to  get the user to request some form of contact from a physical dealership near them. For that you nearly never need a perfekt, fully configured recommendation.<p>I know of an example (a car manufacturer) where the search space of all configurable variants (including various things the car owner would never register because they are specific screw variants) is of a size where even the number of visitors to the website per year is some orders of magnitude less than the number of options.<p>The way to go here was to reduce the search space and the number of variants. Here it turned out that you can, quite fast, reach that goal with few specific questions (active learning) to lead the user to vehicle variants, which correspond to its interests and led to a disproportionately high contact behavior.<p>And yes: ML techniques were used for the analysis and reduction of the search space. For the concept people to then develop specific questions to get to these reduced attributes. But in the end the recommender now works rule-based.<p>I don&#x27;t imply that this holds true for every scale of company&#x2F;problem. And I know some counter examples - but most companies do not operate on that scale. If you are ebay, Zalando (Germany) and the likes: I would probably get different results from testing the revenue validity of the different approaches.')
