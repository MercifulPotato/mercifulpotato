Ffmpegthumbnailer for video thumbnails or imagemagick for image thumbnails are fine, but what about previews for things like ebooks or PDFs?   Something that provides a one-stop-shop for as many common filetypes as possible is what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>My current solution is controlling a floating mpv window to open image, video or audio files as they are selected.  This works well for A&#x2F;V but not so well with other sorts of documents.')
