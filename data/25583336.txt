There’s no body posture, no gestures, no facial expressions, nothing to go on. There’s a computer in control of a powerful heavy machine that you’re just expected to trust.<p>This is something that&#x27;s very solvable though. Robot cars should and almost definitely will have a way to communicate to pedestrians. I agree with the general point though around a greater possibility of very out of the norm mistakes.')
