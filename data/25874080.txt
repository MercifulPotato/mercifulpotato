I too have had a drastic transformation in terms of life quality.<p>I second the Anti-inflammatory diet and exercise (even just walking contributes greatly). I echo the supplement suggestions and also recommend glucosamine+chondroitin (which happens to lower all-cause mortality significantly).<p>Red meats (high omega 6 content), deeply fried foods, gluten (plenty of grain alternatives to wheat and corn), uncultured dairy (cheese seems ok, plenty of alt-milks out there), and sugar not from fruit can trigger inflammation for me. I might describe my diet as vegan+eggs+fish (ovo-pescaterian?)<p>There is a wealth of information online to tailor one&#x27;s diet. Honestly - this is a diet that everyone can benefit from health wise.')
