Just the ones that compares the current implementation with some untenable ideal or with the status quo in the developing countries. Saying &quot;I can send one million dollars or 20 dollars easily to anyone without blockchain&quot; is no different than a &quot;Let them have cake&quot; to someone in Argentina who would like to work as a freelancer with European customers. Saying &quot;blockchain is never going to compete with Visa&quot; is a big fuck you to the small business owner in Rio who needs some rotating capital to their shop and the bank is offering &quot;competitive rates&quot; of 2%&#x2F;month.<p>&gt; Pushing a world without them onto these disadvantaged folks.<p>It has <i>very little</i> to do with &quot;disadvantaged folks&quot; or &quot;not having access to financial services&quot;. It has more to do with enabling whatever-you-can-call &quot;middle class&quot; to be able to protect their wealth and to do their business without being harassed by corrupt government officials, or having their savings inflated away by government that can not&#x2F;will not manage their finances and even to enable them to make business with foreign entities without getting ripped off by abusive&#x2F;unfair taxes.<p>&gt; Intermediaries are a massive optimization and solve a ton of problems.<p>No argument there. But again, the problem is when people <i>don&#x27;t have intermediaries they can rely on</i>. If you show me any non-blockchain alternative where people are free to <i>choose</i> if they want intermediaries or not, then I will gladly support it.<p>As everything in designing systems, there is no solution free of trade-offs. Forcing people to depend on institutions and to accept centralization is a clear trade-off between performance and robustness. Too much optimizing and not focus on robustness brings you to a system that is so inflexible that becomes dangerous. It works well until it doesn&#x27;t. When it fails, it fails spectacularly.')
