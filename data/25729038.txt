The free market has become a bit of a religion for some (you can see in the comments here), and there&#x27;s this staunch divide between those that believe the free market will always come up with a humanitarian solution, to those that believe the government need to push things for it to happen.<p>My FIL was head of a large coal plant in the UK, and is very critical of renewable energies, their cost, the impact on the fossil fuel industry etc...  It simply isn&#x27;t possible to have a conversation with him about global warming - he will simultaneously argue it isn&#x27;t happening and it&#x27;s natural and not caused by us.  He might be an extreme example, but there is general scepticism of government subsidies here.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a study where researchers take things that are seen as good&#x2F;important&#x2F;essential to modern life and measure the amount of public&#x2F;government sponsorship that helped bring it about.')
