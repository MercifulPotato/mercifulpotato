Why should it be? The user is not interested in your internal representation. An &quot;ID&quot; does not imply semantic meaning, or ordering, and you should not treat it as such.<p>If you want to order by creation time, then have a column with creation time. With resolution down to nanoseconds it&#x27;ll be unique. And if not, well your query should be deterministic and &quot;order by ctime,id&quot;.<p>But the problem is always possible. Doesn&#x27;t matter what method you use. It applies to OFFSET â€¦ LIMIT, guid, name, or ID.<p>It&#x27;s up to you to decide what you want the user experience to be if someone is on page 1, presses &quot;next page&quot;, but before you click someone deleted the entire first page. And maybe there is no page 2 anymore.<p>These questions are application dependent, I&#x27;d say. And while I may have my opinions on the best way to handle it, it&#x27;s an orthogonal question to what this article is talking about.<p>Edit: Oh, and there&#x27;s GUID type 1, so &quot;GUID&quot; doesn&#x27;t inherently mean &quot;not sortable&quot;.')
