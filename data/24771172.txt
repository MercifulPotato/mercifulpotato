Item(by='bonoboTP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602629132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764236, text='&gt; Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks are still mostly adequate terms for what&#x27;s going on in the industry thus abusing of term &quot;AI&quot; (artificial intelligence) makes it just a marketing BS.<p>It&#x27;s true that the terms ML and ANN predate the current hype but they were introduced&#x2F;kept in use for the same reason: talking in mathematical terms does not excite research grant decision makers or business customers. Neural is a buzzword, it&#x27;s easy to interpret for laypeople. If you talk about Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Support Vector Regression, Projection Pursuit, Principal Component Analysis, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation etc etc, then people yawn.<p>Why do we call linear programming &quot;programming&quot;? It has nothing to do with machine instructions. The answer: the name was made up for the hype and for securing research grants, when math funding was dry, but CS research was popular.<p>Why call &quot;dynamic programming&quot; like that? What&#x27;s dynamic about it? Because the inventor wanted a name nobody can object to and sounds buzzy enough.<p>People try to name things in sexy ways to gain an edge.')
