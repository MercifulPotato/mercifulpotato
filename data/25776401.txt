For one, some of us are doing this (informally) with support from management. In emails signature, zoom calls, mural&#x2F;miro screennames etc.<p>For another, we do this internally but not externally. We work with a tremendously, broad spectrum of people to generate social good. Some of these stakeholders would not receive this well, but at the same time actively invest time and money on key common areas (be it women&#x27;s health to child mental health).<p>So in this organization, I think we would have to think throughly about the potential to alienate some stakeholders that sets us back on other social good activities.')
