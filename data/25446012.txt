Money, attention, a monthly trip to the movies, a meal, etc.<p>Facebook competes for your time and attention.  The ringtone company was competing for a share of a kid&#x27;s allowance.  A local outdoor skating rink competes with building snowmen, even though the latter isn&#x27;t a company-provided service.<p>Nearly all products and services compete for a user&#x27;s time, even if it&#x27;s only the time spent deciding to buy it.  Facebook wants more of our time, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an advertising platform.  Most services try to cut down user time.')
