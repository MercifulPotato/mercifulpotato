Let’s say you have 10 glasses, with 10 different amounts of water in them. When you hit them with a spoon, each glass makes a different musical note: 10 different notes.<p>If you pour the water from each glass individually into 10 new glasses, you preserve those 10 notes.<p>If you combine every two glasses into one, now you have 5 glasses, and only 5 notes. It’s the same total amount of water but you lost information.')
