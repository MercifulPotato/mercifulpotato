Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603065341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820829, text='yes, it is a somewhat baffling feature. the only practical use I can imagine for it is to avoid calling the copy constructor with an invalid instance of the type and&#x2F;or to avoid a heap allocation. otherwise, it would be much more natural (and no less safe) for a c++ programmer to just use some flavor of pointer. in the case of pair&lt;bool,T&gt;, one would expect an optimizing compiler to skip the constructor call for an invalid instance anyway if the object was only accessed after checking the bool (unless the constructor has side-effects, yikes!).')
