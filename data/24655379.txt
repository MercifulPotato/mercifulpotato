For instance, reading about World War 1, finding the account written in the 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s can be very informative.  Of course those histories have bias but so do modern histories.  Reading both and comparing the two provides even more benefit.  Newer histories, in spite of their bias, may have more accurate facts or facts from records that were not available to the historian of 1920.  But the mores and culture of the 1920&#x27;s also plays a role and no modern historian can reproduce that.')
