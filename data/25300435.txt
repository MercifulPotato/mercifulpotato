And it scares me that I already do this.\nI used to deliver as quick as possible and working my ass off and finding that the only thing it got me was a little praise and that more was expected from me the next time. Now I&#x27;m browsing HN during work time still delivering within deadlines, just not a week ahead, and most importantly, I feel like I&#x27;ll be sane doing this work for more than a year.')
