Yes, complex math is able to predict the behavior of the quantum world. So what? OpenGL is also able to predict realistic pictures. Is knowledge in OpenGL mechanics will improve our knowledge in the physics?<p>My teacher told me, that I will really know physics when I will be able to derive my own equations.
