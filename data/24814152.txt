Of course we do.  Influenza rapid tests are among the most common diagnostics during flu season.  Epidemiologists rely on these tests as well as serological surveillance to derive IFR estimates for the various flu bugs, just as they do for covid.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Your assertion was that flu and covid IFR&#x27;s are &quot;apples to oranges&quot; because we&#x27;re taking measures to reduce covid infections.  This is nonsense on the simplest logical level.  Reducing the infection rate doesn&#x27;t reduce the danger to the individuals who do get infected, as long as the standard of care remains stable.')
