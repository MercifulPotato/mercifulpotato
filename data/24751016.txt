Further since Software &#x2F; IT industry is huge I would identify at least 2 categories for workers there. One mainly enterprisey CRUD peddlers, or just setting up and customizing large packaged software etc. They often work at large consultancies. For them this is just job that pays good. These folks don&#x27;t even understand there is something called side&#x2F;personal projects.<p>Second category who work on large custom build applications,  likely enjoy good software craftsmanship. They got chance to be part of challenging projects. They think of getting even better jobs or just plan to write some personal projects which may even be useful at work.<p>Now when it comes to hiring I do not know if hiring folks &#x2F; HR really identify these 2 categories. To me it seems every application is evaluated as software developer without analyzing context on what kind of work is done at what kind of companies.')
