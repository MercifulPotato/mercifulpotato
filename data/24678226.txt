Do you miss these conversations?<p>I worked as a contractor in the office and never really thought about it. Like I had conversations with people in the break roomwhere they know me maybe because they see me  talking to my boss but I don&#x27;t know who they are or what they do. Or I overhear people talking about their work and I got to catch a glimpse of what they do (I wrote internal  web applications they used so this was useful information to me).<p>I&#x27;ll never admit this, of course. I don&#x27;t like being in the office. I&#x27;d rather work from home forever. I think all I&#x27;m missing is a decent fiber gigabit (symmetric up and down) connection (for me and everyone else) and I should be good.')
