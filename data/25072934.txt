My point was, that at the time of Python&#x27;s creation, all those languages existed and have taste. The fact that they were ignored in Python&#x27;s development is an example of it not having taste.<p>The best example of this is Python&#x27;s scoping rules. When something like Scheme or ML exists and you end up with Python&#x27;s scoping, it&#x27;s hard for me to understand where the taste is.')
