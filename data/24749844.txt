So if you&#x27;re not stupid, and you already know this, why did you take the time to point out some pointless flaw in my wording?<p>I&#x27;ll tell you why. Because you liked this analogy. You thought it was profound to compare learning to DFS and BFS and fractals and you were sort of offended when someone like me didn&#x27;t find it profound. Not only do I not find it profound, I find it obvious and trivial. Comparing learning to fractals is like some offhand thought I can have for like 5 seconds than forget about because it&#x27;s so trivial.<p>Too each his own man. If this article blew your mind great. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.<p>Here&#x27;s another analogy for you.<p>Learning is like traveling down a path and encountering a several forks in the road. You can BFS the paths or you can DFS the paths<p>Replace Learning with &quot;Life&quot; and remove BFS. In life you can only choose one path every time you encounter a fork and the decision is permanent. No popping the stack like in BFS to try the other paths. It&#x27;s just DFS all the way to the last final leaf node. You have one life so live it right.<p>Did that analogy blow your mind? Because I made it up 3 seconds ago. That&#x27;s how trivial these analogies are.')
