The usual pushback of saying that we should hire the best person for the job and that enforcing quotas like this hinders a company from performing optimally, is too simplistic. There are going to be plenty of people who are qualified for each position.<p>I remember hearing about a competitive university back when I was a kid where if you didn&#x27;t have a 4.0, you were not able to get in and, in fact, even if you did have a 4.0, you had to participate in a lottery (this was Karolinska in Stockholm Sweden, and I guess the admissions process was pretty straightforward back then). Just like that scenario, there are going to be more than one qualified person for each position -- even executive ones.')
