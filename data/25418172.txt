The language feature that enables it is deterministic destructors, whose primary purpose is to ensure that allocated resources are deallocated.  RAII is one particular use of destructors.  The primary goal is to have the object be the thing that owns a resource, not the calling scope.<p>In terms of usability, destructors allow for resource management that is far easier at the call site than any other language.  &quot;with&quot; blocks such as in python require the call site to be modified to include the explicit time of destruction, whereas C++ gets that for free from its existing scoping rules.  &quot;try&#x2F;finally&quot; such as in Java also requires modifying the call site, but at least has reasonable default behavior if accidentally omitted.  &quot;defer&quot; feels like it has the worst of both worlds.  It requires the call site to be modified when a resource is owned, and also requires the caller to know what the corresponding cleanup function is for any allocation.')
