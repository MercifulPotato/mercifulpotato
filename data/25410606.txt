They argued that dedicated bike paths would limit the freedom of cyclists, since they would be obligated to use these paths.<p>In hindsight, this was a missed opportunity to build this infrastructure at a time when cycle usage (and therefore public support) was very high... and cycle participation has plummeted in the decades since to 1.7% of all journeys. Now, cyclists have the right to use all UK roads (except motorways), but only the bravest actually do so.<p>Meanwhile, the Netherlands has fantastic cycle infrastructure and participation is very high - although still lower than it once was in the UK! I don&#x27;t think it is hyperbolic to say that given what we now know about climate change, harmful emissions and the health consequences of inactive lifestyles, this is a national tragedy.<p>Good cycle infrastructure encourages more people to cycle, and the rights of cyclists are better protected in societies where more people cycle.')
