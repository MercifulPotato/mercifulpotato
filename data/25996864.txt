You have to pick and choose where you want to explore next, and you&#x27;re always left wondering what else might lie beyond. You have to value every trek. And even at the maximum (I think I got roughly as far as it&#x27;s possible to get along the valley by optimizing my path...), you still can&#x27;t see the whole thing. I thought I caught a glimpse of a cabin just beyond the treeline. Realistically there&#x27;s probably nothing there, but I&#x27;m going to choose to believe there is something more just out of reach.')
