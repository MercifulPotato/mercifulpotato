That feature is probably vastly more impactful than improving system integration.<p>For there to be features like that, or an ecosystem of third party integrations, speed of development is likely a huge factor, and for that, being able to share the codebase across web and desktop apps is likely a no-brainer.<p>As much as I&#x27;d love to see a more performant Slack, it&#x27;s likely that it would have large negative impacts on the speed of iteration elsewhere, and so I can understand why they don&#x27;t do it.<p>Yes there are faster Electron apps, but typically they manage that by... not being Electron apps in certain areas, and sacrificing adaptability for that.<p>Also, Slack doesn&#x27;t change _that_ much right?! Well yes and no. As an end user we probably only get ~10% of the changes â€“ 90% may be experiments that never see the light of day but still have to be built in order to find the 10% that are worth it. And even then, assuming the new features are only designed for ~50% of users, because users don&#x27;t typically use every feature of a product, you&#x27;ll only actually see 1 in 20 changes that the Slack team build.')
