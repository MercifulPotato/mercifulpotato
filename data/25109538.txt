I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon (mainly because their delivery is - usually = reliable, their selection is good and their return policy is generous) but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I bought anything by clicking on an ad. That didn&#x27;t happen for many years at least. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure I ever bought anything on Amazon by clicking on an ad, if you exclude affiliate links and people just reviewing stuff and then giving Amazon link.')
