Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[24918452, 24918770], score=None, time=1603890509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24918072, text='Apple should buy DDG, rebrand it simply as Duck (plus they already have the domain), leave the privacy focus fully in place and have Weinberg run the search division, and push a large investment of capital into turning DDG into a full-fledged independent Google competitor. Of course I&#x27;d worry that Apple wouldn&#x27;t be able to help themselves and would try to call it Apple Search (Search by Apple), and the web location would be something absurd like search.apple.com or apple.com&#x2F;search instead of duck.com.<p>If Apple builds a modestly successful search engine for their iOS platform, it&#x27;s going to hurt Duck&#x27;s absolute growth potential. It&#x27;d be better for everyone if they just buy them and ride + improve existing momentum.')
