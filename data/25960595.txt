They should stop thinking they’re ‘so speshul’ and go see a competent doctor.”<p>&gt;&gt;Beth answered something along the lines of “I diagnosed myself with autism, but only after a lot of careful research. I don’t have the opportunity to go see a doctor. I think what you’re saying is overly strict and hurtful to many people with autism.”<p>&gt;&gt;Alice then proceeded to tell Beth she disagreed, in that special way only Tumblr users can. I believe the word “cunt” was used.<p>Alexander explains what&#x27;s going on as:<p>&gt;&gt;Beth chose to stand up for the people who self- diagnosed autism without careful research. This wasn’t because she considered herself a member of that category. It was because she decided that self- diagnosed autistics were going to stand or fall as a group, and if Alice succeeded in pushing her “We should dislike careless self- diagnosees” angle, then the fact that she wasn’t careless wouldn’t save her.<p>&gt;&gt;Alice, for her part, didn’t bother bringing up that she never accused Beth of being careless, or that Beth had no stake in the matter. She saw no point in pretending that boxing in Beth and the other careful self- diagnosers in with the careless ones wasn’t her strategy all along.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slatestarcodexabridged.com&#x2F;Weak-Men-Are-Superweapons" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slatestarcodexabridged.com&#x2F;Weak-Men-Are-Superwea...</a>')
