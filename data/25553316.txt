Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609095406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550513, text='I almost really liked Offworld Trading Company, but I feel 1. there aren&#x27;t enough ways to win as an underdog, and 2. the devs punted on the end-game.<p>The outcome is too momentum-based. Once a player builds a solid early game lead, there is pretty much no way to stop them. There aren&#x27;t really any offense tactics besides monopolizing resources, which pretty much has to happen early on. The various &quot;black market&quot; sabotages are pretty weak and expensive. None of them will stop a late game player with momentum. It feels like your starting position and the decisions you make in the first 1-2 minutes of the game pre-determine the outcome 30 minutes later--which is boring.<p>The stock trading system (which is ultimately the only way to win) is simplistic and just not a satisfying way to end the game. You&#x27;re sitting there trading, making tons of money, doing everything right, then suddenly Game Over--someone had more money and decided to buy you out, which you can&#x27;t defend against, even if you pre-buy all your own stock. You get a warning a few seconds before it happens (the red percentage number next to your opponent) but there&#x27;s literally nothing you can do to stop them.')
