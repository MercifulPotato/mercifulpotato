They cost about $650. They come preinstalled with unnecessary Norton antivirus software (which defaults the installation of a lighter version in its standard uninstall flow), Dropbox, Firefox, ads for Netflix and Amazon on the desktop, and a persistent “Would you like to use Skype?” popup program separate from Skype itself. Consumers have a clear choice to tolerate this bloat, or to pay more to Apple to avoid it and ensure only high quality software runs on their computers.')
