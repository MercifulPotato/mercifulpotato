You just can&#x27;t compete with them because you&#x27;re right: They are a MUCH better product.<p>Not because they understand the software better than you (although I&#x27;m not saying they don&#x27;t either), they just have more resources.<p>Why can&#x27;t we work together instead of being in direct competition, you know? There must be a way to do that')
