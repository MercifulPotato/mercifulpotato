Again, this would be doublespeak, and you would be a liar. I&#x27;m just trying to maintain a grip on the real world here and it&#x27;s pretty tough when you are so committed to gaslighting yourself and others. Honestly I&#x27;m only getting hung up on this right now because I think it&#x27;s for your own good. You clearly have a loose grasp on reality if you&#x27;re so eager to ignore government intervention, and you&#x27;re going to get got sooner or later if you keep on with this irrational belief in free markets.')
