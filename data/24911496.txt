A couple decades ago I was present when someone asked an executive why they don’t sell many EVs.  His response was a lack of demand. At the time there really wasn’t much demand.<p>EVs are still not a slam dunk. Battery recycling is an issue. I’ve talked with people who handle car fleets and there are still other issues for them.<p>I look forward to these things being solved.
