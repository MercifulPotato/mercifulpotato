Its more like the the linter is getting stricter over time. Your test will still pass at runtime, but they might start failing at compile time.<p>Also, for the cost of dealing with a breaking linter once and a while it helps enormously with upgrading javascript libraries provided they have up to date type definitions. If an API changes you are immediately alerted to many of the places where your previous assumption are now wrong.<p>It also completely changes the way you write code. Often time you can just go to the leaves of your application, make the change you want, and then just follow the compiler errors all the way back up to the top. When it compiles there is decent chance that it will run successfully first time.')
