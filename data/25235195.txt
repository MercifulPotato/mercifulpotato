There are nuggets of truth there, the biggest one being &quot;A recruiting team that looks like a college admissions office is certain death for a startup.&quot; That is undoubtedly true IMO. But toward the end it goes off the rails, with the stuff about working 5-hour days revealing a lack of commitment and indifference. The reason why Google engineers can work 5-hour days is because they are a large company, not a startup, and they can direct resources more efficiently than a startup and devote engineering hours to core problems instead of startup-style &quot;all hands&quot; processes. So IOW, if engineers are working 5-hour days, does it really surface not giving a shit? I&#x27;d say &quot;it depends.&quot; It depends on whether you are a startup or a Big Corp, and it depends on the company culture and workflow. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an A&#x2F;B indicator of passion for the company or the product.<p>Overall though, this post left a bad taste in my mouth, and I could only keep thinking that I&#x27;d never want to work at Scale.')
