They understand it. They just implicitly recognize that humans are rationalization machines, that their reasons don&#x27;t matter. Every single person in human history, no matter how abhorrent, <i>had their reasons</i>, had a whole litany of reasons that they could recite. Plenty of them were able to convince other people they were right, too. That&#x27;s how you get everything from mass surveillance to genocides.<p>Now, it&#x27;s part of being human that we recognize that in <i>extraordinary</i> circumstances, maybe those exigencies can justify or ameliorate your wrongs. But every single person in human history is going to be able to explain to you why that applies to their case, that they <i>had</i> to do it.<p>But the fact remains nearly all of them didn&#x27;t.')
