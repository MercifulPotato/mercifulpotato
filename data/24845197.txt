Here are a few things where it seems that Julia is not strictly superior to Python:<p>Julia doesn&#x27;t run everywhere that Python does. Especially if you include all of the Python implementations, including MicroPython.<p>Last I checked, Julia&#x27;s startup cost was high, making it the wrong choice for short-lived programs. Yes, people do scientific computing in short-lived programs.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know where Julia stands in this, but Python is used to teach people to program, including high school students and younger. By the time Python was 8 years old (as Julia is now), Python was being used in high school courses. Python&#x27;s built-in &quot;turtle&quot; module exists as part of that education component - at one Python conference, an educator pointed out that it can be very hard to get anything installed at primary and secondary schools, so having a maintained &quot;turtle&quot; in the base installation was important.<p>I therefore suspect Julia is a worse teaching language than Python for high school level and below.')
