Fractional reserve banking without a backstop is dreadful and was a major contributor to the Great Depression. Luckily, we learned from that and created the FDIC. It&#x27;s not at all the same thing and you cannot consider fractional reserve banking to be equivalent to fractional reserve banking <i>with a backstop</i>.<p>The mechanics are different too, where a bank loans money it doesn&#x27;t have and leaves itself with a negative balance until the loan is repaid (which btw, also has to be backed very carefully). They&#x27;re just printing money to buy BTC and pump it.<p>Last, they also <i>don&#x27;t owe you any money or other assets</i> if you try and withdraw. They can say no, and tell you to stuff it. Read their T&amp;Cs on their website.<p>&gt; That said, if Tether is revealed to be a fractional reserve...<p>What do you mean? Their lawyer admitted it in court two years ago.
