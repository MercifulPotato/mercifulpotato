SQLite and Postgres are both relational databases, it stands to reason that they’re at least doing things in <i>similar</i> ways. They’re two implementations of the same idea(ish). A graph database is something else altogether. Grafting that capability onto a relational database has the potential to perform horribly.<p>It’s a bad analogy, but SQLite to Postgres is like AMD vs Intel x86 CPUs, whereas a graph database is ARM. Can it be emulated? Yes.  Is there a far greater potential for slowdown? Yes.')
