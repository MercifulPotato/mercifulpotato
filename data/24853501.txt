The part that&#x27;s only implied is &quot;and stop tracking me, stop making recommendations with the sole purpose of distracting me&#x2F;keeping me here longer, etc&quot;. The part that isn&#x27;t said is &quot;stop treating me like the product&quot;.<p>No one wants to pay for something where they&#x27;re still the product being sold. Youtube Premium still has all its trackers, still recommends videos not that it think you will find interesting but that it thinks will keep you watching (for better or worse), and still feeds all of your data into the Google ads network for companies to target you on <i>other</i> websites.')
