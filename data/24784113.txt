This gives me way more positioning freedom for my phone. These strips are neodymium and at least ~7 times stronger than every other magnetic strip. (which all use ceramics).<p>You can find the magnets I&#x27;m talking about on McMasterCarr [1] or just search for &quot;NeoFlex magnets&quot;.  Besides McMasterCarr, I can only find them from European sellers.<p>IMHO, anyone buying adhesive magnet strips would be happier buying these, but no one advertises any sort of standardized magnetic strength per area unit. This makes the differences very hard to determine for most consumers.  The typical flexible ceramic magnets, like this one [3], support 70g&#x2F;cm2 [4], while the NeoFlex ones I mentioned support 400g&#x2F;cm2. ( 800lbs&#x2F;sqft)<p>Also many people try to stick magnets to magnets, works works for typical magnets, but that doesn&#x27;t work well at all for the multi-pole magnetic strips like these. It works just enough that people blame the magnets for being weak, when really they might be quite strong if you just used a thin steel plate instead.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcmaster.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;3651K8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcmaster.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;3651K8</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;NeoFlex-Flexible-Neodymium-Magnetic-3M&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01IVJQQ7C" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;NeoFlex-Flexible-Neodymium-Magnetic-3...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B005HYA2SE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B005HYA2SE</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=12lb+%2F+%281%22+*+12%22%29++in+g+%2F+cm2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=12lb+%2F+%281%22+*+12%...</a>')
