They have already had &quot;not advertiser friendly&quot; caveat which is a way of just disqualifying anyone they like.<p>There has been several moral panics incited by the conventional media (TV, newspapers etc) about adverts being displayed alongside edgy content a while back. Several rounds of this eventually brought about a TOS change where they could deem you &quot;not advertiser friendly&quot;. This of course ignored that Google does targeted advertising.<p>Some claim it is &quot;political&quot; however I believe it is simpler than that. It gave youtube an excuse to stop paying people without outright removing them from the platform which saves them a fair bit of money and doesn&#x27;t quite bring the same outrage from the respective fanbases as outright removing people. In addition to that the people that have been demonetised have ranged from progressives, anarcho-communists, people doing ben-shapiro compilation videos and edgy boys and girls that tend to shitpost. So I don&#x27;t see anything political about it.<p>They&#x27;ve also made it harder to be monetised on the platform generally, IIRC you can&#x27;t be monetised at all and cannot receive super chats if you have less than 1000 subscribers. You also can&#x27;t put custom thumbnails on your videos which makes it harder for your content to get attention.')
