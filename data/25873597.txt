But nothing higher than that. You would still need to implement the protocol in software for the most part. So at 133Mhz, it’s probably fast enough to toggle a CAN transceiver correctly, but would have very little comprehension of bus arbitration or CRC or what makes a message valid (RTR, IDE, DLC, etc).<p>It’s very cool, but the example they used of making a simple waveform for the serial driven LEDs is more what they were going for.<p>That example is pretty much already taken care of with an SPI or PWM that runs off DMA though. You can easily make a waveform for those LEDs. I’ve never understood why the enthusiasts use bit banging and special hardware.')
