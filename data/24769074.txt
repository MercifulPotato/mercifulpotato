It&#x27;s insane that Apple makes screens too big to use with one hand <i>AND</i> puts important controls like the back button at the top of the screen. Like you were saying, it&#x27;s really frustrating that the reachability gesture triggers things in apps--e.g., Twitter&#x27;s navigation menu completely overlaps with the reachability gesture area, so you can virtually never hit the &quot;back&quot; button because the reachability gesture will reliably send you to Twitter&#x27;s &quot;search&quot; page.')
