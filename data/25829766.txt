If it weren&#x27;t tech, then it&#x27;d be the ISPs, telcoms, etc. And don&#x27;t forget the ridiculous platform power of the banking, financial, and payments industry.

Trump and Co rolled out SESTA and FOSTA, along with several other content provider protections that make content like Parlor a liability for deeper platforms. Don&#x27;t for a second think that they were kicked off because the companies somehow objected to providing the service.
