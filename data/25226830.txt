As a manager, I would expect a &quot;productivity score&quot; to reflect the productivity of my employees. If someone has a low productivity what should I do? Of course I can provide training. I should also avoid raising his salary. And when I have to fire people, I will fire people with the lowest productivity.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a cynical or pessimist point of view. It is exactly what Microsoft is selling here.')
