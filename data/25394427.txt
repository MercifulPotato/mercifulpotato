Item(by='zucker42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607737551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25393657, text='The words &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;1st amendment&quot; are never used in the article. &quot;Free press&quot; is used only in passing. As far as I can tell, your mention of the 1st amendment is a complete non sequitur, and you are the only one doing the confusing.<p>The question is whether what YouTube is doing is good for society, and Matt Taibbi says no.  He&#x27;s criticizing YouTube for doing something he thinks is bad, since public criticism is sometimes effective at altering corporate actions. It&#x27;s pretty annoying that so many people try to sidestep this topic by saying that the first amendment does not prevent private censorship. Pretty much <i>everyone</i> agrees with that.<p>And denigrating people you disagree with is unnecessarily inflammatory.')
