Item(by='refurb', descendants=None, kids=[25099599], score=None, time=1605430645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099269, text='This is a pretty interesting list and I&#x27;m curious about some of the reasons for the differences.<p>How was housing handled in the former USSR states?  Were people residing in houses given an opportunity to purchase?  Or just given title?<p>I know in Singapore, most of the housing is developed by the gov&#x27;t (HDB) with assistance provided for home ownership.  Outside of that system, housing is ridiculously expensive.  New 1 bedrooms go for over $1M SGD, which is pricier than San Francisco.<p>The one oddity with Singapore housing is most of it is built on land owned by the gov&#x27;t and a 99-year lease.  Since Singapore only became it&#x27;s own country in 1963, some of those 99-year leases are getting to the point of having less than owner&#x27;s lifetime left.  From what I&#x27;ve read, the gov&#x27;t either allows the owner to purchase additional lease duration or the property is acquired by a developer looking to remove the old building and build a new one, with a new 99-year lease.')
