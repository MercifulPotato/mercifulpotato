It had interviews from all of the people that knew him during his lifetime.  This was long before his story was popularized by &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; and so I can&#x27;t find it now that there is so much other content.<p>Does anybody else remember it?  It was one of the good ones.  From what I remember, the &quot;asshole genius&quot; trope was greatly played up for the film and he was much more human than that even with the treatment he endured.')
