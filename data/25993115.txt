It helps _a lot_. You will likely hate the feeling they give you for the first week (you will genuinely feel high even on 10mg Adderall XR), along with nightmares and night sweats but after a few weeks, you&#x27;ll suddenly be productive at a very normal level.<p>I don&#x27;t feel strung out nor is it some addiction. Ignore the people screaming about Adderall being &quot;literal meth&quot; and how it will certainly kill you. Even with an addictive personality, it&#x27;s very easy to avoid over-doing it (hint: only take it as prescribed).<p>Medication is intended as a stop-gap to build a system so you won&#x27;t need high doses forever. If you go into thinking meds are all that needs to be done, you are going about it wrong. You need to build a system and reflect on how to improve your baseline productivity and keep yourself on rails (planners, calendars, checking your work, reviewing work with a fresh mind before sending out, etc).<p>Additionally, it does help if you like what you are doing. I&#x27;d imagine ADHD is much easier to maintain if you are self-employed or have a large leeway to define how work gets done or what work gets done. If you are in a command-and-control &#x2F; top-down power structure, you need to leave; you&#x27;ll never thrive there and will ultimately get tossed out.<p>Lastly, caffeine does help from my testing, especially caffeine combined with L-Theanine. I used to take 100mg of HVMN &quot;Sprint&quot; pills as a test whether I had ADHD; it helped quite a bit. It didn&#x27;t make me jittery and it let me focus much better.')
