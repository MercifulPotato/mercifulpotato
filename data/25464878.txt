[1]<p>You’re mixing up Safari and WebKit.  This gives a misleading impression.  Safari is Apple’s web browser.  WebKit is Apple’s rendering engine.  There’s much more to a browser than its rendering engine.  Apple requires browsers to use WebKit, not Safari.  Everything else – add-ons, syncing, UI, homepage, etc. – can be completely custom.<p>I’d be pretty pissed off if I were a developer working on a browser for iOS and everybody treated all of my hard work as if it were nothing.  Alternative browsers aren’t just reskinned Safari.  They are entire applications of their own.')
