Since (almost) all rust projects use cargo, it doesn&#x27;t have to fit&#x2F;work with any other styles. I think this position is close to untenable in the C++ ecosystem and for existing codebases therein, since it&#x27;s too much effort to port large dependencies and thus, it remains very hard to convince people to adopt it. But I&#x27;d love seeing something like this, since cargo is pretty much the best thing ever in this space IMHO.<p>The only way I can imagine this working is a very large vendor pushing it <i>hard</i> for their platform. This is effectively just Microsoft, all other platforms either use Java&#x2F;C#&#x2F;Swift&#x2F;JS&#x2F;... or are much more community driven.')
