This is the much more common type, and is a polymer matrix reinforced by carbon fibers. This is very strong and light, but not terribly heat-resistant. In a carbon-carbon composite, on the other hand, the plastic component is also replaced by graphite. This gives a very strong and heat-resistant, though somewhat more brittle, material.')
