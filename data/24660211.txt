No problem.<p>Nothing is wrong.<p>If you go with a default installation, and start building over there, for example a desktop system. This will remove everything else that depends on python (not only python).<p>And that, is probably wrong, as you do not expect to remove half of the system (and don&#x27;t reinstall it back), when you try to reinstall python, like megiddo said.<p>Some packages that do not need python at all, depend on python because of the packaging choices, like post&#x2F;pre install scripts written in python instead of shell.<p>Other packages that do not use python in their core functionality (for example a program written in C) depend on python because of add-on scripts or contributed extensions, shipped in the same package.<p>Unlike Debian, in the Ubuntu case this command is worse, because Canonical push hard for python.<p>Historically, many Debian packages depending on python, have been introduced or modified by maintainers&#x2F;developers working for Canonical.<p>To install a minimal Ubuntu server without python, first you need to remove many packages (a lot), related to launchpad, or landscape, or a few other Ubuntu specific services, or stuff really intended for desktop users (not for a minimal server).<p>Nothing against Python or Canonical... but as I have needed to deploy servers at work with the requirement of really really minimal base, I know well about removing Python in both Linux distributions.')
