I love it. I’ve been very very slowly using AWS as my “computer” more and more. S3 is a wonderfully cheap infinite hard drive and I never have to worry about migrating scripts. And EC2 is as flexible as computing gets. And since I need to recreate everything every time I boot up, reproducibility is a must, but that’s easy when you have it from the get go.<p>I kinda worry about the economical likely next steps of using a thin client like a raspberry pi, like everything will become netflix&#x2F;stadia and you never own the important bits.<p>But on the technical side it’s really great.')
