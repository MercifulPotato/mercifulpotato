If you already have someone in your family who&#x27;s making money and has benefits, driving it could be a fun way to make a few extra bucks and talk to a few people.<p>So if you&#x27;re a housewife with a few free hours while the kids are at school, or a bored retiree, by all means drive Uber&#x2F;work for this place.<p>If you&#x27;re someone in their prime and have to be self-reliant then this is as bad a deal as &quot;I&#x27;ll drive Uber for now&quot; as a life plan. You&#x27;re going to be down the road with no benefits, no growth, no title, and nothing to build the rest of your career on.')
