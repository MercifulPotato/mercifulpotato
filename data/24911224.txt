Item(by='burtonator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603829136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911176, text='&gt; The only thing stopping me from going all-in on paying for Polar and using it as the &quot;hub&quot; of my reading (mostly technical docs, long-form blogs, whitepapers, and textbooks) is the lack of tie-in with E Ink readers, which I vastly prefer for reading and note-taking over computer screens.<p>&gt; IMO, this is the killer final piece of the puzzle and would keep my reading and note-taking in one wonderfully organized place, which is something I&#x27;m 100% interested in paying for and supporting.<p>The plan here is to support tablets (Surface, iPad, etc) <i>very</i> well and have very tight integration.<p>Stay tuned ;)')
