Like, you genuinely feel like you&#x27;re becoming friends throughout the missions.<p>I also thought Johnny was a really well executed.  He really made me feel like some asshole is taking over my brain, and you slowly develop a bit of empathy with him and you can feel that he&#x27;s doing the same with you.<p>Plus, the scene where you play a gig as Johnny is so awesome.  I&#x27;ve never played a first person game where something like that was done.  Looking out on that crowd of people, I really felt like a rockstar.<p>Yeah, the side missions were filler.  And every NCPD job was identical.  But they didn&#x27;t feel any worse than Spiderman, and much better than FF7R (the cats...).  You didn&#x27;t even have to do any of them anyway.  It was just something to occupy you if you wanted to run around and explore the city.')
