How many threats were stopped due to police&#x2F;Three-Letter-Agencies being able to tap into the largest services vs going to the deep web and infiltrating&#x2F;investigating the group &quot;in person&quot;?<p>In any case, my feeling is that all these regulations do is push privacy-conscious people into running their own infra. I was even on the point of running my own email, Matrix and even a SIP server at home, but then I realized that whoever I will be communicating with would not be doing the same so the whole thing is at best an exercise in my sysadmin skills.')
