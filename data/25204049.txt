After I activated my pi-hole it went completely useless. The other day I was suggested Japanese motorcycle drifting.<p>I wrote my masters around the YouTube algorithm and the implications on politics. Some of my findings:\n- The algorithm works differently in English or other languages;\n- The number of views is not a very important metric on the recommendations\n- The number of interactions is a much more important metric for the algorithm\n- The algorithm seems to be fairly simple: the more a video has the searched keyword, the better chance you have for it to rank higher\n- YouTube doesn&#x27;t necessarily put you on a &quot;bubble&quot; as defended by some authors on other social media platforms. It suggests videos that are related but if no other videos are relevant, it has no issues with suggesting content that is contrary to the initial. An example would be: &quot;Donald Trump speaks about the elections&quot;. If no other Donald Trump content is available, it will suggest content about the elections, and this might mean a video about an opponent')
