While you may not find it true for you, for the non professional Gimp is generally good enough. Also  the Mac version of Photoshop while having some kinks even for professional use is pretty comparable, you don&#x27;t need Windows given you are already using a macOS.<p>- Enterprise Architect: If your argument is nobody is investing in Linux desktop modelling apps it can be argued nobody is investing in desktop modelling apps today period whether in Windows or Linux or Mac .<p>Modelling applications on the web&#x2F;mobile like Miro(just raised $100M+) or draw.io or many others have gained a lot of traction. Sharing and collaborating on the model has <i>lot more</i> value than <i>few</i> advanced features, Yes today Enterprise Architect has more features, however that is not going to last and these apps have a <i>lot</i> of functionality already that average users will not find them lacking even today.<p>- MS Office: Sharepoint&#x2F;o365 is almost as good as desktop office for <i>most common use cases</i> and getting better lot faster than upgrades to Excel. Yes Excel is used for those million row sheets with gazillion circular dependent formulas, and it works pretty darn well for all that people throw at it.  Sharepoint is improving, the use cases it is poor at handling will become smaller and smaller that procurement departments will start questioning desktop license budgets for Office apps.<p>On the whole barring some exceptions like gaming, graphics etc there are only few new active investments for desktop apps that are not just electron apps of web.<p>OS is becoming irrelevant for productivity apps outside of these sectors and legacy reasons.  It is not big tech does not know that, Apple is dropping dual boot in the next gen chip and it is not like windows or linux cannot support ARM, the pace of OS development has slowed considerably, Windows is only do to incremental updates to 10, the cost and effort of doing a major release is no longer worth the returns.')
