Item(by='thismodernlife', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610711909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogline.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogline.co</a><p>From the home page:\n&quot;Blogline is a simple, fast, personal writing and blogging app. Publish articles, blog posts or write private thoughts. Share with the world or just family and friends. Write from anywhere, on any device.&quot; (yes, it needs work!)<p>I wrote this during the first lockdown mainly because I wanted to write some fresh code in the evenings, but also because I was dissatisfied with Wordpress, Tumblr, Posthaven and static sites, having tried all of them over the years for my blogs. It&#x27;s built with Rails 6.1. Probably not much demand for this but I&#x27;ve enjoyed writing it and I run a few blogs with it.<p>Beta is pretty much done but I still need to put up a pricing page and connect to Stripe so it&#x27;s invite only right now (but I can provide invite codes via email as per home page).')
