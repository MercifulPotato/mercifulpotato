It was a nice new feature, although it wasn’t exactly the scope of the project. At that time I thought it would be better to accept the PR since the contributor put some efforts into it, and it would have been rude (or so I thought) to say no.<p>Four years later, I’d say 50% of the burden on that project is due to the feature that PR introduced. I often think about that time, and during these four years I’ve learnt to say no to PRs, mostly after seeing more-experienced open-source leaders doing so.<p>The key aspect is maintainance: contributors come with a feature, they add it to your project, and then the maintenance burden is on you forever. Too much maintainance means you burn out, and the project is dead.<p>It’s important to keep that in mind when deciding to accept or refuse a PR. To avoid misunderstandings and angry people, you should be as neutral as possible: is it a good addition on the long terme? How much maintenance cost does it add? Will it make the project easier&#x2F;harder to evolve?')
