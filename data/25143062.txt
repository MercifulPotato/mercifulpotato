The point they are making is that if the author wants to live in India, if the work is entirely remote anyways, they shouldn&#x27;t have to provide additional value.<p>If his work was worth $100K when he lived in SF, why isn&#x27;t the equivalent work worth $100K in Wichita?<p>To me it seems like a recognition of the fact that for remote work, location doesn&#x27;t really matter, so the market rate is national or global. If Starbucks wants to hire, they can base their pay rate on the local labor market, but software companies should expect to pay a national rate for those types of jobs going forward if remote work is going to be more of a standard.')
