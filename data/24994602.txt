Of course, the argument here is about the precautionary principle. But the precautionary principle sort of assumes that we can correctly judge which actions have potentially disastrous (non-ergodic, to use Taleb&#x27;s vocab) consequences. That in itself is an inexact science. Maybe these mosquitos are about to naturally cultivate some horrifying virus, and it&#x27;s actually not genetically modifying them that would be catastrophic.<p>Taleb&#x27;s ilk tend to respond with a kind of Chesterton&#x27;s fence conservatism: things we haven&#x27;t yet done, haven&#x27;t wiped us out, so lets not do too much new stuff. But that&#x27;s an anthropic argument, with weird Bayesian properties.')
