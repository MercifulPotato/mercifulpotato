The reason N=1 isn’t science is there is no way to isolate what’s going on.<p>If nothing else time is a factor which is always increasing for such cases and may represent the bodies ability to heal over time. The classic advice of <i>take two Aspirin and call me in the morning</i> is really equivalent to just wait a day, and you could substitute pray for an hour before bed.  So, “shockingly”, if the advice is pray for an hour before bed it’s going to seemingly work for most things especially if told to repeat it and just pray harder.  Except, again they could have said sing the national anthem before bed and that’s also effective as is doing most non strenuous activities.<p>This is generally true if what’s being suggested has other effects achievable in other ways.  If losing weight is beneficial then fasting will seem really helpful though other options for weight loss exist, those where not tested because again N=1.')
