Absolutely awful on both counts! That said, Apple already has mass adoption, and dealing with those UI inconveniences is considered acceptable in exchange for the OSes they provide (by their users - just look at how so many of them vote with their wallets). If Apple.com were a popular website, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;d be in trouble, but their real money comes from their (non-web-frontend) software.<p>That said, you can have a &quot;modern&quot; UI (although not UX) from SourceHut with <i>only</i> CSS changes. You can write all the CSS needed for a modern UI without doing it wrong like Apple did, and (if you know what you&#x27;re doing) without adding megabytes of bloat. Add caching to the mix, and SourceHut would be just as fast but look more modern.')
