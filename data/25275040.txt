There are good startups (especially in Milano), but I think the majority of the companies are still with an oldschool mindset, so that might not be too attractive. I know of a lot of companies that I would be glad to work for, with agile mindset, nice culture and good technology stacks, but they are maybe 5% or less of the all the software companies.<p>I have learned Elixir about four years ago, coming from Ruby, and haven&#x27;t looked back since. Of course, when the domain or the nature of the problem at hand requires different technologies, I use other stuff (python, c, go, etc.), but for most of the  stuff I work on, I find Elixir to be a great fit. I don&#x27;t want to go in too much detail, but if you&#x27;re considering learning Elixir to find a job, you won&#x27;t have trouble finding jobs, but other languages might get you there faster and open more doors. If you want to learn a new technology that will influence the way you develop and think, and show you a whole new way of solving some problems (I can&#x27;t stand concurrency in any other language after working in elixir&#x2F;erlang) I think Elixir is a great choice.')
