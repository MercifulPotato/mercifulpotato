Item(by='bane', descendants=None, kids=[24949767], score=None, time=1604115163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947498, text='I don&#x27;t have extreme physical pain, but I do have chronic pain in the form of a constant, low-to-medium grade headache that sometimes turns into a crippling migraine-like pain for a few days. It flares with weather changes and stress, but on a 1-10 pain scale it&#x27;s a 3-4 every day of the week 24&#x2F;7. At times it surges to a 7-10. There is nothing modern medicine can do for me but turn my consciousness off -- which I refuse to accept.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to tune it out, but the fatigue it creates is sometimes overwhelming and I find myself crashing frequently on whatever surface I can find to rest on. I struggle mightily in the mornings to make it to work.<p>When I was in my teens I was part of an NIH study into chronic headaches, but doctors in general waive it away or don&#x27;t know what to do about it. Constant back and neck stretches and 800mg of Ibuprofen daily seem to be the only things that alleviate it somewhat, bringing the average from a 4 out of 10 to a 3 out of 10.<p>Strangely, the first time I went headache free in my adult life was a week-long period in the Bay Area when I was interviewing for a few jobs. The headaches went away for a few glorious days I felt what it felt like to be &quot;me&quot;, unencumbered by chronic pain for the first time in my adult life. It was absolutely glorious. I sometimes wakeup, in soaked sheets, sweating about the bizarreness of dreaming about that week. I once had a root canal without anesthetic, because it wouldn&#x27;t take effect -- tuned it out -- I have nightmares still from the experience.<p>But I didn&#x27;t get the jobs, I live on the East Coast, and despite a strange semi-immunity to anesthetic, probably a result of the same condition and genetics (I can get a cavity filled by using the same &quot;tune it out&quot; mental skills I learned dealing with absolutely disabling head pain) without fighting over if the anesthetic is working or not. Most dentists have no idea why the novocain isn&#x27;t working.<p>My mother has an unspecified autoimmune disease that causes her global minor joint pain. Whatever she has, I&#x27;m sure I inherited it. Medical practitioners are universally unable to do anything at all about it. I sometimes drink too much so I can sleep once or twice a week despite (to spite) the pain.<p>It sucks and I hate it and I wish I had gotten those jobs in SV even if it meant I had one week a year, pain free. But now COVID-19 so....')
