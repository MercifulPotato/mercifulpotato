I’ve seen stuff that was classified Confidential, but also in a code word protected compartment. I had a TS&#x2F;SCI&#x2F;SI&#x2F;CT&#x2F;NATO&#x2F;ATOMAL clearance when I worked for the Defense Information Systems Agency in the Pentagon. Many times over the past 25+ years I have had to correct people who think the compartmented stuff is classified at a level “above Top Secret”, when in fact the compartments just cut horizontally across the hierarchy.<p>Below Confidential exist other “unclassified” states, like “For Official Use Only” and “No Foreign” (a.k.a., NOFORN).  Then, regardless of the classification, you should also have to prove “Need to Know”.')
