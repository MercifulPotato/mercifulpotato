On average I think I&#x27;ve finished maybe ten or twenty books a year, by reading them on my work commute. I&#x27;m lucky to live somewhere this is possible and comfortable. Some books I&#x27;ve finished on vacation trips, but basically almost none at home, except in the two or three last years.')
