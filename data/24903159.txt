The limits are cultural and ruled by law. In France, the freedom of speech must respect individuals and allows to mock ideas and ideologies. And religions are ideologies.<p>If people feel offended when their ideas are criticized or mocked, they are not supposed to kill: they have to adapt, or if in doubt they are personally attacked, they can address a tribunal to settle the case.<p>Liking a murder is not an opinion or a speech, it is personally attacking the victim and his relatives.<p>&quot;Clearly Islam, if followed to the letter, is incompatible with the modern world (...) Hell, nor is Christianity, if taken literally.&quot;<p>Not sure about this: all religions have specificities and different reference texts. Of course christians and muslims are humans, and humans kill when reaching extreme conditions. However christians are in violation of their texts when killing.<p>Not in Islam: muslims are in line with their prophet life (hadith &quot;who leaves the Religion, kill him!&quot;) and Koran, a book written by God himself. Koran is quite a bloody book describing severe rules, xenophobia for non-muslims, slaughters, slavery, explicitly allowing wife-beating...\nAnd being written by God, not a word can be challenged by moderates to stop extremists: they would just put themselves in the blasphemy list for being murdered.<p>Some muslims try to unlock Islam from these deadlocks. However it usually brings them to harsh times, a lifetime in jail in the best case (Raif Badawi), or being murdered (Mahmoud Mohammed Taha).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mahmoud_Mohammed_Taha" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mahmoud_Mohammed_Taha</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raif_Badawi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raif_Badawi</a>')
