But imagine an alternate universe where the equivalent term &quot;screen time&quot; also included origami for some reason. The study would reach almost exactly the same conclusions, because such a small fraction of people engage in origami relative to binge TV watching. That doesn&#x27;t mean that origami is actually as unhealthy as binge TV watching. The map is not the territory.')
