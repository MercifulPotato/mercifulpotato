Before docker, you&#x27;d have to create a new VM from time to time because the build agent had rotted away or died in an altercation with a bad build.<p>Docker in Docker in CI is like a lock on a door. It keeps honest people from being naughty, and is fairly efficient about it.<p>I don&#x27;t think the question is &quot;should I run CI in docker in docker,&quot; it&#x27;s <i>whose</i> CI should I run in docker in docker. Me in my coworkers can share docker images. Customers or freeloaders cannot. So if that&#x27;s in your problem domain, then you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s a bad idea. But it isn&#x27;t for most people.')
