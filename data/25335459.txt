Communication&#x2F;synchronization overhead is usually growing faster than linear in the number of threads.<p>I agree for sure. But the tradeoffs are pretty steep. Scaling within a core is traditionally sqrt(size), while scaling number of cores on a problem is also sqrt(cores).<p>Balancing between size-of-core vs number-of-cores is a big question. And that also depends very strongly on the task at hand. Web-servers scale better than sqrt(#cores), because each worker-thread is basically fully independent.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see Intel and AMD increase the width of their cores so much; they need their cores to scale to 5Ghz (even if it takes 1KW of cooling) for marketting and competition reasons, and wider cores are harder to clock so high.<p>I think there&#x27;s a good argument that AMD &#x2F; Intel can&#x27;t scale their decoder much larger than 4-way &#x2F; 6-way with uOp cache, due to the instruction set issue.<p>But I&#x27;ve seen some interesting innovations: the most recent Intel Atoms have double-decoders (2+2 decoder) on SMT-based Atoms. Such a thing would make SMT more efficient without much increase to power.<p>Its strange to see Apple take the single-thread performance crown. But... I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve proven themselves in the high-end server &#x2F; workstation market yet. Even if they do scale up, their decisions don&#x27;t seem to be an obvious winner at the high end.')
