Obviously, it wasn&#x27;t Russia - but equally obviously, the whole euro-skepticism thing was hardly an organic phenomenon. I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a single issue of a right wing British tabloid published in the last ten years that didn&#x27;t have at least one article in it about how bad the EU is.<p>Influencing democracy is older than democracy - I think the thing that&#x27;s causing such a furore is that the internet is lowering the barriers for this kind of yellow-press skulduggery, to the point that losers like Steve Bannon start to have actual power.')
