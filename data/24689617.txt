The difficulty is that as we learn more, we often (not always) tend to believe that we have most of the answers and become less open to other possibilities with respect to God or simply more understanding.  We have to keep in mind how much of our current knowledge has been acquired in perhaps the last one or two hundred years.  In other words, we are probably complete neophytes with respect to our understanding of the universe as a whole.  As a result we have to resist our more arrogant tendencies and try to keep an open mind to things that we may not yet be able to sense or measure.  As scientists, I think we have to recognize that God may not exist, but we must also recognize that it may exist, keeping in mind that our definition of &quot;God&quot; is probably way off base from what we might eventually come to recognize.')
