But that is true. Which is why browsers should expand support for authentication to provide things like public key authentication, credentials&#x2F;personas storage, etc. At the very least, an API to store auth tokens (and just auth tokens). Better yet, a standard login UI for logging into any given website. Even better, public key auth so that instead of logging in by typing in a username and password, you would select which persona you use from a drop down and passwords aren’t a thing. Of course that would require a robust and secure mechanism for syncing the personas&#x2F;keychains across different devices and browsers.')
