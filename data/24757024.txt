Of course he would think that, because if they were openly gay they would be jailed.<p>Sure, it forces the people that deny holocausts into hiding instead of eliminating their belief, but that&#x27;s also not the intention of those measures. The goal is that they can not openly spread those beliefs and create more holocaust deniers in an uncontrollable fashion.<p>Iran&#x27;s leader has the same idea regarding gay people, just that it&#x27;s a stupid idea, because contrary to holocaust denial, being gay is not a chosen belief (though in their mind they might think it is).')
