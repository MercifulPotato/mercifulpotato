Wisconsin is now the poorest state in the upper midwest. No one told our corrupt politicians that yes you can do boondoggles, but you shouldn&#x27;t do rich man boondoggles. We&#x27;re not rich, and we tried to play like a big shot state, and sit at the high stakes table. Well, now the bill is becoming clear, we&#x27;re out about $1 billion so far, and people are starting to complain. The time to complain was when we first saw, now ex-, governor Walker go sit down at the big shot table. We should have snatched him back right at that point. We let him make a horrible deal, rife with corrupt payouts to his cronies, on our behalf. That was dumb of us.<p>It&#x27;s a lesson for other poor states. If you&#x27;re poor, you&#x27;re probably corrupt, but come Hell or high water, you cannot allow your corrupt politicians to get you in too deep. It&#x27;s your taxes that will end up paying both the bills they incur, as well as the pensions they get when they leave office.')
