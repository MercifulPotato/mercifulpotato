In that extreme case, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful at all to claim that the gas particles are simulating conway&#x27;s game of life.<p>In an opposite extreme, you could say that the randomly moving particles in a gas are computing the motion of the random movements of particles in a gas. The interpretation algorithm is just &quot;look at the particles at time t. Their locations represent the particles&#x27; locations at time t.&quot;. It&#x27;s clear here that the system being interpreted is in fact doing all the computation and that nothing is hidden in the interpreter&#x27;s work.<p>One interesting way to try to differentiate these two cases is that if you want the results of a longer-running simulation, then in the latter case, you let the actual system run longer, and the work to interpret it doesn&#x27;t increase at all. In the former case, if you want to get the results of running conway&#x27;s game of life for 2000 steps instead of 1000 steps, then it doesn&#x27;t matter how long you let the gas particles go on for, but you do have to do more work on the interpreting side.')
