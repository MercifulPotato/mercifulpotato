Power improvements at the same performance are a bit better, but still not as drastic as people tend to treat it as.<p>10-20 years ago just having a better process node was a <i>massive</i> deal. These days it&#x27;s overwhelmingly CPU design &amp; architecture that dictate things like single-core performance. We&#x27;ve been &quot;stuck&quot; at the 3-5ghz range for something like half a decade now and TSMC has worse performance here than Intel&#x27;s existing 14nm. Still hasn&#x27;t been a single TSMC 7nm or 5nm part that hits that magical 5ghz mark reliably enough for marketing, for example. And that&#x27;s all process node performance is - clock speed. M1 only runs at 3.2ghz - you could build that on Intel&#x27;s 32nm without any issues. Power consumption would be a lot worse, but you could have had &quot;M1-like&quot; single-core performance way back in 2011 if you had a time machine to take back all the single-core CPU design lessons &amp; improvements, that is.')
