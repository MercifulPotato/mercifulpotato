They still construct sidewalks like they \ndid say 100 years ago.<p>So major software contractor&#x27;s success is pretty much random depending on who gets hired and how good the chosen packages are for the given application and how experienced are the staff in putting it together and having good test specs.<p>Another problem in software world is that software developers move to new IPOs   and so the staffs are ever more transient.  Government jobs with complex hiring practices are actually becoming unattractive to developers.')
