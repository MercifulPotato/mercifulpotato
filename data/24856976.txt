The problem is in all the grey areas between benign, reasonable, controversial, factually-incorrect, manipulative and then &quot;really bad&quot; content.<p>And the argument becomes even more moot when you consider that no one is &quot;forcing&quot; people to watch content that they don&#x27;t like, they simply ignore it and heck the platform can just hide content you ignore&#x2F;report. At that point, we&#x27;re conceding that we actually don&#x27;t want people to see certain content because of certain reasons.
