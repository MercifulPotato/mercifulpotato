Item(by='lwansbrough', descendants=None, kids=[25501348, 25500097], score=None, time=1608583955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498235, text='The answer is Core Web Vitals.<p>I have spent countless hours doing real optimizations on a website with real traffic, without submitting to AMP (which I view as a disgusting move by Google and everyone involved with it.) (Traffic which, by the way, does not reflect the device profiles of what Google considers the &quot;average&quot; user, based on real vs. lab results in Lighthouse -- which is forcing us to work on issues that are not proportionally relevant to our business, though I will concede it&#x27;s a positive improvement for us overall. But still an unwanted Google influence, like most SEO.. but moreso.)<p>Core Web Vitals should render AMP irrelevant, and thus seeing as both projects are being pushed by Google, it&#x27;s time Google takes AMP behind the barn. Unfortunately Core Web Vitals takes a pretty hard stance against bleeding edge technology like (Vue&#x2F;React) server side rendering with client hydration. Anything beyond a todo app starts to see considerable main thread time during hydration which obliterates the Core Web Vitals scores. I predict with continued focus on CWV we will see: much greater focus on startup times for client side apps (including better hydration strategies), and maybe even some server-side only JS front end frameworks -- more aligned with the JAMstack idea (everything old is new again, yay.)<p>As much grief as CWV has caused me, it is the correct solution to the problem of slow websites and its impending inclusion in Google&#x27;s page rankings should have a positive impact on the overall health of the web.<p>Why people who aren&#x27;t being paid by Google continue to defend AMP absolutely baffles me.')
