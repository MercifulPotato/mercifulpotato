I stopped contracting and took a full time job because of it... even small startups often get terrible options because they’re not at the size to have any negotiating leverage.<p>Without a universal solution we’re kind of in a state of light indentured servitude. If it weren’t for healthcare costs I might not even work full-time... I’ve considered moving to canada just so I can be free from the burden.<p>I don’t think most Americans understand the mental weight of having to think about insurance at critical life junctures... even if you’re willing to disregard the millions of uninsured lives that fall by the wayside.<p>I have to think about premiums, copays, billing codes, in and out of network coverage, have awkward pricing conversations with doctors, call to fight denied claims... and sometimes I still get blindsided if for some reason lab work needs a second set of eyes (sometimes those eyes are in the same facility and out of network). Oh and for some reason my teeth aren’t covered as healthcare?<p>We’re boiled frogs with this stuff... people still think we have the best healthcare in the world but disregard the fact that it’s only available for the rich; we’re generally well out of the top 10 otherwise. I grew up in a rural area and I know multiple people who literally pulled out their own teeth because they didn’t have dental insurance. We need to start taking better care of each other.')
