A large part of performance seems to be from the ability to gain an alliance with the patient, a component of which is empathy.<p>&gt;Being skillful at detaching from your own emotional response would seem to me to be a useful skill for such an occupation.<p>Possibly to some extent. Psych professionals often talk about &#x27;countertransference&#x27;, basically how the patient affected you emotionally, and how to use that clinically. If you didn&#x27;t feel anything, you might not be able to use this useful cue.<p>And one other mantra I keep hearing from the psychiatrists are, &quot;Find one thing you like about the patient and focus on that&quot; (especially in regards to hateful, angry patients) It&#x27;s going to be hard to help someone you can&#x27;t empathise with for being angry and build an alliance.<p>edit: Psychologist&#x2F;psychiatrist I flick between terms. I just mean any mental health professional that engage with a patient. Particularly for talk therapy.<p>edit edit: It&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s barred from being one. It just would be a big disadvantage (unless she deals with psychopaths who famously don&#x27;t respond to anything)')
