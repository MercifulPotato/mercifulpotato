Family plan, wife and I get our own accounts, works with Sonos (each of us separately logged into different Spotify accounts on the Sonos so it remembers our playlists!)<p>Now with Tesla adding spotify, I&#x27;ve got a 3rd user that is only used on the car, only problem is manually syncing playlists from one user to another, but you can &#x27;follow&#x27; another user now at least.<p>But, this podcasts business is madness. Their podcast integration has always been awful (you can&#x27;t auto-download new episodes for example), and now they&#x27;re shoveling millions into content I have less than 0 interest in.')
