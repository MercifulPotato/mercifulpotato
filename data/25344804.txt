The second two are definitely very different to Einstein on the Beach which feels more &quot;modern&quot; and experimental (but also really approachable - this is far from what many people expect of 20th Century avant-garde music)<p>Steve Reich seemed to want to also move towards more conventional narrative forms later in his career and seemed to sacrifice some of the elegance and purity to do so.<p>John Adams on the other hand came a generation later and those compromises always felt more natural and less forced for him.<p>(Terry Riley is the real maverick out of the original minimalists. He just does his own thing and damn everyone else. I had the pleasure of having a very brief chat with him after a concert and he was a lovely chap. I asked him about John Cale)')
