The original purpose of the research was to show that carmakers were capable of meeting more rigorous limits on emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides. The work was more complicated than expected, though, and Mr. Carder had to make up a $20,000 or $30,000 shortfall from other sources.<p>&gt; Over time, the researchers noticed that emissions from the vehicles — a Volkswagen Jetta and a Passat — were much higher than they should have been. But they attributed the discrepancies to technical defects or design flaws in the cars rather than deliberate wrongdoing.<p>&gt; Mr. Besch presented the team’s findings at an industry conference in San Diego in early 2014, still not realizing they had uncovered a scandal. The data piqued the interest of officials in the audience from the California Air Resources Board. CARB, as the agency is known, worked with the West Virginia group before and had let the team use state labs to calibrate equipment for the Volkswagen tests.<p>It sounds like they were just doing their jobs, they found it by accident, and the insight actually came from CARB.<p>This history behind this is interesting, it&#x27;s good they found it, and Dr. Thiruvengadam seems to be advancing in academia, so I think what recognition they got seems fair.')
