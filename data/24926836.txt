I have a short shell function (`ib foo`) that sets the badge to arbitrary text.  It&#x27;s NOT as good as setting the terminal theme, but it&#x27;s still very helpful to use it like this:<p><pre><code>    ib production &amp;&amp; ssh production-machine\n    ib demo &amp;&amp; ssh demo-machine\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s definitely helped me when testing a fix on a demo or staging instance, and has helped me avoid doing it on production accidentally.')
