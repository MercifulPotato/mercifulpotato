Any complication or inconvenience jeopardizes this goal. Something like picking a server, choosing an implementation, exchanging identities, setting up an account somewhere are all complications that people don&#x27;t normally want to think about. As it is, someone installs Signal from the play store, it becomes their default messenger, and they are done in a few taps.<p>I think the great success Signal has had is because of this mindset compared to the dozens of other projects.')
