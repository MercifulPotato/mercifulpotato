That&#x27;s sort of how IT has been run for a while now, but only half-hearted and in the worst way possible.<p>Almost every organization I&#x27;ve worked with has the policy of &quot;if you get malware, we wipe your whole machine and reinstall the gold image&quot; which is quite disruptive because you then have to reconfigure your settings and reinstall all your software packages and regenerate SSH keys etc. It can be a whole day of downtime and then a week of slowly getting back up and running full speed.<p>But if your hardware and local software are irrelevant, you can just swap your dumb terminal for another dumb terminal without skipping a beat. And with things like Chromebooks or iPads (actual real dumb terminals) the likelihood of getting to a &quot;wipe it and start over&quot; goes down a <i>lot</i> compared to machines running a full-fledged OS with a privileged user account.<p>If you drop your Chromebook in a lake, you could run to Best Buy and get a new one for $300 and you&#x27;ve only lost an hour or so, and if all your data is stored in OneDrive and your IDE is Codespaces you haven&#x27;t lost anything of real value.')
