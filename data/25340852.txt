It had a nice gas range that we were pleased was in the home.<p>When we moved in, we noticed this specific &quot;gas particulate&quot; smell throughout the house whenever we&#x27;d use the stove. It wasn&#x27;t leaking gas, but rather this smell I associated with dirty burning or something. The other times I&#x27;ve smelled it have been in propane space heaters for outdoors.<p>We replaced it with an induction range and have been completely happy with it. Heats amazingly fast, no burner to burn things, no emissions in the house, we love it. I never want to own another kind of range again.')
