Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602262005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731631, text='Certainly, SPARK&#x27;s GPLv3 license is incompatible with Curl&#x27;s license. Curl&#x27;s license is MIT-ish, but adds a prohibition for those who use it from using the author&#x27;s name to promote their business. That restriction is not compatible with GPLv3. Since the author of curl took the time to write that restriction, I would imagine it is more important to them than SPARK. Since the copyleft licenses are hostile to restricting free speech, it&#x27;s safe to assume that all copyleft options would be similarly unacceptable.<p>Rust is dual APL2&#x2F;MIT, and Curl&#x27;s modified MIT is compatible with MIT, so no such issue would exist for Rust.<p>(Standard disclaimer, I&#x27;m not your lawyer, no citations offered, seek legal counsel.)')
