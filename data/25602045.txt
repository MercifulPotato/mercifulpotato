So if it&#x27;s not impersonating anybody, and just orders food on your behalf with you knowing it&#x27;s a middleman, that would still violate the law, if I understood correctly. I think that wouldn&#x27;t normally be illegal because it&#x27;s not generally illegal to do things on others&#x27; behalf (there would need to be misrepresentation of some sort), so if they want to ban that they would need a law.<p>This is the entirety of the law, by the way:<p>&gt; <i>22599. A food delivery platform shall not arrange for the delivery of an order from a food facility without first obtaining an agreement with the food facility expressly authorizing the food delivery platform to take orders and deliver meals prepared by the food facility.</i>')
