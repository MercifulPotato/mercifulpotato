It&#x27;s been mundane stuff like just going in through the USB interface. If Apple eliminate the USB interface entirely, they&#x27;re still going to have to make it available by some other means to service&#x2F;update the device. Which means they&#x27;ll be adding that software stack to wifi&#x2F;bluetooth.<p>Your 2 attack scenarios are: device is in evidence lock up, and can b cracked at will (so a security company probably comes up with a kit for cracking and hooking them up, sells the service to LE) - or what happened with T2, where the software stack just gets exploited.<p>Since you&#x27;ll still need all those management interfaces that currently are only on the physical port to be <i>somewhere</i> - well I&#x27;d put money on removing the port actually making the device more vulnerable. Briefcase of GPUs to crack wifi and rootkit a phone if you can get on the same network.')
