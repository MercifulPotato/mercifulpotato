For example I made an app at a client. We could use RDS or we could use Dynamo. I went with Dynamo because it could fit our simple model. What’s more, it doesn’t get shut off nightly when the RDS systems do to save money. This means we can work work on it when people have to time shift due to events in the life like having to pick up the kids.')
