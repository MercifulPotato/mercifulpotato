For a clean room implementation you need at least two guys, one reverse engineer who writes down his findings and a guy who takes that information and reimplements the same functionality according to the information the reverse-engineer provides.<p>But you are right in that it uses the same algorithms, structures and control flow as the real Turbo Pascal and therefore should be bug-for-bug compatible but is written in Pascal instead of assembly.')
