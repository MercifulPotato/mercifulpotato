They are memorably terrific when ripe. Tarter than the Cavendish. With a softer fruit inside.<p>I feel we could grow more varietals of everything as American palettes expand. I&#x27;ve seen many types of chili peppers in farmer&#x27;s markets. And I&#x27;d put the taste test to Haitian mangos arriving here in early May with the best Alphonses the Indian Subcontinent has to offer ;)')
