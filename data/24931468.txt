Sure, take some to the death bed if you want, I think we should heartily defend the right to &quot;make the mistake&quot; of telling a secret to someone private and stand up for the horrible crime of seeking help in an isolating society. Nice name by the way, we don&#x27;t all have the memory of a goddess to properly order our secrets in.<p>____<p>Okay I&#x27;ve skimmed your HN history for juicy secrets to make a point. You&#x27;re a teenager who doesn&#x27;t trust people (with some parts of yourself) and writes your secret emotions down on paper to send to fake people. You think a public psychological label is a life-and-death matter. You seem to think &#x27;How to win friends &amp; influence people&#x27; is an acceptable instruction book for manipulating people. So you are somewhat exposed already.<p>The point of therapy is to not need it anymore. If you have hang ups about it, or other topics, you should go there until you don&#x27;t need to anymore. There is nothing inherently good or bad about having a socially approved and useful set of ideas to contain chaos.<p>The psychological disorders are like tools. They don&#x27;t describe what you are, they are a useful label for closing up Pandora&#x27;s box again and give people some relief from an unknown illness. Having a psychologist label you or anybody else as narcissistic, sociopathic or psychopathic is no more dangerous than being called a jay-walker. If you know what it means and what you are, then it&#x27;s manageable.<p>There are some secrets that will get your life messed up. For every Turing, you have a Tom Cruise or the people who went to Epstein&#x27;s island or whoever else has taboo secrets and still succeeds. There are not good or virtuous secrets and you are wise to be aware of their impact. The majority of secrets are uninteresting and commonplace.')
