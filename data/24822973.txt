You&#x27;re free to use it in ways that are sanctioned by that issuing company, but if you want to do something like spend it with a competitor, you might run into road-blocks.<p>In places like the US, this feels like an academic difference, but that&#x27;s because non-bank digital payments haven&#x27;t really consolidated yet.<p>In Kenya, where one mobile phone company (Safaricom) has a 98.8% market share of digital payments, the situation is very different- effectively on private company has a monopoly on money. They can and do use this monopoly power to their advantage.<p>A CBDC attempts to shift money back to being a public good like physical cash, by guaranteeing interoperability between issuers, rather than everyone paying with casino chips.')
