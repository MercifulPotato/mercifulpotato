Alignment of incentives is essential. People who live in wildfire prone areas should be required to hold adequate fire-related disaster insurance that the government will, on not, not spend money subsidizing their poor decision making. This may make it financially unviable for many of those people to remain in those places, which is good and an intended effect.<p>An interesting related example is Federal Deposit Insurance. The Great Depression made clear to the Federal government that deposits had to be insured against bank failure or nobody would ever trust banks to hold savings again and the banking system would never recover. So it introduced a mandatory insurance system that all banks would pay into to insure the deposits of any bank that failed.')
