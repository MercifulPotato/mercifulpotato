What if it&#x27;s actually good? Consensus does not infer virtue. Shall we suspend all laws?<p>The answer is that, while such an argument is technically true, we have yet to find a better way to structure society. Your example of Galileo <i>strongly</i> suggests that we should not hand over this sort of decision-making to princes or priests, which are the usual alternatives to the ballot box. The judgment of the majority is regularly wrong, but it is also the most regularly not-wrong thing we know about.<p>If you think the majority is wrong, convince them that they are wrong. It will take time. I&#x27;m sorry there isn&#x27;t a better way.')
