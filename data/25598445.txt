Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25598623], score=None, time=1609457145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598192, text='&gt;  I think the problem lies in the fact you would have to include in your business decision to block roaming.<p>Does roaming involve my cell phone having the same kind of unrestricted SS7 access on the telco&#x27;s network that enables spoofed robocalls? If so, what the hell are SIM cards for?<p>&gt; What does trusted mean? Does it mean that if someone on that network is abusing SS7, that they become untrusted?<p><i>Trusted</i> here would mean the network enforces ingress filtering on caller ID data; that calls being placed by end users on that network have accurate caller ID attached by the carrier, and calls coming in from another network either have trusted caller ID data or blank caller ID data.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about how SS7 works to know how what degree of access to SS7 is used by various methods of placing calls, but it seems pretty likely that ordinary landline and cellular phones are not viable ingress vectors for spoofed robocalls, and filtering is only needed with more advanced services such as connecting your PBX to the carrier&#x27;s network.')
