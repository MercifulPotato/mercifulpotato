No, the industrial might of the two-oceans-guarded U.S. and the raw manpower of the Soviet Union did, among other factors, such as the atomic bomb. The author is putting the cart before the horse by attributing the diversity as the distinction that delivered victory to the Allies. But it&#x27;s obviously in service of a rhetorical point, as inaccurate as it might have been- Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan was big on homogeneity and supremacy, and they lost; the U.S. is not, and we won.<p>Make a pedantic point, get pedantic replies. I think it&#x27;s arguable that the racial diversity of the modern U.S. was a natural outgrowth of the cultural&#x2F;ethnic diversity of WWII era U.S.; by then, this country was already a melting pot. So there is some truth, however garbled, to the article&#x27;s point. And it was a minor rhetorical observation in any case.')
