I don&#x27;t think anyone can complain about the raw compute performance of these cards.<p>Infrastructure: yeah. Without ROCm support, its hard to recommend. You still get Windows DirectCompute, OpenCL, and Vulkan compute. But ROCm is much easier to use than those other frameworks.<p>---------<p>For compute: With 40 WGP x 4 SIMDs per WGP x 32 Threads per WGP x Occupany 4, you&#x27;re probably aiming at 20,480 SIMD-threads if you&#x27;re going to be using compute on this card.<p>Occupancy 20 is supported: 20-threads per VALU, kinda like hyperthreading although you split your registers between the threads. 20 is probably too much (too few VALUs per thread), but 1 is too few (you&#x27;ll be waiting on VRAM latency). So 4 to 8 is an estimate for how much occupancy a typical program probably needs to hide memory latency.<p>Those 16GBs &#x2F; 20kiloThreads == 780kB per thread. Sooooo... yeah. RAM goes quick... really quick... on compute applications. Compute programmers really want more VRAM.')
