It&#x27;s very reminiscent of the VIC-20 and C64. A tinkerer&#x27;s computer. It&#x27;s really cool that products like that exist again today, and are so affordable. Almost anyone can buy this for their kid for Christmas!<p>I guess Python is the modern BASIC? I feel like what it&#x27;s missing is an easy to use graphics package for drawing lines, circles and other basic shapes (kind of like the JS canvas, but more oriented towards beginners). I wonder if there&#x27;s a pip package that does this well (and doesn&#x27;t require installing a bunch of dependencies)?<p>I&#x27;m also thinking this computer could be further made easier to use for beginners by having a kind of breakout board that plugs into the GPIO and has written labels, makes it easier to connect things (screw terminals?).')
