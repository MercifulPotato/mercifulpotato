Back then the indirect was the standard approach (in particular you wouldn&#x27;t want to waste registers). It requires just a bit more complicated reasoning, and the CS and the people in it were just a bit closer to math back then. Today it is basic engineering&#x2F;craft, and thus the standard is the much simpler for reasoning approach with simple pointers and the simple explicit special case handling - ie  our modern enterprise C code.')
