If so, DigitalOcean uses a heterogeneous mix of underlying hardware that has varying degrees of performance. Some of it is years old.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for normalized performance, it&#x27;s my strong suggestion you look at Droplets with dedicated resources. While I believe the disk virtualization layer is always technically &quot;over-committed&quot;, these Droplets run on more modern hardware that typically has better and more normalized performance.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to do that, an alternative strategy is just to destroy and recreate the general purpose Droplet to try and land on the better hardware by a stroke of luck...though that&#x27;s probably not worth it.<p>I hope this helps you!')
