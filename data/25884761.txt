Item(by='quasirandom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611426046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884101, text='&gt; The use of cell phone data is well understood, well litigated, and for all intents and purposes, settled law.<p>I don&#x27;t have strong views on the right policy outcome, but it is not accurate to call this issue well litigated and&#x2F;or settled law.<p>Just yesterday, NYTimes ran an article about DIA claiming a &quot;commercial availability&quot; exception to the only Supreme Court case addressing cell phone location data (Carpenter).  If that is indeed DIA&#x27;s rational, they are going to have some problems.  For example, it is unlawful for the state to use commercially available thermal optics to surveil the interior of a dwelling without a warrant. I think DIA may be relying on dicta from Kyllo about devices in &quot;common use&quot;, but their rational is secret so we won&#x27;t know until it is... litigated.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;dia-surveillance-data.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;dia-surveilla...</a>')
