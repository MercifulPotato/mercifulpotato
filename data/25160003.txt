If their behavior is anything like what I&#x27;m seeing in the U.S., they&#x27;re wearing it into the grocery store and going and seeing friends normally without a mask.  The fact the study still produced a (likely statistically insignificant) 15% reduction in risk (1.8&#x2F;2.1) is surprising under these circumstances.')
