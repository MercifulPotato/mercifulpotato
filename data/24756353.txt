They can make rules and enforcement as arbitrary any forum admin or subreddit mod. I think this is as it should.<p>No company should have authority over personal communication or public debate.<p>Facebook only has the power users hand over to them. IMO it&#x27;s clear that no company should be in the position that they are in. The answer isn&#x27;t solidifying Facebook&#x27;s role as central arbiter of free speech and regulate their role as moderator over public debate and private communication alike, but to transition to a state where the application, protocol, social graph and mode of communication aren&#x27;t coupled with moderation by a given entity.<p>Decentralize and federate.<p>There&#x27;s work to be done, but we need to fill the gap.')
