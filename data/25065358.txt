The compute might be more than Backblaze, but it&#x27;s predictable (the majority happens on upload) and it&#x27;s a tiny tiny fraction of the cost of daily search indexing, YouTube, etc.<p>The costly thing for Google is storage and bandwidth to the storage (since it&#x27;s hard to predict what can be kept cold-- but recognizing faces and objects can help).  And those costs, as we see, are a drop in the bucket for Google.  That&#x27;s why I conjecture this move is much more about marketing and company culture and less about real technical constraints.')
