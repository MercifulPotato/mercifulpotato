Having more options for placement of propeller (behind the rudder, for example, where a larger and slower propeller could be placed) is huge. NASA is also experimenting with many small propellers placed ahead of the wings which can result in higher efficiency at cruise, but unfortunately doing their most work when the plane is flying slowest (just before landing). We&#x27;ll see! But many exciting possibilities.')
