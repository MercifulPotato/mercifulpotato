[0] If you look at a lot of luminary careers, they also involve forever projects that happen to produce a digestible result. There&#x27;s an element of needing a bit of direction and structure so that you don&#x27;t go full &quot;mad scientist&quot; and lose your grounding.<p>For me, the actual forever project, if I had to put words to it, is something to do with studies in the   cybernetics of creativity, or in ELI5 terms: &quot;why is making games hard?&quot; It&#x27;s not really approachable just by making a slightly better tool, or a great tutorial, or a magic algorithm, or by organizing a great team for a single project - and the scope is multidisciplinary, making it less legible what I&#x27;m doing or why. But if I examine all my attempts there is an orbit to it that is gradually getting tighter.<p>With respect to examining low level issues in computing there&#x27;s a huge pull to engage in forever projects because everywhere you look, the solutions being built on are rough-and-ready ideas rushed into production decades ago and then examined only occasionally afterwards. My own efforts started getting sucked into the gravity well of &quot;perhaps I need to write a language, an operating system and a runtime environment to properly express this&quot; - I managed to climb out again recently by focusing on formats, data portability and conceptual specifications instead of concrete ones with actively maintained production code - it&#x27;s always the maintenance that is a killer and I can see that being an issue for Piet&#x27;s current strategy too. Our ability to conceptualize always outstrips the daily grind, but we need to have one to stay in that grounded mode.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24917834" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24917834</a>')
