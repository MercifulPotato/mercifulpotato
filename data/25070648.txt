Item(by='CydeWeys', descendants=None, kids=[25071085], score=None, time=1605193717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069644, text='<p><pre><code>    Women:                       +9 to +10% chance of callback relative to men\n    Black, Hispanic, and Asian:  -8 to -13% chance of callback relative to White people.\n</code></pre>\nI wish they had broken out the other ethnicities separately in the abstract.  The reasons that Black and Hispanic people might be getting fewer callbacks relative to whites are likely quite different from the reasons that Asian people might be getting fewer callbacks.<p>I&#x27;m making my way through the main paper but there&#x27;s a lot of tables in there that would take me a lot of reading to decipher and it&#x27;s really not clear which are best to use for any purpose.  The tables do break out the separate ethnicities separately though (along with callback&#x2F;interview&#x2F;offer rates, not just callback) and it does appear that Black, Hispanic, and Asian very much do not have the same experience.  In particular, the graph on page 22 seems to show that, when it comes to receiving offers, female candidates have a 29.5% advantage in receiving offers, Black 4%, -21% Asian, and -24% Hispanic.  The previous column (received interview) is much worse for Asian, Black, and Hispanic applicants though; all were significantly less likely to receive interviews than whites.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s lots of potentially good data in here, assuming you trust their methodology, but I personally feel like I need someone who knows this stuff better to write up a longer abstract based on all this data to really explain it to me properly.')
