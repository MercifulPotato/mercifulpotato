They were walked on before anything else. Then cars hijacked them, and now people have so long forgotten in the US that they&#x27;ve started writing laws to strengthen their land-grab as if it was always this way.<p>&gt; Should I be able to walk in front of a bus load of people and delay their commute?<p>No I don&#x27;t think you should be able to unreasonably obstruct the highway. You can&#x27;t do that no matter what vehicle or no vehicle you&#x27;re in. But crossing is completely reasonable in my mind.')
