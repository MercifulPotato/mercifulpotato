That fixed price becomes the upper bound and all private market participants would have to bid lower than this upper bound.<p>This doesn&#x27;t happen because those who have a political say don&#x27;t actually want more housing. My proposed idea would force the government to actually solve the problem after all. If there is not enough housing the government would be forced to build it as a last resort and if the government can&#x27;t do so because of the laws it has enacted then it can change those laws but that&#x27;s exactly what must be avoided at all costs if you were to ask existing homeowners.')
