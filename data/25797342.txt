I still use gmail but only because of inertia.  I could switch to some other provider but haven&#x27;t felt the need yet.<p>The hardest replacement for me is Maps.  Their search and traffic data always work for me.  They have a webapp and mobile app that are excellent.  I could do without the ads but recognize it&#x27;s the tradeoff for using their app.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried gets close to a replacement.  (I&#x27;ve heard good things about Apple Maps on iOS, but I have an android phone)')
