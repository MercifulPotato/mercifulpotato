A &quot;chink&quot; means &quot;a narrow opening or crack&quot;, and a chink in one&#x27;s armor means a weak point that makes you vulnerable to attack.<p>But &quot;chink&quot; is also an offensive term for a Chinese person, so &quot;chink in one&#x27;s armor&quot; can be misunderstood, especially if what you are talking about actually involves a Chinese person. ESPN got in trouble a couple of times with it, even though they had used it thousands of times before without incident, because of a couple articles where the weakness they were describing on some team was a player who was Chinese.')
