It makes creating a candidate drug to hit your target vastly easier. It doesn&#x27;t really make picking the right target in the first place any easier. The preclinical stage will be faster. The clinical stage is still necessary, and that&#x27;s the stage where the big bottlenecks (toxicity &amp; efficacy) happen.  There&#x27;s not yet a reliable toxicity model, and efficacy is even harder.<p>This will certainly help. But we shouldn&#x27;t expect drugs to be discovered in weeks instead of years, since the bit that usually takes a year or more (the clinical trials) isn&#x27;t changed here.')
