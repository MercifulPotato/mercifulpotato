I also never saw a kbps number.<p>There is potential I would have use for such a thing I guess. Although LIN works pretty well over 1wire and is built in to most UARTs now.<p>It makes me cautious when I read these things and don’t see specific talk about what hardware module is expected to do the work. Yea, they got two wire twisted pair distance, is that using a specific transceiver? Does that hook to a USART or CCP or SPI? It sounded async because of the longer bits as start of frame, but bit banging and capture&#x2F;compare kinda sucks.... IDK maybe it addresses this all and I missed it.<p>What I didn’t miss is he is selling a book at the end.')
