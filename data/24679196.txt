I once took a summer course in C++. It was so boring, made me never want to program. But then in high school, I learned to write programs on my TI-83+ that could do my math homework and confirm test answers. I got into web development, but back then there was no CSS yet, and I also thought that was incredibly boring. After graduating college, I went back to it with help from a friend who had some freelance clients. Today, I get a lot of enjoyment learning the latest technologies in web dev and UI, as well as back-end (Node.js) because every year new things are possible!')
