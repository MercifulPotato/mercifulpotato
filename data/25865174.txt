They didn&#x27;t do a good job of it at all. What they actually alleged (relevant towards this theory) was:<p>* There was set to a mass exodus of Twitter users to Parler<p>* AWS also hosts Twitter<p>... They didn&#x27;t even allege that AWS conspire with Twitter. Sure, they don&#x27;t have any evidence of that conspiracy without discovery, but they didn&#x27;t even allege a fact that could be proven with discovery.<p>These two facts are supposed to sustain the theory that AWS had no other reason to kick off Parler other than a conspiracy to keep Twitter the dominant platform. Despite the complaint itself opening up by alleging that AWS kicked off Parler because Parler espouses conservative views and later conceding that Parler knew that its content violated AWS&#x27;s terms, albeit Parler was attempting to rectify it.<p>There&#x27;s another issue with Parler&#x27;s claims that I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else bring up: if Parler was expecting the influx of Twitter users as a result of Twitter banning Trump, how would kicking off Parler keep these users on Twitter or otherwise buttress Twitter&#x27;s dominance?')
