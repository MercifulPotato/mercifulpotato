Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604352889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973441, text='When we clear forest or talk of devastation we tend to speak in terms of area.<p>The perimeter of a rectangle with the same area as a square is larger, so there is more edge for the surrounding forest to encroach upon at the same time.<p>The worst shape, from a &#x27;fill from the edges&#x27; standpoint, would be a circle. (Although I suspect that a square turns into a roughly circular hole within a few years, since the forest encroaches on the corners from two directions at once)')
