That is a mix of many people becoming less ideological in their licence choice overall as the F&#x2F;OSS developer base increased, and an increase in commercial interest in F&#x2F;OSS software that has lead to investment (dev &amp; other time &amp; resource, not just money) which has of course gone to less restrictive projects where such exist for obvious alignment-of-interests reasons.')
