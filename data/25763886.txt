It still stands out as one of the best systems I&#x27;ve seen although I&#x27;m not sure it would work on something like Reddit. It would probably work well here though.<p>I was active on kuro5hin around the same time and that had a story queue where anyone could submit stories and other users could approve, disapprove and suggest changes; when a story hit a positive or negative threshold of approves - disapproves it was posted or deleted, and if didn&#x27;t hit either within a week it was also removed. Again the thresholds were higher to get a story posted and to get it rejected, and only users with enough positive karma could see the queue at all. That worked pretty well.<p>In the early 2000s I was active on the &quot;hidden&quot; sids such as trolltalk where people would troll Slashdot and share it with others. At one point one poster ran a dictionary attack on the first 10k accounts using some very simple password guesses and captured several hundred or so - and then built a system that had them log into Slashdot regularly in such a way that they were most likely to receive moderation points, which were given to users who browsed regularly but not frequently. He then wrote an interface that wrapped Slashdot and allowed anyone using it to be able to moderate any comment there as if you had mod points, but actually by using moderation points from  one of the pool of accounts.<p>If you ever saw posts with (Score 30: Troll) on them, that would be why...')
