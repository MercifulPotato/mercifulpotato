Current thinking is it doesn&#x27;t impact the long term best estimate of longevity. We will probably resume the ever upward trend in lifespans after we&#x27;ve successfully managed this storm. But what to think of the 1-in-200 year shock scenario? Do we expect another pandemic in the next 200 years (:: Yes, return frequency of pandemics is about 20-30 years)? Is this the biggest we can face or are there even bigger shocks (Black Death-like scenarios)? How to account for differences in policy response (these models use data from many countries as a baseline) and expected future responses (will we learn something from this crisis). And then the kicker: How to model this rigourously enough to get your model past supervisors.')
