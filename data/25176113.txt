It&#x27;s only talking about whether someone &quot;can&quot; be a great player, not how hard it is (much much harder for someone short).<p>2. It ignores the fact that there are probably other genetic advantages that a short player has, and that &quot;make up&quot; for the height, but are still rare in combination.<p>3. Even with that, I highly doubt someone can be the greatest basketball player of all time while being relatively short. It&#x27;s just not possible today.<p>The situation with piano is the same, except it seems that, unlike in basketball, there&#x27;s actually something to be done about this.
