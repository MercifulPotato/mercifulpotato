Eg, if Orion is aimed at easy to use - i&#x27;m still not the target audience. But, i do write software that i want to allow users to sign. To encrypt their data at rest. To verify signatures.<p>Where would i learn what i need to use smart tools by other people? Where would i learn enough to decide how to choose solving my above problems with Orion vs GPG?<p>That&#x27;s been my biggest problem with crypto. I know enough to know to be wary, but not much beyond that. Choosing tools with that mindset is difficult. And so far, taking a crypto class is just teaching me fundamentals of building my own protocols - where as i just want to use existing tech, safely, and in the right situations.')
