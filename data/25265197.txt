Above a specific size you start doing that and don’t finish.  And if you can’t finish understanding it then it’s incomprehensible.<p>I mean you can take a cubic meter of granite and collect a lot of physical properties.  Convert the whole thing into a computer model based on those properties and you can build a simulation. But that’s glossing over the internal structure which in theory could be represented by ever more detailed models down to the atomic scale.<p>Granted, for everyday objects the incomprehensible nature of their internal structure is largely irrelevant, but don’t go so far as to suggest it doesn’t exist.')
