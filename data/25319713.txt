Though, playing devil&#x27;s advocate, I wonder if requiring propriety still manages to filter out the majority of bad actors.<p>I certainly see a decent number of commenters who are clearly rude and not making an effort to cover it, whose comments wouldn&#x27;t pass muster even if they weren&#x27;t rude, and getting modded away.  (There&#x27;s also some amount of rudeness that looks reasonable to the political tribe being rude, which generally remains in place; it&#x27;s hard to establish objective-seeming norms around this so I&#x27;ll set that aside.)  Lastly, I can think of only one recognizable commenter who I&#x27;m pretty sure was acting like a deliberate troll on a few occasions: starting out with what I&#x27;m pretty sure he knew was a straw man argument, and then using his rhetorical skill to just mess with the people arguing back, rather than making a coherent point.')
