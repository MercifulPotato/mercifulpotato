Devs commit changes to git, and either request a build or the build farm polls for commits and builds the latest commit on trusted hardware+toolchain.<p>A malicious attack could change the code but it would be detectable because git would preserve the malicious parts in the repo, and further tie a specific malicious binary to a particular commit making it easy to find the malicious code itself.<p>As long as not all developers are compromised then whoever is doing the code review would see the malicious code when they pull the branch to review it.')
