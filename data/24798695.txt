Which has 2 consequences:<p><pre><code>  1) patients no longer have any option at all to delete anything from their medical files. Corrections can be done, which sounds good until you realize what those are: short sentence or paragraph appended at the end of often 60+ page documents that practitioners have &lt;3 minutes to read.\n\n  2) they are by default accessible (and used) by any and all remotely medical personnel (including administrators and it&#x27;s been, for example, used for bill collection. Or, even more seriously, to forcibly admit people to psych wards, which in 2 cases led to the death of the patient)\n\n  3) they are by default accessible (and used) by police and the justice system and are used to convict people (you were the only one coming in with injuries right after someone died from a fight? Better have a good alibi ... and if you ever had any psychiatric treatment, even 50 years ago, it *will* be brought up by the public prosecutor every parking ticket you fight)\n</code></pre>\nI do not think AI or private enterprise, or some dark new form of government that&#x27;s about to conquer us is really the problem here.')
