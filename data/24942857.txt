Django already provides you the harness, and when you try to implement it yourself you will run into some gnarly technical problems. How do you make sure one test&#x27;s database changes are not seen by a different test? Are you going to run tests sequentially and reset the DB before every single one? Or are you going to try to wrap your requests in a transaction that can be rolled back afterwards? Any approach you take, you are reinventing what Django already does.')
