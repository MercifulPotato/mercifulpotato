Maybe it is useful.)</i><p>Maybe that&#x27;s a good reason to open for federation and now I wonder if it would be possible to have an user migration between servers without cooperation from the <i>origin</i> server. This would allow users to move to a new one without losing track of existing conversations.<p>Seems crazy, but the reason we can&#x27;t do this with email is the lack of a generally agreed identity for an user account that does not depend on the server itself. Signal accounts have a &quot;master&quot; key that can provide this and it&#x27;s only stored in the device and backups (it&#x27;s the most trusted of all keys, after all).<p>A sketch:<p>- User creates an initial account on server X (account: user@serverX.org), the procedure includes signing a message saying &quot;I use server X since $TIMESTAMP and this is the 1st server that I use&quot;;<p>- Everything works as now.<p>- User wants to change server, so they signs a new message &quot;I use server Y since $TIMESTAMP and this is the 2nd server that I use&quot; (account: user@serverY.org); this message is sent to all chats&#x2F;groups&#x2F;contacts and to the old server (as an information only, it may be already down or be non-cooperative). Contacts update the server part of the account and start sending messages through the new one. Maybe the user can still try to contact the old server for a while, for the event it delivers a message from a account that didn&#x27;t get the first, but at some moment all users will get the new address.<p>Notice: I have no idea of how this can work with sealed senders of other metadata-prevention measures that Signal uses and we all love.<p>Bonus: no more dependency on phone numbers.<p>Or if it goes to an more email-like architecture were users only speaks with their servers, it can adopt concepts from djb&#x27;s Internet Mail 2000 [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;im2000.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;im2000.html</a>]. This will *not* work for current email due to the need of keeping compatibility with the enormous existing user base, but this problem does not exist for a new protocol.')
