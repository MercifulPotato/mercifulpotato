However, people will vary widely in how much ancestry and genes they inherit from each ancestor, which will cause them to have very different genotypes and phenotypes.<p>This is illustrated in the 2003 simulation as follows: Considering the ancestral populations alive at 5000 BC, close to the ACA point, a modern day Japanese person will get 88.4% of his ancestry from Japan, and most of the remainder from China or Korea, with only 0.00049% traced to Norway; conversely, a modern-day Norwegian will get over 92% of his ancestry from Norway (or over 96% from Scandinavia) and only 0.00044% from Japan. Thus, even though the Norwegian and Japanese person share the same set of ancestors, these ancestors appear in their family tree in dramatically different proportions.<p>A Japanese person in 5000 BC with present-day descendants will likely appear trillions of times in a modern day Japanese person&#x27;s family tree, but might appear only one time in a Norwegian person&#x27;s family tree. A 5000 BC Norwegian person will similarly appear far more times in a typical Norwegian person&#x27;s family tree than he will appear in a Japanese person&#x27;s family tree.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Identical_ancestors_point" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Identical_ancestors_point</a>')
