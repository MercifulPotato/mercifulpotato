It&#x27;s more like these groups:<p>1. Uses whatsapp out of momentum.  Doesn&#x27;t want to use anything else, but might if people really push them; i.e. open to transition to group 2.<p>2. Will use whatever.  Some people in this group want to stop using whatsapp, but won&#x27;t break contacts to do so.  Some people in this group would prefer to stick with whatsapp to avoid the burden of a switch, but won&#x27;t break contacts to do so.  This is the vast majority of switchers.<p>3. Die hard whatsapp users. Simply refuse to switch to another app, because it&#x27;s a hassle, and&#x2F;or because they begrudge other people making a mountain out of a molehill and asking them to do anything. Might oppose yet-another-app; or might actually want to stick to whatsapp because they actually like the simplicity of the network effect.<p>4. Die hard non-whatsapp (likely signal?) users.  Refuse to use whatsapp, likely due to privacy concerns or distrust of facebook.<p>I don&#x27;t think most people trying to switch away from whatsapp are in 4.  Anecdotally, I people I know asking to switch are clearly in 2, and are largely losing to those in 3. Only 1 person I know claims to be in 4, but I&#x27;m not really sure that&#x27;ll stick if the exodus doesn&#x27;t keep momentum.  Because of the existance of the bulk of humanity which barely cares about this, and some of which will get annoyed at the suggestion - I suspect group 3 is much, much larger than 4, and that suggests this exodus will fall flat.  The only real chance here is that since this is all about closed groups that network effects aren&#x27;t so huge, so a considerable exodus without actual terminal velocity is possible.')
