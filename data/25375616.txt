It not really set up with the same kind of simplicity an Xbox or Playstation has as far as account tracking goes.<p>Its not really an excuse but I could see why there are problems to solve with it and they might have just deprioritized it.  You can still wipe and re-login and re-download but that&#x27;s a pain.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll add a guest mode or something.')
