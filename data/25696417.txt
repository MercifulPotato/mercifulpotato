I would like them to have less, which presumably happens either because (a) we stop using social media (at least in the current sense) and&#x2F;or (b) more options for &quot;social media&quot; platforms emerge.<p>Since (a) is unlikely in the near term, that probably means (b). I don&#x27;t how Twitter banning anyone (including POTUS) from their platform does anything but encourage that.<p>I also don&#x27;t see how &quot;large corporations that have used psychological manipulation and network effects to become really popular must be consider public utilities, despite no law to that effect&quot; really lines up with free speech.
