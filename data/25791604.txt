Since the advent of genome sequencing we can just go ahead and take a look!<p>E.g. yeast (your standard single-celled organism) posesses ~6000 genes of which ~23% (= 1380 genes) are similar in function to those of humans. Of those genes most of them have been severely mutated, on average sharing 32% sequence similarity, which is a world of difference in terms of protein functionality.<p>The few highly preserved genes that remain are core parts of all eucaryotic life (ribosomes, proteins for amino acid metabolism, etc.) and are some of the most studied genes (regarding cancer and in general).<p>Suggesting that there are some genes hiding in there and have been overlooked due to narrow-mindedness of the whole life science community is a bit naive.')
