You can have all private healthcare (capitalist), a public and private sector coexisting (mixed), or exclusively public provider (socialist).<p>And that&#x27;s just a sector. You can have socialist healthcare but capitalist manufacturing. Every economy is mixed, but it can balance to one side or the other.<p>(btw, all modern economies tend to be capitalist, but social democracies in Europe are definitely less capitalist than the US)')
