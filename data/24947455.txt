If anything there will be more arable land and more rain in much of the world. Additionally many crop plants grow faster with increased C02 (which is why marijuana grow ops put CO2 in the chambers of course). It also may be an opportunity to move off areas with depleted soils into virgin areas. At the time of the Cambrian explosion CO2 levels were ~20 times higher then they are or will be if we keep right on our trajectory. The earth didn&#x27;t melt down and life flourished.<p>And this is assuming much at all happens. I&#x27;ve been watching this issue for over 30 years and no longer believe they can predict with much accuracy at all. I was quite an alarmist in 1990 but not any more.<p>Imagine writing a program to model this. With the interrelated variables (more CO2 means plants grow faster which uptakes more CO2. More heat means more evaporation, more small cloud cover, which means less heat. Industrial output means more air particles etc etc), the flux and all the various unknown factors (what will the energy output from the sun be in 50 years?). You mess up one small thing or make a bad assumption and it blows up. I honestly don&#x27;t know how any rational person has much faith in the granular predictive power of this at all if they stop and think about it for a bit. Models are good to see how stuff works. Models at this scale to predict? Highly doubt it.<p>That being said, man does influence the climate to an extent it is clear. We should be cleaner. We should get off fossil fuels in an orderly fashion as they are filthy anyway. But, we don&#x27;t have &quot;12 years left to do something!&quot;. That is and always has been complete bullshit.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extinctionclock.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extinctionclock.org&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s most especially annoying to hear the latest iteration of projections based on tenuous models touted as &quot;fact&quot; and anyone who doesn&#x27;t believe is some kind of conspiracy theorist. The continual stream of failed predictions from the doom promoters is reason enough to be suspicious. The earth warms and cools. With or without us.<p>Finally, to all the 20 somethings turning red and mashing downvote right now, you will live long enough to see. In 30 years things will not be significantly different. Florida will still be there. There will be no mass climate migrations. The polar ice caps will still be there. There won&#x27;t be a huge increase in anomalous weather events. But there will probably still be a loud group of people proclaiming &quot;We only have 10 years to DO SOMETHING!&quot;.')
