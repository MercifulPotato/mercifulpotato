I have a friend who works in a medium-sized hospital system in the South, and we talked about using snorkelling masks back in May. (They were reusing one N95 mask for 10 days per person.) I was surprised no one had repurposed snorkelling masks yet.<p>I sent him the link. If he gets back to me and his hospital system is interested, perhaps we could arrange a call. Would your HN profile email be okay for reaching out?')
