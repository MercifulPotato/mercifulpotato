You&#x27;re doing it for no benefit to yourself and if you have a family, to the detriment of your family. If you don&#x27;t have a family and don&#x27;t want one, no one is getting hurt and I wouldn&#x27;t judge you for doing it (I myself spend way too long coding side projects but my wife kind of likes it as she also spends huge amounts of time on her equivalent activities), but life is short and we only get one shot at it... as long as we&#x27;re consciously choosing what is best to spend our time on and remembering those around us and not causing harm to them or ourselves, all is good.')
