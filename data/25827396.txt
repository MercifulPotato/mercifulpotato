If they needed symbols for propaganda purposes, they&#x27;d draw from legal symbol pools, like Roman culture. (It &quot;worked&quot; once...) More likely, they would draw from contemporary symbols that already had positive sentiment associated with them.<p>The point being, it&#x27;s not clear whether German speech laws are frosting or cake. If the German people wanted to destroy Europe and themselves, that would be enough whether they did it with the symbols of a defeated dictator or not. People point to European speech laws as examples of reasonable protections, but I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re stopping anything. The real bar against the collapse of liberal democracy is the fact that the people living in those countries don&#x27;t want it to happen, and understand why it would be bad for them.')
