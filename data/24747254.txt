Assuming your testing&#x2F;mocking library is reliable, this should be testing precisely what you intend to test. I guess it’s possible that your “more real” test relies on some hidden behavior, like how your real hash function utilizes system resources, which could affect production, but I don’t know that tests which are testing things you’re not even aware of is a great thing to advocate for.')
