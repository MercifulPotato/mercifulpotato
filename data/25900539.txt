But I think both yours and that post make valid points that don&#x27;t even contradict each other. Because even if we pressure people to do the right thing, after all, this is presumably a free country and there seem to be plenty of people (quickly scanning this thread for percentage quotes, dangerously close to ruining the presumed herd immunity level) who will refuse - or neglect - to comply. But what can really be done about this?<p>Pressuring in form of awareness efforts will take probably years, and who knows how many deniers will even get it. I&#x27;m starting to read posts and &quot;studies&quot; about paying people off, which I think is insane - (1) the whole idea of people who want to fix this problem actually having to bribe via their taxes those people who refuse to accept reality, and (2) payoffs can simply be abused in a million ways - but whatever, say we all take one for the greater good. But then even a large-scale payoff effort will also take months if not years.<p>What else can you do to pressure people? Restrict their rights until they get a shot? Tell them their kids can&#x27;t go to school until they show a QR proof of vaccine? Realistically, just how can you pressure people if you are not in North Korea? So then we&#x27;re back to everyone on lockdown because of the stubborn few?')
