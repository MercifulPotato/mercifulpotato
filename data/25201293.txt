If you buy in bulk large enough that they suspect you&#x27;re a seller, but don&#x27;t have any reports of you being a seller they&#x27;ll give you a love letter which is, &quot;We confiscated your package.  Don&#x27;t do it again.&quot; and that&#x27;s the max penalty for buying 4-aco in the US.  If a law is unenforced in the US, it is legal.  To prove it is enforced if they ever want to go after sellers, they have to capture multiple sellers at once in bulk to prove there is no bias.  The legal system is interesting in the US, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Also, where I live (Oakland) it&#x27;s totally outright legalized, so no problems.')
