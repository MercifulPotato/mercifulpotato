There is now mature tooling for keeping your dependencies &#x2F; libraries up-to-date automatically, using automatic migration-scripts (must be provided by the library author of course).<p>See here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scala-steward-org&#x2F;scala-steward&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;scalafix-migrations.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scala-steward-org&#x2F;scala-steward&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mast...</a><p>The difficult part here is of course to write the migrations. This works very well in Scala (and can work as well in certain other languages) because the type-system provides enough information to do automatic rewrites and it is easy to _not_ use unsound techniques such as reflection, code generation, macros etc.<p>The reason why we don&#x27;t see such tooling in other languages yet is that they are either dynamically typed, which makes it almost impossible to write migration scripts that pretty much always work. Or they are statically typed but the typesystem is so limited that developers have to fall back on mentioned unsound features.')
