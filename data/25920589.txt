Canadians have access to the TN visa, which is effectively automatic, while most other countries need an H-1B, which is lottery-based (last time I was in the lottery it was about a 1&#x2F;3 chance of getting it).<p>As a result, I think &quot;non-Canadians who came for their undergrad and now moving to wherever they get the best job&quot; is a smaller set of people than you&#x27;d think, simply because they&#x27;re held back by the (Byzantine) immigration system in the US.<p>Another related factor is that if you go to an American university for undergraduate CS rather than a Canadian one, you get the opportunity to use OPT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Optional_Practical_Training" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Optional_Practical_Training</a>), which gives you up to 36 months to roll for an H-1B visa. Add onto that the fact that there are so many good American CS universities to choose compared to Canadian ones, I&#x27;d expect most international students to study in the US versus at Waterloo if their goal was to work in California.')
