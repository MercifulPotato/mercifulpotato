The phrase &quot;parsing with derivatives&quot; (or &quot;Might&#x27;s &#x27;Parsing with Derivatives&#x27;&quot; as I wrote in my initial comment to which you first replied) refers specifically to the technique developed by Might et al that generalizes the Brzozowski derivative to CFGs. And, more to the point, their technique has <i>very</i> poor performance, which is addressed directly in the paper.<p>If you talk to parsing people about &quot;parsing with derivatives&quot;, they will undoubtedly assume that you specifically mean the Might et al work and not some other, more general notion, regardless of whether one could technically call such notion a &quot;parsing with derivatives&quot; technique. I have never heard of anybody calling anything else &quot;parsing with derivatives&quot; and, indeed, the paper you linked never uses this phrase (the closest they come is &quot;matching with derivatives&quot;, which is a bit different in semantics).<p>I appreciate the points you&#x27;ve raised, and I do think the RE-parsing paper you linked previously looks very interesting (I hadn&#x27;t seen it before), but the crux of the issue is that you misinterpreted what I said and haven&#x27;t yet acknowledged that misinterpretation. Instead, it feels like you&#x27;re trying to fight me on other points to win back some ground or something, though I hope I&#x27;m just misreading this because I find that kind of a frustrating conversational method.')
