I get the skepticism, though I should also point out...I didn&#x27;t post this topic on Hacker News.<p>So I never intended it to be here, just trying to answer some questions as I get that people from HN have way less context about me or the community than people who&#x27;ve been following the community and newsletter for 6 months on Twitter!<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s not meant as self-promotion. It&#x27;s part of my effort to &quot;build in public&quot;, as I mentioned in another comment.<p>My main takeaway in the article is actually that a lot of people skip the step of &quot;providing value first&quot; and jump to something paid.<p>Whereas I&#x27;ve been writing a free newsletter for 6+ months, which many people have actually offered to pay for and told me are &quot;better than most paid courses&quot;. I&#x27;ve done weeks worth of free consulting over email for subscribers and they have had \nreally cool successes.<p>Anyway, we do have a public events page if you want to see the kind of stuff going on: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloggingfordevs.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloggingfordevs.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;</a><p>As I mentioned at the end of the blog post, I&#x27;m personally preparing an SEO Workshop which&#x27;ll be given in less than two weeks. The membership is literally $12&#x2F;mo and refundable, and a workshop like that alone would cost 10-20x that if given in a conference setting.<p>Not sure if this is &quot;enough&quot; for people here, but as long as members who are there are happy and feel like their investment is compounding, that&#x27;s gonna have to be my metric for success.<p>Hope that contributes to the discussion.')
