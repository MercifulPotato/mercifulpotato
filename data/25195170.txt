Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606190654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194397, text='&gt; Convolution is mainly and primarily used as a convenient way to covert signals between time and frequency domain<p>Btw that isn&#x27;t true. That operation is called a &quot;transform&quot; as in &quot;Fourier transform&quot; and &quot;z-transform&quot;. The property of those transforms is that element-wise multiplication in one domain becomes convolution in the transformed domain. Element-wise multiplication in &quot;time&quot; domain is convolution in &quot;frequency&quot; domain and element-wise multiplication in &quot;frequency&quot; domain is convolution in &quot;time&quot; domain.')
