As an Asian American it is baffling how throughout years of propaganda, so many Americans firmly believe that personal freedom and democracy <i>cannot</i> co-exist with a competent and effective government that has all the tools and resources to do its job.<p>I think it comes from shallow interpretation of sayings such as &quot;power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;. I mean it&#x27;s a catchy saying, but in reality it&#x27;s just a result of terrible system engineering (in this case the government system) in many places.<p>It is totally possible to have a powerful government <i>and</i> have that government supervise. In the end there is a clear distinction between &quot;big government&quot; and &quot;authoritarian dictatorship&quot;. If your big government devolves into individual dictatorship it just mean the single executive position likely had too much power to begin with.<p>In fact, similar to companies, it&#x27;s very well possible to avoid a single dictator CEO even as your company grows large and end up with a large management hierarchy.')
