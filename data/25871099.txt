Hosting an SaaS version was possible back then, but it didn&#x27;t happen at the scale that it is, so it was more of a theoretical problem. Now it&#x27;s a very practical problem.<p>This is a bit of a simplistic take, and there seem to be a lot of side shows (like trademarks), so more details lurk in the shadows.<p>If I were to try to make a value judgement, my premise would be the flourishing OSS is a good thing. AWS&#x27;s actions have have driven Elastic to make their product no longer OSS, which is not good. OTOH they maintain an OSS fork, which is good.<p>But the interesting broader question is: would it have been beneficial for OSS if Amazon were paying some license fees to Elastic, for an OSS product? I think we need to find some model whereby OSS shops are not forced to rely on the whim of a giant to make their money. Whether this can be done sustainably without restricting usage rights remains to be seen, IMHO.')
