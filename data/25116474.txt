My point, which apparently I didn&#x27;t make very well, was that we accept some danger in order to avoid some limitations on liberty.  It is not a binary tradeoff.  We could choose to enforce those rules or make them more strict and save even more lives potentially, but we don&#x27;t.  Because society has decided to draw our line in a certain place on the liberty&#x2F;safety spectrum.  You and I and many others draw our lines in different places on this spectrum.  That&#x27;s fine.  I don&#x27;t dismiss other arguments against my position as being made by dumb, uninformed people.  We need to be careful to avoid judging all the sides by their &quot;worst&quot; proponents.')
