Is using reference material a bad thing?<p>Edit: \nI know the article touches on that idea briefly but my argument would be &quot;of course it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;.<p>Sure, I <i>could</i> develop slightly faster with a more encyclopedic memory but I really doubt it would make an observable difference in the long-term.<p>Most of my time isn&#x27;t spent referencing libraries or syntax but instead I spend most of my time thinking out the logic and higher level relationships of my code. I suspect that is largely the case of any development even remotely non-trivial.')
