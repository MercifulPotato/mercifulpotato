Stores buy their stock. They can choose to stock other brands or to make their own products, but they invariably have to purchase what they sell.<p>The Amazon market place makes you think it&#x27;s the same but it&#x27;s not. Sellers are using the platform to sell their own products and they pay Amazon for that service.<p>Amazon is accused of using sales data from the sellers, like their sales volumes, margins and customers profiles, and then undercut them by producing their own version. Amazon basically benefit from the traffic, interest and sales data of sellers to then displace them and promote their own product.<p>It&#x27;s like if you had a small business but your landlord had access to all your data and saw that they should also sell their own copies of your most profitable items by opening a bigger shop right next to you and selling for cheaper because being the landlord, they don&#x27;t need to pay rent.<p>Maybe illegal, maybe not, but in any case it&#x27;s cause for at least some amount of concern and deserves some overseeing.<p>It&#x27;s way too tempting to abuse that absolute power in some way, whether as a matter or policy or just because some overzealous Amazon manager found that pushing the envelope was in their own interest.<p>You can&#x27;t just ignore that and brush it off. We&#x27;ve created a potential bully and we should at least keep watch.')
