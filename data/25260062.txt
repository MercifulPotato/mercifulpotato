The &quot;meaning&quot; is to describe a mechanism in the host organism (by way of encoding a protein). That is a complex process which involves gene expression AND protein folding.<p>For example would you say that the &quot;meaning&quot; of some Java code is to generate bytecode? Of course not, the &quot;meaning&quot; is to run some algorithm on the computer that executes it')
