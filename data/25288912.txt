You would need to assign a specific faculty member to keep up with this person&#x27;s work, and continuously give them new assignments that are meaningful such that they still are learning new concepts from them. You&#x27;re asking someone to teach multiple years of various subjects just to accommodate one student. Generally, this is achieved through online learning where the student will be outside of a normal classroom working on online classes.<p>&gt;What is the rush to skip five years of social development?<p>People at this level of intelligence don&#x27;t relate to their peers and usually have trouble forming any meaningful connections &#x2F; making friends. They quite literally fit in better with more academically developed students in an environment that they can thrive in, and where their intelligence can be appreciated and utilized by professors.')
