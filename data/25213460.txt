Which is what you should compare M1 against, anyway.<p>How exactly do you compare an unreleased product to an actual shipping one? Do we go to the land of hypothetical benchmarks where you just make up numbers for the unshipped product?<p>&gt; And AMD does have high efficiency accelerated video decode on their laptop chips, and it also even supports 8K decoding, though it&#x27;s almost useless.<p>Please share some details on these AMD based $699 systems which can edit 8k video. No-one is claiming you can&#x27;t edit 8k video on other systems. The entire point is that you can do this on the cheapest system in Apple&#x27;s lineup.')
