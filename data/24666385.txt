Item(by='acituan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601668009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24665517, text='&gt; If a country has figured out how to provide for its people w&#x2F;o jobs, so what?<p>Except no country has done that yet. We are far from full automation and most of the structural unemployment is due to emerging differential between labor demand and existing labor supply, not because we are in a state to provide everyone everything they want.<p>Also I want you to consider that a <i>vocation</i> is not only about covering one&#x27;s needs, but also about <i>our need</i> to do something that matters for other people, with other people, to feel useful (vocation = calling). There is only so much need for every unemployed person doing arts and crafts, or another youtube channel to watch gadgets shredded in blenders or mentos put into a swimming pool full of coke. We deep down desire to do things that <i>really</i> matter, <i>really</i> meaningful.<p>&gt; &quot;Living with their parents&quot; - Again, so what?<p>There is &quot;living with parents because I value kin work and kin relationships&quot; and there is &quot;living with parents because I need to financially and psychologically&quot;. Meaningful participation in society requires having a degree of autonomy, individuation and agency. I would push even further; freedom from serious mental health problems, societally and individually, requires those. This is not an advocacy of hyperindividualism, it is about healthy ego-separation and self-actualization, which counter-intuitively also helps with social cohesion because it prevents <i>ressentiment</i>.')
