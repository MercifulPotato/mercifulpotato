I&#x27;m probably spoiled by all its features:<p>* Conditional Breakpoints.<p>* Move instruction pointer.<p>* Jump between threads, freeze and thaw them.<p>* Showing variable Values when hovering over them.<p>* Inspecting (large) Lists and Dictionaries easily.<p>* Changing variable values or execute methods while breaking.<p>* Changing code and continue debugging.<p>* Historical debugging (moving backward)<p>I believe that someone who never experience debugging like this cannot possibly imagine how much you could improve debugging in other environments.')
