And below that is the kernel and graphics driver which figures out <i>how</i> to do that and communicates it to the GPU. And below that is the actual GPU which figures out how to modulate an array of pixels into an HDMI signal. When do we stop quibbling about the size of binaries? Itâ€™s pointless to point out that small code relies on other abstractions. No one complains about tiny demo scene programs using tons of other stuff built into the OS. So why here?')
