Fortunately where I live mask wearing is not a political statement and therefore people use common sense and their brain to evaluate when and where to wear a mask and everything is very relaxed and fluid. When mask wearing becomes a political symbol then all logic is out of the window and you get crazy mental ideologists on both sides destroying it for everyone. We should make a list of all those people on both sides and maybe one day that list might become useful lol.')
