Moreover, how do you assume that your criticism or the songs you would like to have played somehow take priority over other peoples interests? If I would be in the audience for some unknown band I certainly hope that people who don&#x27;t like the music leave instead of heckling the musicians.<p>You are saying that maintainers have a &quot;social obligation&quot; by giving you something for free, so you are entitled to their time, because that&#x27;s what it boils down to. To make another analogy (again admittedly flawed), would I be entitled to demand you reply to me, because I have given you my attention in this discussion?')
