The first peak of the pandemic was 9 months ago, and we&#x27;re still not seeing re-infections rise, so there&#x27;s no reason to think this infection-based immunity is short-lived.<p>Obviously there might be long-term benefits to still vaccinating such people, but right now we&#x27;re dealing with a very limited resource. Giving the vaccine to someone who hasn&#x27;t been infected is a huge gain (say, 0% to 60% protection), while the second shot is a smaller gain (say, 60% to 90%), and someone who already has natural immunity is probably even smaller yet (say, 90% to 99%)<p>(Numbers are off-the-top-of-my-head and meant to indicate magnitude not an exact value)')
