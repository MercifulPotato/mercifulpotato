However, regarding your non-partisan voting argument, I can say - and that&#x27;s what I meant in my previous comments - that non-partisan voting was pronounced during previous congressional terms. Unfortunately, the current Congress, with some notable exceptions (like the ones you mentioned as well as the CARES Act), almost always votes across party lines~. Let&#x27;s see what happens in this regard after January 20th.<p>~) Also consider @Steltek&#x27;s point (comment below): <i>&quot;it&#x27;s hard for Senators to break ranks if bills are never brought to a vote&quot;</i>.')
