When we are stressed&#x2F;anxious&#x2F;afraid, the part of the brain called the <i>amygdala</i> activates our &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. So, when we try to take &#x27;big&#x27; steps, we activate the amygdala and...give up, run away, avoid. But (extremely) small steps &quot;sneak&quot; past the amygdala without activating the fight or flight response.')
