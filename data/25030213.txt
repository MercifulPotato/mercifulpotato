Item(by='kristoff_it', descendants=None, kids=[25030738], score=None, time=1604879818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029720, text='Hi that&#x27;s the newsletter I write and it&#x27;s not an official thing. That passage is based on my personal experience of watching other projects that I deem reputable (i.e. Jai, Handmade Hero) and doing the very basic thing of looking at how they are doing compared to us.<p>Jonathan Blow is a very smart individual, in a sense that goes way past his programming ability (as exemplified by the fact that 2 out of the 3 talks of his that I link to in the newsletter are not about programming), that said he has approached the development of Jai in a diametrically opposite way compared to what Zig is doing.<p>We have a full-fledged OSS project with contributors, PRs, etc; while JB, while IIRC he plans to open-source the code eventually, does development in private and even got to the point of refusing to showcase new features he&#x27;s adding because he doesn&#x27;t want other projects to copy him.<p>Clearly there is a philosophical disagreement there between Zig and Jai, but, as I said earlier, I really think Jai is a valid project and as such I&#x27;m not dismissive of those disagreements.<p>On our side of the argument we have a constantly increasing number of contributors, so the point I was making in the newsletter is that it really means something, because, at least according to my perception from watching JB&#x27;s streams, we&#x27;re moving at a faster speed.<p>I&#x27;ve personally learned a lot watching Casey and John stream themselves coding (Casey also started a youtube channel on legal cases, which is another very interesting watch), but they&#x27;re not perfect and in the specific case of developing in the open vs developing in a cave, I think I have a priviledged PoV where I can raise valid criticism.<p>Does everything we write on the internet have to be investor-friendly? Fuck I hope not.')
