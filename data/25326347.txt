Novi is just a wallet using DIEM, and will have its own users (like any wallet or bank or trading platform has).<p>That being said, there is a lot of work being put in making sure that FB doesn&#x27;t have access to Novi user data. Of course, sometimes one employee&#x27;s mistake can lead to infringement of a claim, so to avoid that good frameworks have to be put into place.')
