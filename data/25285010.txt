Specifically:<p>&gt; MCAS was devised to fulfill an airworthiness certification condition in 14 CFR 25.173 and 14 CFR 25.175. In high angle-of-attack (AoA) flight configuration, it is required that stick force&#x2F;g (the stick force necessary to produce (hold) an incremental normal acceleration of 1g) and stick movement&#x2F;g (ditto mutatis mutandis) must increase (or at least not decrease) with an increase in AoA (thanks to Clive Leyman for this formulation). I understand that in flight test, in which “wind-up turns” were conducted (a turn with increasing angle of bank; an increasing angle of bank means ceteris paribus increasing AoA), this condition was not fulfilled.<p>-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abnormaldistribution.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;ieee-spectrum-on-possible-software-involvement-in-two-recent-airliner-crashes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abnormaldistribution.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;ieee-s...</a>')
