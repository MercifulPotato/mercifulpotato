Cars, which have no legacy compatibility issues also use three phases. Three-phase power is a very good balance of simplicity of transformation and rectification with even-ness of loading.<p>You have to remember that alternators and generators are loading mechanical systems, so it&#x27;s a bad idea to have huge cyclic variations in the load, which stresses the physical system.')
