Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=[25413082], score=None, time=1607895978, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410558, text='&gt; If running a red light or stop sign is a $200 ticket in a car, it should be a $200 ticket on a bike.<p>Curiously; in France many red-lights are excepted for bicycles.  There&#x27;s often a special, permanent &quot;orange&quot; signal that applies to bikes, thus they are explicitly encouraged to run the red light.  If I understand well, this was in agreement with drivers, who were annoyed to wait for all the bikes to start slowly after the light turns green.<p>I think that if you ever try to use a bicycle in transit (I mean, seriously over a few days, not for 5 minutes), you will see that it is essentially impossible to do correctly.  Sometimes you have to turn left across many lanes of fast cars, what are you supposed to do?  Inevitably you take the least dangerous path.')
