I finally realized that when I imagined our modern consumption as a pipeline:<p><pre><code>       PRODUCTION    CONSUMPTION\n  RAW =====*=============*=========&gt; LANDFILL\n  MATERIALS\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s our economy in a nutshell: an exponentially growing process that turns raw resources into trash. Now add in recycling:<p><pre><code>           RECYCLING (small %)\n      &#x2F;--------------------------\\\n      | PRODUCTION   CONSUMPTION |\n  RAW v=====*============*=======^=&gt; LANDFILL\n  MATERIALS\n</code></pre>\nSince no recycling is perfect, all you do is take some (often small) bit of resources and let it loop around the pipe once, maybe twice, before it gets used up to the point of being non-recyclable. It only delays the inevitable. Given that the pipeline grows exponentially, that small loop there pretty much doesn&#x27;t matter. That&#x27;s why <i>Reduce</i> is the most important of the three Rs.')
