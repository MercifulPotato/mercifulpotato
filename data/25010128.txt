Basically, are you accepting Scheme code from untrusted users, or is it just a bundled part of the app?<p>The reason I&#x27;m asking is that that run-time flexibility can completely bite you in the ass if someone can submit code that does unacceptable, unanticipated things. For example, I had an engagement with a company to review their main application, that they host. The issue was that while the app was in Java, it accepted user templates in (IIRC) BeanShell. One quick System.exit() in a template as a proof of concept, and Tomcat came thundering down.<p>The concept still works of course if you restrict the language accepted to some minimal DSL.')
