I was thinking more along the lines of having a key in the file chooser settings schema that would be observed by Nautilus.<p>The idea there is that the key should be in a standard location read by nautilus (or some other GTK file manager) if it also decides to implement that feature. Edit: I also should note that it appears there was not even initial consensus about this, the other GTK developer seemed to be skeptical at first.')
