Instead of teaching people how to teach themselves the skills they need and develop accurate and honest self-assessment techniques<p>This assumes that low self-esteem (and consequently impostor syndrome) are logical esteem issues - in other words, one learns to perform the correct calculations, and the problem is solved.<p>I believe low self-esteem problems are emotional in nature, and there&#x27;s no amount of correct calculations that can solve that. There is an associated phenomenon indeed - the bucket with a hole; if somebody has low self-esteem, no matter how they fill the bucket, the bucket will never be full.<p>I agree that there is a reinforcement cycle with increase of skills, and that there is a component of &quot;self-medication&quot; that one can apply, but in general, I believe that low self-esteem has different causes, and is better handled by qualified professionals.<p>&gt; The end result of all this was an increasingly massive cottage industry devoted to self-esteem<p>This in my opinion is a problem inside the problem: mainstream, unqualified, gurus are damaging, as they divert attention from qualified therapy.')
