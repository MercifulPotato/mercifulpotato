They are doing things to make that plastic easier to recycle when its needed. Currently in the US, it seems as long as your package is hypothetically recyclable you can stamp it with the logo regardless of the burden it places on the user or recycling company.<p>Not sure if another country has this but I&#x27;ve often wished we had better recycling information on packaging that was driven by recyclers practical experience. It would be nice if companies could put a distinct logo on their package if it was immediately recyclable (aluminum cans) vs requiring some disassembly (cracker boxes with plastic sleeves) vs virtually unrecyclable (soft plastic wrapping around moist foods).')
