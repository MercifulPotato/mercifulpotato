They are preventing even logging into their portal (and therefore cannot do anything to the IP whitelisting, so I am in a catch 22.)<p>I would like to upgrade so I can talk to a human. But I have to login to do that.<p>I have created tickets and they have asked to verify my account (where I tell them small $ amount that they charged) and now there has been no reply since the last few days.<p>I called twilio sales so I can upgrade to the higest level of service so I can talk to a human so I can get unlocked, but sales tells me that they are different teams.<p>This has been a repeating pattern with sendgrid (they do the worst thing - which is to not respond to a support request..)<p>I highly recommend staying away from sendgrid. I will be moving as soon as I get a chance. If you can help, my support ticket # is 5322073 and 5322368')
