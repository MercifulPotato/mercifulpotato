It appears the graph embed examples are missing in the master branch, unfortunately.<p>I wonder if this can be used more trivially to solve simple problems too - like calculating values&#x2F;sums pertaining to compound interest&#x2F;investment, given a naive function for calculating sums etc (its trivial to add up compounded interest and deposits, but a tiny bit more complicated to answer the question &quot;at what time is my portfolio at X or more dollars).')
