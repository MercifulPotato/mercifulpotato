Name a single major retailer that does this. I&#x27;ve yet to hear of a single one doing this.<p>Amazon is a bookstore. Go to any other bookstore or even distributor, and ask how quickly folks get paid who sell into their market. These folks drag the absolute HELL out of payment.<p>And yes, the local bookstore can return the books. They are generally not taking inventory risk.<p>Same thing with a grocery store. Want to get on shelf? Pay a fee? Want to sell in store? Until you prove sales volume so risk is gone, you will need to be willing to accept product returns and pay fee to cover whatever you replaced.<p>Want data on how your product sold at store level &#x2F; by day &#x2F; time etc? Be prepared to PAY for that. BTW - amazon merchants get most of this for free.<p>The time to pay for a product that sells in a retail store and amazon is different, and much WORSE for the retail store. You can get next day payout availability for FBA from amazon. If you sell a product through a distributor into retail - if you think you are going to get next day payment - dream on.')
