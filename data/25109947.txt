It was my first real chess book and it was a very fun read. I am often intimidated by too many diagrams and endless variations in books, and he has a great way to tell a story about the psychology at the board. You do need an interest in psychology in chess to be able to enjoy the book, if it is just about the moves for you it might not be that great (there are diagrams ofcourse).<p>Some subjects in the 20 or 25 chapters are: Time management, the more time you spend at a move, the less merit there is, while that time might be important in the endgame. There is a chapter about chess as a game of chance, like, you play a tournament and make 5 out of 9. Next year at the same tournament, you make 4 out of 9. Did you play worse? You might think so and rationalize that thought to become some truth to you, but really, it is just one game that might have been decided by one move. The same for winning or losing rating points, which can be a plus or a minus based on just 1 game difference, that doesn&#x27;t make your last 3 months bad or good.')
