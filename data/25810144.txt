When hiking in mountains, on some nights the sky is so clear, air so still and light pollution so low that I can easily discern eight or nine &quot;sisters&quot; there. Such nights are usually in summer, but less frequently also during other seasons.<p>Of course, in or near large cities, seeing five or six of the &quot;sisters&quot; is about the best one can hope for.')
