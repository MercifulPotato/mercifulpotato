For a while, the American tech press was pretty doting on Alibaba and a lot of people in the west still had the hope that China was going to be a great new frontier for western products and cultural exchange, thanks to the booming middle class.<p>A lot of that goodwill started getting frittered away as the CCP were involved with events that appeared to threaten freedom&#x2F;democracy and autonomy both in the China region and around the rest of the world. Just a few off the top of my head...<p>- 2016 Artificial islands and military bases built in South China Sea<p>- 2017 Four Corners report on CCP influence operations in Australia<p>- 2017 HRW report on Uighur reeducation camps<p>- 2018 Xi Jinping dissolves term limits<p>- 2018 Two Michaels detained<p>- 2019 Hong Kong National Security Law and protests<p>- 2020 Coronavirus<p>- 2020 Ladakh border skirmishes<p>There are lots more examples.
