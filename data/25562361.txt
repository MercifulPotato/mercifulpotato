On second reading you sound like satire and irony.<p>Anyway, I forgot to add git to the list of tools needed. It&#x27;s really easier once you throw git into the whole thing.<p>&gt; Good luck extracting sensible data from WordPress’ database without losing metadata.<p>What ? You know you can do SQL queries, right ? And if you can set up the whole bang for jekyll&#x2F;git you certainly can do SQL queries. And use the WP rest API. And the internal WP query API. You are more likely to lose integrity of your metadata stored in a yaml header in md files because of a typo at some points. How do you even start to lose metadata when WordPress enforces consistency and validation on every article saves ?<p>But forget about all that, that&#x27;s software dev stuff. WP comes with built-in to sort and look at metadata and posts.<p>&gt; Which one has the worst lock-in? The former certainly isn’t locked to anything.<p>Now you are trolling. You know full well I am refering to storing files in github. Which is owned by the good old and trusty evil MS. Not saying it&#x27;s not easy to move things (you don&#x27;t send your files only to gihub, right ?) but tying yourself to github is a worst lock-in than your own mysql database.<p>&gt; GitHub Pages with Jekyll don’t even need an explicit build step.<p>That just doesn&#x27;t make any sense. There are way more steps before you can even type &#x27;git push&#x27; and then hit a browser URL <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.github.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.github.com&#x2F;</a><p>And that&#x27;s just for the setup of the whole thing. It&#x27;s always gonna be faster to move around widgets and widgets content to cusomize sidebars and footers in WordPress than diving into jekyll templates.<p>And this is from a guy who spent the afternoon setting up strapi on a VPS and is getting into gatsby because it looks fun.')
