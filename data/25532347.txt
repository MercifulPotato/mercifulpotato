Item(by='metal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608850940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528044, text='18 hours is absurd, IMO. I have a Garmin Instinct Solar that gets up to 24 days of battery life without any solar exposure (there&#x27;s unlimited battery life with enough exposure unless you use GPS a lot). I get notifications for any phone app I want, plus GPS when I need it and a multitude of fitness tracking, including round the clock heart beat monitoring. I can&#x27;t use it as a phone or send texts (though I can read them) so I guess that&#x27;s where it &quot;lags&quot; behind the Apple Watch. I think it&#x27;s the perfect fitness tracker that&#x27;s also a rugged watch.')
