Item(by='smspf', descendants=None, kids=[25479285], score=None, time=1608396984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25472821, text='&gt;In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor.<p>Either that one was used to compromise the supply chain (in which case it makes little to no sense to keep it around and risk detection), or at least 2 different groups had the chance to target sensitive US infrastructure.<p>Funny how media coverage of this issue misses no chance of mentioning Russia and nobody else, not even possible suspects.<p>I wonder what happens if the attackers notice each other on the compromised system. Do they get along in exfiltrating data or do they fight quietly?')
