Because my #1 job as a clearer is to make sure that, at the end of the day, all the money I am owed is actually there.<p>If GME crashes, then the total portfolio of Robinhood and its clients will lose a lot of value. In theory, Robinhood and its clearer has no skin the the GME game, but, in practice, there are quite a few examples of financial companies taking massive hits when their clients go under.<p>So yes, the clearer could easily be willing to let Robinhood buy more stock that is seen as uncorrelated to GME but be extremely uncomfortable with the size of Robinhood’s position.  This is similar to how Robinhood won’t let its clients hold positions when they have insufficient margin to cover the anticipated possible loss.')
