Wouldn&#x27;t be the first time.<p>Farmers lose small sheep to foxes. Lynx clean an area of foxes and defend bigger territories. Yes a couple of lynx can kill a lamb here and there, but currently they have yet twelve foxes in the same area trying to do the same all the time and living under the farm basement, so...  what option looks better for the farmers? My bet would be &quot;much less foxes and a lynx&quot;')
