One of my past school used to hand them out like candies. It costs like a dollar for 10 and made everyone happy. Same with trophies and medals. After some questioning and feedback from a lot of people indirectly, I concluded that it&#x27;s one of the best investment any school can make. It results in lot of good PR, recognition, talks, feel good, etc.<p>It&#x27;s useful to target and engineer certain behaviors in students. Many of them conflate their value and status with those papers.<p>You can make money by holding competition to handout these and charge for chairs, food and other stuff.<p>Many students won&#x27;t talk about certificates and medals with their classmates because they will be aware of how easy it is to get one but they will boast about it to kids from other schools and their parents. Ha, better conversion rate if someone is looking to transfer their kid to a better school.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how not enough schools are doing this and still cheap out on $100 total spend every month at best.')
