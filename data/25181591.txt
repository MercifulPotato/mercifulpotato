When someone chooses to focus on the worst of ourselves, their pessimistic perspective, generally speaking, doesn&#x27;t bring out the best in ourselves.<p>I do appreciate how they concluded:<p>&gt; When given the choice, we optimize.<p>&gt;<p>&gt; Then we work.<p>Yes. Please focus on this. Our humanity is mostly best suited to receive positivity. Accept the negativity (read: unideal outcomes) but move forward with the positivity on building a better world. On building a world that understands more. On building a world that expresses abundance and joy.<p>The author seems to equate that work is somehow inherently evil. I&#x27;d say this is only true if it&#x27;s a zero sum game but if it&#x27;s an infinitely unbounded game then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s profitable to everyone.')
