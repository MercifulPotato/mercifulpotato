Congress looking the other way is a clear abdication of responsibility here, but there has been enough plausible grey area to get away with this over many recent decades of American foreign policy.<p>But I don&#x27;t know any serious person who would look at a nuclear first strike and think there&#x27;s any debate about whether or not that constituted an outright declaration of war.<p>We definitely need to make this more explicit though, and not rely on out of control President to test it.')
