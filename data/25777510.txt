It&#x27;s\none thing to avoid unnecessary bloat. But going for short code\nat any cost doesn&#x27;t seem to be the ideal solution either; now\nwe&#x27;ve got over 100 patches for dwm, created based on the\nuntouched source code of some specific dwm version. The result\nis a bit of a mess, only worsened by the source code containing\nalmost exclusively 1-2 letter variable names.<p>Nonetheless I like most suckless projects, especially st and\ndmenu are fantastic. Even though the push against bloat is more\nneeded on the internet. I&#x27;m tired of all the tracking, loading\ntimes and memory usage, despite ad blockers.')
