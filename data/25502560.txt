He&#x27;s a great kid. Much better than most pharma execs, believe me. This &quot;bad guy&quot; image is all illusion. He had to take the fall for the real nasty people, the real ruthless operators who know how to politick. Analyze Shkreli&#x27;s mistakes, and you&#x27;ll notice he was always far too honest and forthright. Good people tend to wear their child-like nature as if it were a shield - but in the big leagues it only gets you hit. His only flaw was he isn&#x27;t a hardened scammer; the professionals came down on him because he was a talented outsider bringing attention to inconvenient places. Shkreli Did Nothing Wrong.')
