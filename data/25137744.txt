Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[25138535], score=None, time=1605713069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137687, text='In a (still very hypothetical) world where some group&#x2F;class of employees are overwhelmingly remote&#x2F;distributed, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that salaries tend to equalize at least within the US. That&#x27;s a lot of hypotheticals, of course. However, if it were to become the case, why would I have any reason to pay you a premium to live in Manhattan or SF any more than I would pay you a premium to live in Aspen.<p>ADDED: Salary is pretty sticky in a downward direction. However, over time, one can imagine levels equalizing as things like RSUs&#x2F;bonuses become more similar across locations.')
