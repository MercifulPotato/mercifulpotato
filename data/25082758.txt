They are all good enough and have been for a long time. What people care about are applications. If you want to play games, you are probably going to buy a Windows computer. If you want to run Logic, you&#x27;re going to buy a Mac. If all you really need is a browser and email, you are going to choose by other criteria like price or beauty.')
