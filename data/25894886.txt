Bedtime of 10pm or 2am, exercise or no, light exposure or no, late eating or no - always the same result. Then I&#x27;m awake for a few hours, then get my &quot;second sleep&quot; of 1 to 2 hours.  I&#x27;ve been going like this for a decade without daytime sleepiness (a few oz of coffee and I&#x27;m charged up for the day), but these kinds of articles really worry me.<p>I have light sleep apnea, but a CPAP didn&#x27;t help either. I&#x27;m old (60) so I&#x27;m considering trying melatonin to replace what I&#x27;m no longer producing, but I&#x27;m also wondering if I&#x27;m missing some other potential &quot;staying asleep&quot; lifestyle factors. Anyone here successfully dealt with the &quot;stay asleep&quot;issue other than with the variables I listed?')
