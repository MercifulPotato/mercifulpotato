Eg, why are networks with skip connections SO much better than networks without? What about batch normalization?<p>Is this true though, or does network architecture only matter in terms of <i>efficiency</i>?  This is non rhetorical, I really don&#x27;t know much about deep learning. :) I guess i&#x27;m asking if with enough data and compute, is architecture still relevant?')
