Everyone&#x27;s notion of documentation, its placement and role, can be different.<p>Some workplace relies on self-documenting code, some would require technical specs to be written in an internal wiki, some uses function&#x2F;class&#x2F;module headers.<p>It is inevitable that someone would ask how should I read the documentation, and any question on slack should be treated as a chance for improvement and better UX for devs.<p>Repeated questions from different people is a sign of the lack of improvement in the same area.<p>My usual go-to method to partially solve this issue is to challenge newcomers to write the question they asked and the answer for it, including how to write it, or make change to an existing one, so that other newcomers will find it easier to onboard.')
