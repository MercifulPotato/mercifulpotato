There&#x27;s no need for proportion of popular vote to correspond to electoral votes.<p>What the supreme court has said, is that <i>if</i> any decision is delegated to a vote, then that vote must meet constitutional muster.<p>Using votes cast in another state to determine the results of what is a state election likely violates rights of voters within that state.<p>And <i>those</i> rights are not wholely the legislature&#x27;s to delegate away.<p>It&#x27;s essentially extrajudicial gerrymandering.<p>Separately, and coming from another angle- it likely violates the constitution&#x27;s guarantee of a republican form of government.')
