All I can guess is that they stole someone&#x27;s lunch money. Or people feel the need to justify their cellphone purchases by coming up with specious arguments against the &quot;competition&quot;.<p>1) Not all disasters can be evacuated away from.

And those telephone poles are also probably carrying data.<p>3) You can&#x27;t dial 911 via email.<p>Cell network congestion is a well known phenomenon when disasters strike. It&#x27;s been seen multiple times in the past. Yes, landlines can and do fail as well, but they&#x27;re more resilient than cellphone networks.<p>Perhaps this will flip in the future, but it hasn&#x27;t, not yet.')
