What are you weighing your personal desire against? What else would you do with that money?<p>I don&#x27;t game much, but I get the impression that a AAA game costs $60 and provides about 20-30 hours of entertainment. That&#x27;s cheaper than a a movie theater and roughly on a par with a rental movie. It&#x27;s more expensive than watching the streaming service you&#x27;re already paying for, but would a streaming service have that much more content you want to watch? Or were you thinking of a completely different activity -- exercise, reading, etc?<p>You seem to have a pretty firm idea of how you feel about it, so I&#x27;m curious. HN readers are often in fairly well-paid professions and even $60 is unlikely to be a serious cost, so I&#x27;m interested in how they go about making spending decisions.')
