The maybe obvious step 1 is to switch to an unixoid OS such as Linux or Mac OS. Step 2 is to make the shell easily reachable, for example with buttons to open a shell in your current directory or with a drop-down terminal like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guake-project.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;guake-project.org&#x2F;</a><p>Then, whenever you have some everyday problem (frequently some &quot;batch&quot; or &quot;bulk&quot; job operating on many files), consider using the shell instead some 3rd party tools.<p>If you really are into it, consider working with suitable files. For instance, drop office files (MSO or LibreOffice&#x2F;OpenDocument) and instead switch to plain text files (Markdown or Latex). They are much easier to process in the command line. Also consider using git instead of dropbox and friends, because it is CLI-first. There is a universe waiting to be explored: There are CLI clients for almost everything (chatting, mail, web, etc.).')
