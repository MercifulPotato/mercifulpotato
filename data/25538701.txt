For a dot-matrix display, the original Gameboy Color is the best example I personally own, but I&#x27;m sure countless others exist.<p>The main trouble I think is that very few (any?) manufacturers are making front-lit LCD panels at typical monitor sizes and resolutions. I guess there&#x27;s not really a market for it? But if such a thing exists I&#x27;d compare the heck out of it and eInk.')
