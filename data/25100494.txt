Such a waste. Even the salesperson at the electronics store I bought it at recommended I get a cheaper no-frills model but my gadget lust won out. In fact looking at the video of that model it looks like they got smart and removed the images (my model is 4yrs old)<p>A video of the one I actually own<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eOV-2aYcZCs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eOV-2aYcZCs</a><p>I don&#x27;t know if Microwaves + Oven devices are common in the USA now. In the USA an oven is generally a standard included kitchen appliance, under the stove, over the broiler, where as in Japan ovens are not a normal kitchen appliance. So, it&#x27;s nice to be able to get one device that can do both Microwave, and Oven. This one does convection style oven and it has 2 tanks for water for steam and yes, I&#x27;ve grilled, baked, and done all kinds off stuff with it.<p>But, somewhat matching the salesperson&#x27;s prediction I&#x27;ve never once used any of the features on the menus. Either click &quot;microwave&quot; and the pick a time and power level. Or pick &quot;manual settings&quot; and then pick one of steam, broil, grill, etc, then set a temp and a time and go.')
