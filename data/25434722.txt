For more local, I try to find news aggregators, an example for Canada is nationalnewswatch.ca , takes articles from across the spectrum. This is really just for events though, when it comes to issues in tech, climate, etc that aren&#x27;t necessarily an event, I tend to look to individuals in the field who don&#x27;t go into politics for their analysis')
