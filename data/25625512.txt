Sort of.<p>&gt; I have a Mi Band 5, and wanted to use GadgetBridge instead of the official Mi Fit or Amazfit&#x2F;Zepp app.<p>&gt; I was surprised to learn this was not easy to do. I needed to retrieve the Bluetooth MAC from the proprietary app via rooted app, or by logging in via script, which no layman would do.<p>&gt; The watch is now paired with GadgetBridge, but the steps are hard enough to dissuade anyone from trying it.<p>There is now also an android app to fetch the key and gps almanac, very simple to do, no root or python required.<p>Note: I kivy wrapped and apk packaged the above mentioned script.')
