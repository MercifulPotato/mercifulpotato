Qubes is on Xen, and has its appVMs run an X server that operate on bitmaps that the domU copies to corresponding regions of its own framebuffer, and is handfed input events by the domU; similarly, sound and camera traffic, and network packets.<p>I am particularly thinking of e.g. a Firefox appVM that runs Firefox but not systemd; Or, transmission, or element-desktop. Running systemd, and a whole Linux kernel, in every appVM is a big drain on RAM.<p>So I guess I would need library renditions of the processes Qubes wants to run in its AppVMs, that start a thread when first called. Trick is how to get the app in; maybe it is an &quot;apt&quot; unikernel image that switches to the installed &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin image after running once.')
