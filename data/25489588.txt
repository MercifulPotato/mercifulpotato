It has been the default in fedora for years and works perfectly fine. The slow rollout is because nvidia won&#x27;t support it so only distros that reject nvidia like Fedora will ship it.<p>Fedora is probably the only distro actually pushing things forward without being tied down to vendors. When CgroupsV2 came out it was disabled for many years because docker didn&#x27;t support it.
