Item(by='vaduz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610823163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803291, text='&gt; Doesn&#x27;t Chrome upload everything downloaded to VirusTotal (a Google product)?<p>It doesn&#x27;t, unless you opt for SafeSearch &quot;Enhanced Protection&quot; or enable &quot;Help improve security on the web for everyone&quot; in &quot;Standard Protection&quot;. Both are off by default, IIRC.  Without it, it periodically downloads what amounts to bloom filter of &quot;potentially unsafe&quot; URLs&#x2F;domains.<p>On the other hand, GMail and GDrive do run the checks via VirusTotal, as far as we know - which means that OP case may have been caused by having some of the recipients having their incoming mail automatically scanned. It&#x27;s similar for Microsoft version (FOPE users provide input for Defender Smart Screen), at least last time I checked.')
