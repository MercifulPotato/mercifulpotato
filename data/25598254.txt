While there might be a consensus we could come up with, the problem with cancel culture is that it will seemingly be used to cancel any little thing that displeases SJWs _regardless_ of whether what was said is actually _not_ *phobic and whether or not it is objectively demonstrable and &#x2F; or a reasonable hypothesis &#x2F; statement.<p>That is what is outrageous to many; the over-abuse of this tactic against just about anyone all the time. The most maligned figure I can think of is Jordan Peterson ; please explain in an articulated fashion WITH SOURCES why you don&#x27;t like the guy ? I have seen so much false and distorted stuff about the dude it&#x27;s not funny.')
