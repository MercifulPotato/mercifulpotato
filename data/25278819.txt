That was not me misrepresenting anything.<p>I&#x27;m always perplexed by the people that claim it is clear that nuclear power is a lost cause. If the evidence is so strong that renewables are the best economic choice, why is this company making up shit to draw people away from nuclear? Why do people resort to disaster scare tactics if nuclear isn&#x27;t at least competitive on price?')
