My iPhone is at least three times as thick as the screen of my MacBook, and I&#x27;d be surprised if they aren&#x27;t using at least some of that depth on the front camera.<p>What I would like to see is official support for using the <i>back</i> iPhone cameras as a webcam, but I don&#x27;t expect to: it looks like Apple wants to remove the last port on the phones, no matter how dumb an idea that might be, and then they&#x27;d have to deprecate this feature, which would draw attention to the loss of functionality such a silly move would entail.<p>I really hope I&#x27;m wrong about this implication of the new MacSafe, the idea of owning a phone with no wired connection just makes me nervous. But it would be in character for the company.')
