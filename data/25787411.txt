For Graphistry, we ended up going proprietary for our core GPU visual analytics and went open for more generic infra and client codes, e.g., launched one of the Apache Arrow languages and our popular Python&#x2F;Jupyter lib. I&#x27;m still looking forward to the day we can open our core as well (all our $B&#x2F;$T partners ask us to, and yet ;-)). Encouragingly, our users are increasingly preferring the marketplace + saas versions, so I remain optimistic about an SSPL-ish license. That 90%+ of ES users go with SSPL is promising!')
