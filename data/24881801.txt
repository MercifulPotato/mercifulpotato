Why not include the Quran and Book of Mormon in the holy scriptures as well if the Bible isn&#x27;t the &quot;end-all&quot;? </i><p>Because, as I said, in traditional Christianity, while the Bible is not the be-all-end-all, it&#x27;s not supplemented by anything-and-everything.<p>Rather, the other important elements are the oral tradition of christians, lived experience of the church community, the so-called prominent figures (&quot;fathers of the church&quot;), etc.<p>So the Bible is not everything, but there&#x27;s no room for the and Quran and Book of Mormon in there still -- there are other things that are accepted by (non protestant) Christianity that supplement the Bible -- not just anything.')
