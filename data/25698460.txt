Power at any cost, and who cares if it means we rile up rubes by telling them whatever they want to hear - sympathising with whatever dumbass thing they believe in (without actually saying we believe it too). Everyone in the RNC that went along had the delusion that they could control this golem of their own making. Recent events provend them wrong, and a whole bunch of them just had their &quot;oh shit&quot; moment. So no, the Republicans aren&#x27;t dumb. They just got too greedy. Gerrymandering wasn&#x27;t enough. Voter disenfranchisement laws weren&#x27;t enough. They had to &quot; go there&quot; - where many, many other political movements have gone before. Take one poor, struggling, powerless mass of people, and relentlessly feed their ignorance, victim-hood, desire for some control in their lives. And do so dishonestly, carelessly and with no thought for the outcome or those people themselves.<p>As a long-time Black Sabbath fan, the RNC&#x27;s actions in recent days remind me of the lyrics of this song:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyricsfreak.com&#x2F;b&#x2F;black+sabbath&#x2F;too+late_20019325.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyricsfreak.com&#x2F;b&#x2F;black+sabbath&#x2F;too+late_2001932...</a><p>EDIT: It occurs to me that the DNC has done this _to an extent_ with people of colour. However I do believe there is a qualitative difference. Think Bolsonaro vs Ardern.')
