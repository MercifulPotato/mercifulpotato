By far the worst part of my injury was coming off the nerve block at 5am and taking a Percocet every 30 minute until I could fall asleep at 9am while holding back my groans so as to not wake up anyone else in the house.<p>My anecdote was I once asked for a prescription for 1 Percocet per month for the one time a month I need serious pain relief and was referred to physio therapy after having already done 2 years of it. I even had my previous prescription from the surgery with 40 out of the 60 pills remaining to offer as proof of my none addiction. I often wonder how many live with chronic pain because of similar circumstances.')
