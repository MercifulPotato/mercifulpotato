The CEO has a responsibility to make sure every element of credit is given where it&#x27;s due.<p>3) The commenter below mentioned they are &#x27;not small&#x27; - this is not quite true - they are 1000 people, which is actually relatively small for such a firm, their massive $20-25B valuation likely comes from kind of earlier understanding that they had a vaccine that was probably working, and such info was slowly leaked out to market over time. The the founder is &#x27;Stock Rich&#x27; to the point of &#x27;100th Richest German&#x27; is really not a big deal.<p>There going to have to get out there and try to be as well known as some of the bigger brands.<p>Edit: I should point out that both Space X and Tesla would absolutely not exist were it not for the kind of communications strategy that Musk has embarked upon. Literally his appearance on Stephen Colbert was not only a plea for cash, but a plea for people to &#x27;join the movement&#x27;. These things pervade just consumer elements and helps give him power and attention within other, non-consumer facing business operations such as the closed world of &#x27;space&#x27;. Having made himself a very famous person enables him to open quite a lot of doors, get a lot of meetings, raise a lot of money, hire a lot of inspired people, which creates a virtuous circle unto it&#x27;s own once products are materially released etc.. He did a great job of that.')
