Sorry it took so long to respond to. Since it&#x27;s stale, I&#x27;ll keep it brief.<p>Like I said, I was working from notes. I reread his piece carefully. I don&#x27;t find Taibbi&#x27;s defense very persuasive; for instance, I think if you read his piece, it&#x27;s pretty clear that he&#x27;s suggesting that PE firms put up pennies on the dollar, and that they were in some manner culpable for the first dotcom bubble and for the 2008 crisis. I also think that even when Taibbi is &quot;right&quot;, what he&#x27;s mostly doing is hyperventilating over banal side-issues that aren&#x27;t the real problem. I read his writing about downside protection for PE deals and wonder what he&#x27;d say about liquidation preferences.<p>But either way: I concede the point that Taibbi&#x27;s LBO writing is mostly notable because Dan Primack took the time to write a takedown. It&#x27;s not as bad as his NYC parking meter writing, or his Obama bailout writing, or, god help us, his writing on dark pools and HFT.<p>On the other hand: being (mostly) directionally right about  LBOs is kind of a lay-up? Like, it was the plot of Wall Street.')
