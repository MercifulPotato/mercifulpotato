Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[25348261, 25348054, 25348130], score=None, time=1607446404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345699, text='&gt;The difference between a $50 and $200 pair of headphones is staggering.<p>You fall exactly for the trap the parent is talking about. &quot;$50 earphones&quot; and &quot;$200 earphones&quot; is meaningless. There are many reasons why earphones can be more or less expensive, many of which have nothing to do with audio quality. Things like wireless support, quality of the materials used and whatever brand is embossed on it. My $50 &quot;studio&quot; AKG 240 are probably as good as many $200 earphones, but they&#x27;re all plastic and not wireless.')
