Besides mixing up misconceptions on how git works and where git&#x27;s version control mechanics ends and branching patterns start, the article reads as if the author is presenting misconceptions as past errors and current misconceptions as truths. I get it that everyone has their personal learning journey, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone benefits by watching the mistakes taken throughout the trip.')
