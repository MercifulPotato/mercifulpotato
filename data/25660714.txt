People actually edited code in a text editor and then submitted it to github and waited an hour for the CI job to build a virtual Windows instance, run updates, install Visual Studio, Oracle, and all supporting software, run the compile and bail with a syntax error :((((((<p>So I made a Powershell script to install everything from scratch on a fresh Windows 10 or Windows Server system using Chocolatey. The script took about an hour to run, but once it was done you had a Windows box (or VM) that could build the project in 2 minutes at most, or just run the CI script directly before committing. Suddenly it didn&#x27;t take weeks to fix bugs in the Windows client, and corrupted installs or DLL hell was one &quot;wipe&quot;, &quot;run script&quot;, &quot;walk away while it churns for an hour&quot; cycle to a perfect dev environment again.<p>I was fired 6 months later for &quot;not stepping up enough&quot;.')
