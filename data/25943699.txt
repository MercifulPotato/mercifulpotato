Loosely, market manipulation happens when you artificially influence the price of a stock, resulting in a personal gain. Buying stock with the intention of causing a short squeeze can be interpreted to fit that definition. I believe that WSB is creating artificial demand to try to &quot;screw over&quot; certain institutional investors. I am not a lawyer; this is not a legal interpretation.<p>Bill Ackman went on CNBC last year in near tears saying the end was coming, helping stocks continue their nose dive...all the while he was buying tons and tons of stocks which he turned into billions. How is that allowed but people on a message board sharing positions and high number of short floats isn&#x27;t? There is literally, and has been for a long time, a website that tells you the short interest in a stock. It&#x27;s sole purpose is to help people find short squeezes. That&#x27;s why you have stats like &quot;days to cover.&quot;')
