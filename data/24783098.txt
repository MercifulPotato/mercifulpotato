It is wholly inappropriate to make something public that very likely can be handled appropriately without the public fallout. I would call it unethical to your coworkers to create unnecessary damage to your team or your company by ignoring the appropriate process for handling sensitive internal issues.<p>If things are being shoved under the rug by management, that is an entirely different issue.')
