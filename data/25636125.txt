Further, we&#x27;ve made it REALLY hard to share such medical data in the first place.<p>Now, I get WHY we do this.  There are a lot of good reasons (privacy and insurance issues come to the top of my mind).  However, we should be working to eliminate those reasons as much as possible.<p>What we need to advance human understanding of medicine is a national database of medical data that&#x27;s publicly available.<p>Ideally, We&#x27;d record every measurable aspect about a person in this database and update it throughout their lives (when did they get vaccinated? What allergies do they have? Did they get any cancers?)<p>That sort of a database would make it really easy to start mining for treatments, correlations, etc.  It&#x27;d even have some positive benefits like removing the need for every doctors visit giving you a form with 50000 questions you&#x27;ve answered a million times before.<p>But I get why we don&#x27;t do this.  We don&#x27;t do this for fear of police overly relying on genetic information to &quot;prove&quot; someone committed a crime (We found your DNA at the scene, you must be guilty).  We don&#x27;t do this out of fear of Insurance companies exploding their rates when any sort of marker comes up (Oh, you&#x27;ve got Gene XYZ that means you&#x27;ll probably die sooner, so you get a higher rate or we won&#x27;t insure you).  We don&#x27;t do this because of issues around discrimination (Oh, you have (had?) HIV? You must be gay and we hate gay people here).<p>But, man, do I wish we could somehow shape society so some day we could do it.  It&#x27;d have the potential for so much good.')
