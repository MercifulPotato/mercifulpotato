Thatâ€™s when I get irritated by stupid phone calls and turn off all of my messaging alerts. I used to do that sort of thing well over fifteen or sixteen hours at a time, but I have tried to curb those types of long sessions recently. I do not think the work improves just because you put in  longer hours and perhaps needs even more cleaning up afterwards. so now I tend to think it is just as important to step away from things for a while and do something completely different.')
