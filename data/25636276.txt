Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=[25636388], score=None, time=1609787131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635433, text='B) is basically what we have already. Contractually only required to work 40 hour weeks, no [official] pressure from management to work more, but anyone who does will most likely have higher output &#x2F; receive better performance bonuses and recognition, etc.<p>The only thing a union brings to the table in this situation is now I&#x27;m either explicitly forbidden from working more on a project even if I want to, or I have to hide what I&#x27;m doing and go all cloak-and-dagger about it, probably breaking some kind of labor laws in the process. All for 1% of my salary. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a good trade for me?')
