Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25162897, 25163085], score=None, time=1605894157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162768, text='&quot;Continental philosophy&quot; isn&#x27;t useless, either, except by the definitions of those who made up the term &quot;continental philosophy&quot;. They have a very limited notion of what &quot;utility&quot; is.<p>The things targeted as &quot;continental philosophy&quot; are mostly meaning-of-life questions. Those aren&#x27;t &quot;useful&quot;, but they&#x27;re important to people. It&#x27;s no more useless than literature or video games or skiing, which you don&#x27;t need but are exactly what people do when they&#x27;re not doing things that they are required to do.<p>Not all &quot;continental philosophy&quot; is done well, and the vagueness of the question means that it&#x27;s hard to distinguish rigorously between &quot;well done&quot; and &quot;not well done&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t diminish meaning, or value, that people find in it.')
