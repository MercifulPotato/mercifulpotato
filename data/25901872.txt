Item(by='rob74', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611572712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901733, text='Ok, if you want to get into the details of this particular accident... it can be argued that UX issues made it easier for the pilots to make the fatal mistake they made (and the lawyers representing the victims&#x27; families of course made that argument, because going after Boeing is far more promising than going after a small airline which declared bankruptcy soon after the accident), but in the end it was still human error. Aircraft are complex systems which can&#x27;t be made 100% foolproof, that&#x27;s why they are flown by qualified and trained pilots who have checklists for things that have to be done before take-off, and one of them was checking the pressurization system (&quot;the flight crew overlooked the pressurization system state on three occasions: during the pre-flight procedure, the after-start check, and the after take-off check&quot;).<p>...and the courts ultimately had nothing to do with it, because the suit against Boeing was settled out of court. Which is not an &quot;admission of guilt&quot; on the part of Boeing, just &quot;give them some money to make this unpleasant thing go away&quot;.')
