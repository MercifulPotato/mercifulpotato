Item(by='Zenst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605532523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110680, text='&gt; Books are a classic thing that should just be digitized and the originals sold off.<p>I&#x27;d generally agree though thinking it thru - there have been instances in which researchers have found hidden ink&#x2F;pages hidden under pictures and other such discoveries that would not be possible with a simple digital scan.  Xray&#x27;s and other spectral light scans on-top of the visual spectrum RGB scans may be a solution but that is not at a level for today&#x27;s scanning of such works and costly already without that step.<p>So mixed feelings and in general, yes they should be scanned - but as a reason to offload the original - that has some grey area&#x27;s that would need addressing.')
