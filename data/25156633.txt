There were some mitigations, in both kernels and browsers, but they were and are not 100%, the only 100% mitigation is still to disable SMT. Do you really want to do that? Most people it seems aren&#x27;t willing to give up SMT.<p>This patchset for Linux was originally proposed over 20 months ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;780703&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;780703&#x2F;</a><p>After refining and optimizing this patch set for quite a while, it&#x27;s just about as fast as ... just disabling SMT completely (which is a lot simpler). The complexity this adds to the scheduler costs that much.<p>People&#x2F;companies really love the _idea_ of getting _all_ the performance of SMT and _all_ the security of mitigations, and don&#x27;t care as much that you actually still can&#x27;t have both, so this will be merged eventually.')
