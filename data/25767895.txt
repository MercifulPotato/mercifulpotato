Why doesn&#x27;t synchronous replication in Postgres work for this use case? With synchronous replication you have a primary and secondary. Your queries go to the primary and the secondary is guaranteed to be at least as up to date as the primary. That way if the primary goes down, you can query the secondary instead and not lose any data.')
