The adherence to these rules and the results of their controls must be confirmed yearly by a top-mgmt executive =&gt; if external audit discovers that that was false, and&#x2F;or if later events discover that that was false then that&#x2F;those executive&#x2F;s will burn and&#x2F;or you&#x27;ll be thrown out of their market (all this is the result of the last ~20 years of regulations, which I personally think is generally more good than bad, but which is definitely painful for me to deliver hehe).<p>I don&#x27;t think that this level of &lt;liability&#x2F;control&#x2F;regulation&gt; is in place for Robinhood &amp; Co. - not saying that such companies are bad, they&#x27;re probably interesting from a certain point of view, but customers should be made more aware of the embedded risks.')
