This year above all other years has been a year of growth. As you noticed my own production, Railgrade, is nearing ship. It helps that the games and anime industry has only grown thanks to COVID. My client work is at capacity. I was able to hire a friend thanks to Google&#x27;s hiring freeze.<p>Of course the back drop is I&#x27;ve lived and saved as if the world was always in a recession. Thus when the actual danger hits I was able to expand my business. As PG says, the best time to start a business is during a recession.<p>Personally I expect Japan to handle COVID economically better than most other countries. Japanese corporations have long be criticized for building cash warchests instead of upping dividends or buybacks. Thus Japan Inc has the balance sheets to leave the recession having acquired foreign assets.')
