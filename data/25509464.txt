The mirrorless camera solution sucks because there’s not an obvious winner there either (and you usually need a capture card&#x2F;camlink to convert the output from the camera).<p>The room scale ones like the LG meetup are overpriced and generally awful, the PTZ versions from them are even more expensive, use proprietary connectors for the mics and require a host of unnecessary external boxes.<p>The Facebook portal TV is a great product for most people, but I just want something like that I can plug into a PC.<p>There’s a vacuum in this market. The current options are either low quality, overpriced enterprise stuff or dealing with the hassle of a mirror less cam setup.')
