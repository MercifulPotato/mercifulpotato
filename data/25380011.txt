A huge portion of our field radios and cryptography devices were affected by this. I want to say I remember a crystal diode having to be replaced. These are used for timing.<p>Interestingly, the Marines keeps a stock of non-crystal diode radios for exactly this event. We had enough radios at the time not to need this, but cool to see this event was remembered by someone other than myself.')
