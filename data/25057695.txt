It is very difficult to do proper research training as a hobby, and essentially impossible to do a research apprenticeship (which is what a PhD is) outside of an environment where you are being supervised by other PhDs. If you have a spouse or close friend who&#x27;s prepared to supervise you, fine - but otherwise it&#x27;s likely to be at a university or research lab.<p>Coupled to that, PhD slots are generally funded, so university at PhD level is normally less &#x27;expensive&#x27; and more &#x27;opportunity costs&#x27;.')
