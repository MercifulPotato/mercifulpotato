You can copy the sources now, compile it, and use for as long as it works. At some pint in the upgrade cycle the binary will stop working, and at that time you can recompile the sources you have. Chances are you will be able to recompile it without a single change, and if some modifications turn out necessary, they&#x27;re very likely minor.<p>Of course the problem with this approach is that you won&#x27;t receive security updates - but if the developers already consider the tool insecure, it might not matter much, especially if you use it only between hosts you control.')
