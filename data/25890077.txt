Because it&#x27;s not really a big thing in industrialized nations like the US, afaik.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy and quick for me to mail stuff.  Convenient too, I can use any mailbox at any time of day or night, or go to the post office. Mostly I use my building&#x27;s outgoing mailbox.<p>Anyway if I was worried about some sort of anti democratic street toughs or whatever it is you are positing, I&#x27;d say decentralized efforts would be way harder to disrupt or influence.<p>This seems just like a way to delay and disrupt the vote under the guise of election integrity.  So basically classic voter suppression.')
