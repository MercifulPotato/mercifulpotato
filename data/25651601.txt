(I&#x27;m not an immunologist; I genuinely have no idea.)<p>I&#x27;d have thought that it was all a statistics game: how many antibodies you have and how fast your white cells can respond to the threat before the virus got a foothold. In that model there is partial immunity: some people would win that race, and some wouldn&#x27;t.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong about that I&#x27;d appreciate a better model. Thanks.')
