My intuition for natural design would be something along the lines of microservices (like our biological organs), organically defining the greater entity they themselves form (the company).<p>Apple is just one illustration of systems getting out of control. Think of international politics, or edgecases in financial markets. Our systems didn&#x27;t escape us, because they were never truly under control.<p>Therefore, this isn&#x27;t dystopian. It is dystopian from a reference frame within wich you claim to have control, but you don&#x27;t, and you never had. To exercize any control over technological and economic progress is _way_ beyond our individual scope, by a margin of at least one level of abstraction.<p>Instead, this is a transition from one system (one with decentralized and autonomous components (subcontractors et al)) to the next (one with organic components).<p>Within our current game, that feels dystopian, but that won&#x27;t matter, because it won&#x27;t be the same game anymore. Iteratively, that is.')
