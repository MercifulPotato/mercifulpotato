Last time I checked human cognition and collaboration seemed to attract very little interest. I suppose this somehow falls into a slot of &quot;Human Productivity&quot;.<p>For instance - instinctively I find Clojure easier to work with than Scala. How is it different for different people and why? How does the cognitive complexity scale as the program scales? Do some languages foster collaboration better? As the team scales does the subjective complexity of a program scales in some languages better as the others?<p>Or something even more fundamental - why do some people write a lot of comments and other don&#x27;t. Is there a difference in program comprehension with different length of indentation or different formatting for that matter.<p>We need more insights into the psychology of programming (languages, design, comprehension, etc.). If that&#x27;s not possible we should at least do more rigorous philosophy of programming.')
