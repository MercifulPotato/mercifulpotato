A representative work is &quot;盐铁论” discussions on iron and salt.<p>Chinese civilization peaked in tang (in terms of international influence) and later song (in terms of tech and culture).<p>Then it&#x27;s a steady declination till the end of Qing.<p>Ancient China was quite liberal and diverse even in modern standards. But the history took a reverse turn to more totalitarian direction. (China never practiced authoritarian regime, even today, people just cannot admit or bother to learn the nuances of modern China political system, I am so very much disappointed there is no modern day Tocqueville on China, what a pity!)<p>Xi&#x27;s approach is fairly conventional in terms of Chinese tradition. But it has swapped the Confucius core with a blended scientific core through learning from Communism. This is a dangerous direction, as there is quite a risk of how to continue this tradition across generations, history has shown that declination and degradation is inevitable within 2-300 years time period. It will be interesting to see how Xi handles his succession. It might be quite disastrous. But it also has a lot of institutional safety backup.<p>Who knows! To me, this is the single most political affair in the next 10-20 years.<p>Xi is not a dictator, his life experience does not lend the ambition, nor his power can dominate the check and balance in China. Whoever labels xi a dictator is fooling his audience for some unspeakable purpose.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baike.baidu.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;%E7%9B%90%E9%93%81%E8%AE%BA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baike.baidu.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;%E7%9B%90%E9%93%81%E8%AE%BA</a>')
