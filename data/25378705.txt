All of the best AAA games are the best because a lot of people put a tremendous amount of effort into them. If you want to make a new game that&#x27;s a serious contender for one of the best games of all time, and you want an ambitious, deep world and story in a realistic setting, you&#x27;re going to have to match or exceed previous efforts. If you find enough people who are as interested in the concept and want to make it happen, it&#x27;s possible and it will probably never be a walk in the park.<p>There&#x27;s always a market for indie-scale games, 2D platformers, simple but innovative 3D games, etc, where good, simple ideas are more important than huge amounts of effort. But there&#x27;s also a market for complex games, and if they&#x27;re well done, people will happily pay for them.<p>source: over a decade in the modding and gamedev community, never done it professionally (yet) but have made some popular mods&#x2F;minigames, and a decent grasp of how much work goes into large-scale games and how much you have to want to make it happen for it to happen, and sometimes, you&#x27;re willing to spend these long days, and sometimes it&#x27;s even enjoyable before the money and fame start rolling in, or at least enjoyable enough to stick with it.<p>I hope, and suspect, nobody who is working on AAA games has zero interest or joy in making big, complicated games.<p>You get the job because you have skills at it. You have skills at it because you were interested enough to learn them. Those skills are worth money. All of the articles criticizing gamedev seem to miss this.')
