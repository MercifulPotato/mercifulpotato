Mr Trump denies the allegation.<p>&gt;Axios says that when Mr Trump was asked why he had held off imposing further sanctions on Communist Party officials over the issue of the camps, he said: &quot;Well, we were in the middle of a major trade deal.<p>&gt;&quot;And when you&#x27;re in the middle of a negotiation and then all of a sudden you start throwing additional sanctions on - we&#x27;ve done a lot. I put tariffs on China, which are far worse than any sanction you can think of.&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-53138833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-53138833</a>')
