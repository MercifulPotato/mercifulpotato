It&#x27;s been a part of the language for years now. It works much better than TypeScriptâ€“ I would say it&#x27;s as flexible as Haskell&#x27;s type system while being extremely easy to use and catching many bugs.<p><pre><code>    def sum(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int: ...\n</code></pre>\nUnlike Ruby and JavaScript, Python is strongly typed. You can&#x27;t add a string to a number, for example. Because it&#x27;s strongly typed, it&#x27;s much easier to add a type system. When I first started using the type system, it felt like it was always a part of the language, they just added a syntax and a checker. It doesn&#x27;t restrain me from what I would otherwise normally do in the language like TypeScript or Flow does. It&#x27;s a perfect fit.')
