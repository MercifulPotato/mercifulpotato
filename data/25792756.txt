I wonder if they will be able to put a magsafe wireless charging spot both under the laptop, and on top next to the trackpad! They could let you charge your iphone from your laptop, and charge the laptop via some fancy new magsafe pad.<p>In fact I wonder if this could include some of the &quot;air power&quot; tech that was reportedly cut a while back?')
