So having your own side project might require a level of people skills that programmers highly dedicated to their craft will likely not have.<p>I know people who dread &quot;their&quot; side projects because it just feels like additional unpaid work to them. I also know people who keep their side projects a secret from their employer.<p>If you select for people with corporate side projects, you&#x27;re likely selecting for future employees with bad people skills.')
