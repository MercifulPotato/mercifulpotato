I&#x27;m also aware that it failed twice within a couple of months -- which is far too frequently -- and the consequences of each failure were complete loss of the airframe. Anybody who has ever done risk analysis can see that MCAS was improperly designed and poorly implemented and the people who signed off on it should probably go to jail.<p>No new system whose failure could result in all souls lost <i>and is known to have a single point of vulnerability</i> should ever have been added to a commercial passenger aircraft.
