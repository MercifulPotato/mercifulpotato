Say at day 1 you released X methane that’s being directly added to the global total.  Now move forward to day X0,000, in some ways your adding X methane but because a little methane is decaying from every prior day the net result is not an increase of X, but an increase of X * 1&#x2F;2^(some number that keeps increasing).<p>So, sure the hover dam is adding net methane. But after 84 years it’s less than 1&#x2F;2 ^(84 &#x2F;9.1) or 0.17% as much as directly measured.  Further, the GWP of methane is calculated under the assumption it released from the ground where most sources like cows are releasing Carbon and Hydrogen that used to be in the atmosphere in the first place before photosynthesis etc eventually turned it into methane.<p>Also, unlike CO2 it’s really easy to reduce considerations simply by lowering emissions.<p>PS: I have seen several estimates around 7 years, I used 9.1 because the exact number isn’t that important.')
