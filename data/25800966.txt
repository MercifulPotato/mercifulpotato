It&#x27;s only when you start to write Zig that you need to take more time to understand, for example, the difference between the lifetime of a pointer to stack allocated memory vs a pointer to heap allocated memory.<p>But by then, I think Zig will have already hooked you.<p>Zig is also a great way to learn systems programming, because the design of the language and the std lib code itself is such a great teacher.')
