If <i>any</i> call to violence is supposed to be removed. Every tweet calling for the arrest of Trump (or anyone) also needs to be removed.<p>Edit: not sure if this is allowed but I&#x27;m curious why I am being downvoted? Is there some logic I&#x27;m missing here? Or I guess people just think state-sanctioned violence should be allowed? If so, wouldn&#x27;t this tweet by China be fine, since this violence is being done by the Chinese state?')
