I started to really feel this pain point at 3-4 other full-time engineers, where I was sort of trying to stay ahead of them and make sure that upcoming features were fully specc&#x27;ed and met the business needs as opposed to chipping in and coding myself.<p>I&#x27;m definitely tinted by my own experience, but it seems like 8-10 other engineers is a really late point to hit this bottleneck - did you have a PM that was also working to help plan the features to reduce this burden on you?')
