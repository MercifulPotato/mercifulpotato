Since I don&#x27;t tow their party line by focusing my attention on the same bad people, I&#x27;m &quot;othered&quot; and written off. This is more pronounced when talking to people on the red team than people on the blue team, but happens with both.<p>A simple example is &quot;GPS satellites tracking your phone&quot;. Trying to explain to people that the GPS satellites only transmit, but that it&#x27;s applications on your phone spilling your location, so there are steps you can personally take to avoid that - it just doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like my model of the situation doesn&#x27;t fit into their model, and rather than doing the work to understand what I&#x27;m saying, they&#x27;d rather continue with their comforting simplistic answer that generally combines defeatism with condemnation.<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m not sure what the best strategy for fighting this kind of weird mass idiotic groupthink is</i><p>If anyone has any ideas please share them. For basically any social movement, when I see it gets some traction I&#x27;ll think finally people are starting to care. But then as things progress, the movement takes on a life of its own and heads in the wrong direction without fail. It&#x27;s like instead of staying focused on the problem, opportunists looking for power supply a &quot;solution&quot; that steers the crowd into an easy non-answer to benefit themselves. And it doesn&#x27;t take many of them, because once the red herring becomes the groupthink dogma, pointing out its problems gets you othered.<p>I think the catastrophe we&#x27;re now experiencing is from the wave of &quot;normies&quot; discovering conspiracy theories. Early Internet denizens went through this phase a long time ago, and had to contextualize wild theories <i>within</i> mainstream thought. Even if we found them very compelling, we couldn&#x27;t just rant to everyone we met. But now that everyone and their aunt is on faceboot, not only can you repeat all the nonsense you&#x27;ve heard without being socially ostracized, you will actually gain popularity from it!')
