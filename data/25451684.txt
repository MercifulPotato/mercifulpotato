Ads cost more which raises the cost of doing business which raises the cost of goods.<p>2. It also makes certain borderline businesses infeasible -- there would be a whole class of businesses that don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t exist because they become unprofitable if you have to pay the ad monopoly&#x2F;duopoly piper on top of normal expenses.<p>3. You could also argue that FB&#x27;s continued dominance is another societal harm stemming directly from the alleged actions. If there wasn&#x27;t an ad cartel, it would be easier to start new ad-based social media companies. (Wouldn&#x27;t it be crazy if Google+ being neglected and then shutdown was a part of the negotiations between Google and FB?)<p>Lots of presumptions in the above, but I think a strong case could be made for each.')
