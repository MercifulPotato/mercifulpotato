C++ compilation is a nightmare &amp; it&#x27;s extremely expensive language to teach. JVM tuning is a nightmare and takes a while to setup (at which point it does run well relatively unattended, barring security fixes). With go, you practically need to work to <i>avoid</i> shipping an binary that can copy and run. You can learn the entire language in like two days and it can easily compile as you type with a decent latency to feedback (&lt;1 second, in my experience). Its FFI is about as usable as JNI, maybe a little better once you get past the awkwardness of using a separate stack. Its GC is good enough with reasonable bounds.<p>Keep in mind, I use rust and c++, primarily. I just look over the fence at go and can appreciate what it does well.')
