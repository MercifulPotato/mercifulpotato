Item(by='Dauros', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601833378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680115, text='&gt; Refactoring shouldn&#x27;t exist in this hypothetical game<p>Without refactoring the factory planning phase would be more difficult since I don&#x27;t want to fill the best places on the map with unmaintainable, non scalable factories. Refactoring should be very easy, e.g. like in Factorio with construction bots: just press ctrl + x and the bad part of the factory is gone.<p>If you want to build an abomination, try SeaBlock mod [1] for Factorio. You don&#x27;t have to refactor anything, space and resources are infinite, so just build a new factory next to the old one after you research a new tier of technology.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mods.factorio.com&#x2F;mod&#x2F;SeaBlock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mods.factorio.com&#x2F;mod&#x2F;SeaBlock</a>')
