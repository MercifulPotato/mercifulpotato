Item(by='leghifla', descendants=None, kids=[25546197, 25544112], score=None, time=1608996968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25543165, text='The differential (ignoring locking ones) applies the same force (approximately) to both wheels.\nIf you remember your physics course about lever and force, see the video at 5:00, you can see that the lever is pushed by its center, hence both sides have the same length. So the same force is applied to both wheels. But the speed can be different.<p>Hence, if one wheel is stuck, it still receives the same force as the other, only speed is lower.<p>What is more annoying is when one wheel is freely slipping (like on ice), the other will have nearly no force applied to it and the car is stuck.')
