Without spoiling you, it turns out not to be as great as expected.<p>Apart from this there is the somewhat classical : &quot;A famous quote tells us the three things every man should do during his time on earth: Plant a tree, have a son and write a book.

Itâ€™s like leaving a legacy and in a sense achieving a kind of immortality.&quot;')
