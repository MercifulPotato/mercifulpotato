If we do row-based rolling aggregation then then indeed we need to update records (i-n, i+n). Yet, the following difficulties may arise:<p>o Generally, we do not want to re-compute aggregates - aggregates should be also updated, particularly, if n is very large<p>o In real applications, rolling aggregation is performed using <i>partitioning</i> on some objects. For example, we append new events from many different devices to one table and want to compute rolling aggregates for each individual device. Hence, this (i-n, i+n) will not work anymore.<p>o Rolling aggregation using absolute time windows will also work differently. Although, if records are ordered (like in stream processing) and there are no partitions, then it is easy.')
