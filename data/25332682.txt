There&#x27;s SO many other ways to spin a story like that, and understanding that everyone has a breaking point is indeed a very important one.<p>There&#x27;s something very different between having clarity of mind and hyper focus under fire (the crisis situation at work), and handling multiple life stresses (e.g. family+work conflicts+++) at the same time. I mean, personally I can get a bit of a kick out of the first part - state of flow etc, whereas grinding family demands etc combined with other events that stack up in a cumulative manner is something completely different. To be better at the latter I hit the weights on a regular basis, which helps but does not make one immune.')
