You will not meet their demands. You tell them not to bother coming in tomorrow and disable their security badge, did you fire them?<p>They made the decision they did not want to work for you as had been previously agreed. You only changed the timetable.<p>To put this another way, if I tell my company that I will be quitting in 2 weeks and they tell me not to bother coming back to the office, did they fire me? I would not say they did.')
