We saw with Stuxnet how air gapped nuclear reactors could be hacked with USB drives. It&#x27;s patently absurd. Even if you do test the equipment, there could be sleeper code that only runs on election day. It&#x27;s absolutely nuts that we trust anything other than ink and paper with a fingerprint and signature.')
