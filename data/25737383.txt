Having to explicitly select &quot;new secret chat&quot; ultimately means the non-technical inclined can and will use it wrong, getting no privacy whatsoever.<p>Therefore, I cannot support the idea that Telegram is any better than WhatsApp or Discord.<p>Regarding &quot;open protocol&quot;, I suspect that what you think it means is not what an open protocol actually is.')
