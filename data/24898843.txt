The math in general relativity just doesn&#x27;t add up when applied to certain observations. They&#x27;ve essentially gotten 2 + 2 = 5. In order to fix that they just assume that one of those 2&#x27;s was actually a 3 somehow, and the extra 1 it picked up got labelled as dark matter. In other words, dark matter is just a term for some missing numbers somewhere in the calculation. Based on the different places where the extra numbers might be included they <i>think</i> it&#x27;s something with mass, but really that&#x27;s just a guess based on the existing formula and the changes that would be necessary to make it match the observation.')
