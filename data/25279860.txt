Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25280070, 25280605], score=None, time=1606934980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279095, text='&gt; Most RDBMSes (e.g. Postgres) only offer manual (`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW foo`) full-pass recalculation of the cached result-set for matviews.<p>&quot;Most&quot; here seems very much wrong, at least of major products: Oracle has an option for on-commit (rather than manual) and incremental&#x2F;incremental-if-possible (FAST&#x2F;FORCED) refresh, so it is limited to neither only-manual nor only-full-pass recalculation. SQL Server indexed views (their matview solution) are automatically incrementally updated as base tables change, they don&#x27;t even have an option for manual full-pass recalculation, AFAICT. DB2 materialized query tables (their matview solution) have an option for immediate (on-commit) refresh (not sure if the algo here is always full-pass, but its at a minimum not always manual.) Firebird and MySQL&#x2F;MariaDB don&#x27;t have any support for materialized views at all (though of course you can manually simulate them with additional tables updated by triggers.) Postgres seems to be the only major RDBMS with both material view <i>support</i> and the limitation of only on-demand full-pass recalculation of matviews (for that matter, except maybe DB2 having the full-pass limitation, it seems to be the only one with <i>either</i> the only-manual <i>or</i> only-full-pass limitation.)')
