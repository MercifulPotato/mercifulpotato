We are currently looking at expanding that into more of a linkedin type of network combining the tool with the ability to find work or find workers to hire.<p>With regards to the educational space we are building a LMS built more like an API that allow learning institutions or organizations with the need for employee education, certificate or compliance to easily manage their students&#x2F;employees education. While we offer things like video and course-building tools the idea is to allow for our customers to use the best tools for the job so ex. we support not just our own video platform but also zoom, MS teams etc.<p>And last but not least.<p>Because we built a whole video platform we are looking at another area which is live ecommerce such as the whole unboxing trend with things like collector cards as we know a few people in that space.<p>We are then working with founders or potential co-founders in those industries and try to see where we can find product market fit.')
