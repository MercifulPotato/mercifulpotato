A lot of times, I find that women in my life are more interested in how I or others are feeling&#x2F;acting, than the exact details of what actually is happening.<p>I like to think of this as report talk vs rapport talk. Men may just report facts to each other with very little emotion attached, whereas women will try and bond and strengthen relationships by telling stories about people and their feelings. This is why men struggle to understand why women in their life are angry that they never talk or don&#x27;t share how things are with their day. It&#x27;s because a lot of times, the two people think that the information they are sharing is what is important, and the other person thinks that it is too much&#x2F;too little detail.<p>I think those observational skills make women much more suitable for negotiating and understanding nuances, where sometimes men may struggle to have seen the smaller details.<p>But of course making sweeping gendered statements is usually not accurate or helpful, just some observations in my opinion, and of course MANY people do not fit into this generalisation.')
