Item(by='sleepysysadmin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605885173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159583, text='I guess every mask has &#x27;limited protection&#x27;. N95 is 95%. The limit being 95%.<p>The masks most people are wearing are &#x27;surgical masks&#x27; but those still tend to be in the 75% range. Which if both sides are wearing 75% masks, then the effectiveness is still relatively high. An effectiveness above 90%.<p>The article says:<p>“The results could indicate a more moderate degree of protection of 15-20%, however, the study could not rule out that face masks do not provide any protection.”<p>That&#x27;s just not in line with what we do know. Mask technology isn&#x27;t new. This seems overly broad as well, how did they account for say hand washing? Everyone had the same hand washing regime? I doubt they controlled for that.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, if you don&#x27;t trust in the level of masks. You are completely free to do better. This isn&#x27;t an argument to go backwards in protection.')
