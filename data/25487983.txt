The data is from around June if I recall correctly, so it could have gone up or down a bit, but I doubt it would change by an order of magnitude. What&#x27;s more, as we get the vaccine rolled out, almost all of these deaths are preventable. COVID is a unique event.<p>That being said, the shocking statistic I remember is when drug overdoses surpassed the COMBINATION of automobile accidents and homicides as a source of mortality.
