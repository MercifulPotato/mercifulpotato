Possibly a bit brittle, since you have to maintain your knowledge of the distribution somewhere -- i.e. it&#x27;s &quot;state you have to update or things might break,&quot; which is always worrisome.<p>I wonder what the worst case performance is -- if your guess is completely wrong, will it still converge in no worse than O(log(N))? Do you guess only once, at the beginning, or do you keep guessing where to go based on the distribution?<p>If you only guess once, at the beginning, then there&#x27;s probably no risk. But if you keep trying to aim for the wrong target every iteration, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if you get pathological behavior.<p>It would be kind of fun to try to calculate or simulate how bad it can get if you keep making incorrect guesses.')
