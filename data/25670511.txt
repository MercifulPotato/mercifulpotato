I would have sold it all when it reached $10. And if not I would have thought there is no way this thing is worth $100 and would have sold. So there is no way I would have reached $1000, let alone $30,000.<p>The only decisions you should regret are the decisions you could have got right with the information you had at the time. Otherwise it’s like regretting not having picked the right lottery number')
