We don&#x27;t have the MTTF type numbers for pixels like we demand for hard drives.<p>The problem with contrast is more pronounced on my OLED tv than on my HDR LED monitor. I&#x27;ve also noticed on my TV if I watch netflix with standard size subtitles, the brightness overwhelms the lower part of the image on dark TV shows. I suspect this is less of an issue on LED monitors only because the contrast is not so extreme.<p>Again, all anecdotes. I do like OLED though, enough to make it my priority TV feature.')
