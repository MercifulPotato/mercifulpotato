Their high-storage plans go up to 10TB disk at $48.30&#x2F;mo. In my experience their disk performance isn&#x27;t stellar, but for lots of use cases it&#x27;s more than adequate. Note that LetBox explicitly disallows media piracy on their servers (not your use case, but that&#x27;s the context in which a lot of folks seek out high-storage servers). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.letbox.com&#x2F;cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.letbox.com&#x2F;cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=2</a><p>There&#x27;s also WalkerServers. They rent out bare metal servers by the month, going up to 144TB at â‚¬255&#x2F;mo. Their plans are more expensive than LetBox, but you should get better performance since it&#x27;s bare metal, and if you buy your server in the Leaseweb datacenter, torrenting is allowed. The owner conducts a lot of customer service on Reddit and people seem pleased with his services.<p>Finally, for your specific use case, I would suggest considering AWS S3, Backblaze B2, or similar. Local disk space could easily be a limitation for folks looking to self-host image space; I have a friend with multiple TiB of images in Google Photos he&#x27;s looking to move somewhere else. I have 30GiB of photos, which rules out lots of cheap VPS plans. Lots of folks also won&#x27;t spring for more than the cheapest VPS plan they can get, or they&#x27;ll load up your software on an old computer with modest storage. Local storage also makes your users responsible for backups&#x2F;disk failures for some of the most important data they own, and most users really don&#x27;t implement backup well. Putting the photos into a highly-durable, infinitely-scalable, cost-effective object store with push-button backup&#x2F;versioning settings carries a lot of advantages for this sort of project. It doesn&#x27;t have to be either&#x2F;or -- you could support both -- but I definitely suggest supporting object stores.')
