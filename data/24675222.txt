Given enough time, it can just throw people at problems and get there. Notwithstanding the fact that the research and academic works coming out of China, while still facing issues in quality on average, have still been rising in quantity and quality.<p>When the combined US+EU market is less than half the amount of people of your own economy, stumbling upon itself with regulations and inner struggles and disagreements, and you are the single most important builder of things in their world.. I&#x27;m not sure democracy is a prerequisite to be able to achieve domination eventually.<p>Sure, average quality of life still isn&#x27;t on par with the EU or the US.. but then again, they&#x27;ve taken 600 million people out of extreme poverty in the last few decades, they&#x27;re the single biggest current builder of nuclear power plants, they&#x27;re developing their own space agency at a rapid pace, and are perfectly fine increasingly making major US businesses bend to their will (in tech, in sports, in the industry, and in bending America&#x27;s cultural influence in the world through things like Hollywood), and they seriously lock down the innovation and profit so that it circulates internally first and foremost.<p>I&#x27;m not saying all these things for the fun of it: I&#x27;m from the EU and I live in Canada, so I&#x27;m both very much wanting the world to go towards the models that the EU and Canada are trying to achieve (as far as democracies strive to improve themselves, ever-so-slowly sometimes), but I&#x27;m also pretty keenly aware of how small those players actually can be when compared to a behemoth with a very long history, a critical mass, and willing to make any necessary concessions to dominate.<p>You don&#x27;t really need 750 million people when you have 1.6 billion in the first place.')
