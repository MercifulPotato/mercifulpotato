More bodies doesn&#x27;t necessarily equal better product, for sure.<p>Agreed.<p>&gt; They can devote teams of researchers and engineers to topics like CPU side channel attacks, entropy draining in virtualized environments, and other stuff that your average firewall&#x2F;AV admin isn&#x27;t even aware are attack vectors.<p>True. Of course, side channel attacks aren&#x27;t even possible threat vectors on bare-metal&#x2F;non-virtualized&#x2F;single OS&#x2F;tenancy environments. From that perspective, virtualization can be seen as having two primary benefits: potentially higher availability and the cost savings of combining multiple functions onto a single piece of hardware, but if costs were not a concern and all else being equal, separate bare-metal servers will have better isolation.<p>One thing that concerns me is that KPIs at some large cloud providers seem to be focused on creating <i>new</i> features and not fixing bugs, especially security bugs, so there&#x27;s no incentive to do the drudgery of curing security flaws for a developer. It&#x27;s hard and detail-oriented work, which makes me even more concerned when I see a trillion-dollar company that won&#x27;t pay to find about bugs in its own products.<p>Lots of huge companies with tons of money have big security teams. This does not always give the best results, as we&#x27;ve seen.<p>Of course, having great arguments (like this one!) helps in raising awareness and comprehension among the less technical stake holders.
