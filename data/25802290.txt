A bad senior would be annoyed that the choices are questioned. As a leader I tell my &quot;apprentices&quot; to always question me what the reason is for doing something. Being in a leadership position is not just about your pupils progress, it&#x27;s just as much about your own learning. You learn a lot when you have to explain stuff. It can be very humbling when you try to explain in-front of your team, being questioned, and then discover that you where wrong.')
