Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602096928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24711086, text='There&#x27;s a lot here, so I&#x27;ll try to summarize your point and you can tell me if I&#x27;m off.<p>&gt;<i>food, water, shelter, and healthcare are universal human interests.</i><p>I&#x27;m assuming you mean this is in the governments purview as part of promoting the general welfare clause. While I would agree, I can also understand those who do not because they take a more Jeffersonian view that the point of the government is to protect individual rights. At times, I can see where promoting general welfare and protecting individual rights can be at odds. I didn&#x27;t see that specific definition of &quot;healthy representative democracy&quot; so it&#x27;s may be too broad a reach (or I may have just missed it within the thread).<p>&gt;<i>if i lie to you a bunch and you vote me in, i&#x27;m not representing you.</i><p>This feels like a contradiction to the previous point that &quot;voters will kick out politicians&#x2F;administrations that donâ€™t represent their interests well.&quot;. Maybe a lying politician gets to do this once, but after that it&#x27;s the populace&#x27;s job to hold them accountable. The people have a responsibility in a democracy as well. I agree it&#x27;s not easy and opportunists will try to rig the system. Being difficult doesn&#x27;t absolve us of the responsibility. I get the impression we fundamentally disagree that there&#x27;s &quot;zero accountability to the people&quot;. I think there is, but people may just not have the fortitude to do it for a variety of reasons. In many ways, I think the adage of &quot;People get the government they deserve&quot; is true. If you want to tolerate rigged systems or lying politicians, or don&#x27;t want to get actively engaged, what kind of system do you think you deserve?')
