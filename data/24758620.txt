The past couple weeks we have finally started to get inquiries and bookings, with our first guests back arriving in the beginning of November. We&#x27;ve had very few cancellations for our 2021 dates, but we also haven&#x27;t had our normal stream of bookings for 2021â€“more of a pause of 2021 activity.<p>We believe there will be pent-up demand for vacations in 2021 after travel restrictions relax (Maui has had mandatory 14 quarantines in place which end this week). People will have more unused vacation time than normal and quarantine fatigue&#x2F;cabin fever will also increase demand.<p>I do agree that air travel will be the biggest barrier for us. The non-stops from where we live are gone for now, so the shortest travel time has gone from 5h 30m to an 11h 30m red-eye.')
