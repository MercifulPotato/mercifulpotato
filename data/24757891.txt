At that point, why even leave leadership up to the voters? A dictatorship, oligarchy, or plutocracy would be wiser if the public really can&#x27;t determine for themselves what will secure or endanger their freedom.<p>One of the cornerstones of American government is self-governance: the ability of the people to discern, in aggregate, good from bad. If we accept the public&#x27;s ability to vote, we ought to also accept their right to inform a company of <i>someone they perceive to be</i> a bad actor in their midst and boycott said company <i>based on their perception</i>.<p>The public isn&#x27;t always right. We assume, as a matter of American self-governance, that they often are.<p>(We probably shouldn&#x27;t fork the conversation on the topic of white supremacist rape culture, because I&#x27;m guessing from your statement that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe that describes America ;) ).')
