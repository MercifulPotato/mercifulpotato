I recently opened a text editor, copied all the URLs, and closed the tabs.<p>Some of the tabs were PDFs so I downloaded them and saved them. There were 89, averaging about 20 pages (some were books). Rounding up to 90, that&#x27;s about 1800 pages. I read about 33 pages an hour (yeah, I did measure it), that turns out to be 1800 &#x2F; 30 or 60 hours of reading, ignoring the other tabs. I need to hire people to read for me.')
