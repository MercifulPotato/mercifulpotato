Do you want to save energy or privacy? Which is stronger hypothesis P=NP? The continuum hypothesis? The fact that physics can&#x27;t fundamentally integrate relativity or quantum field theory? The ergodic hypothesis? In the spirit of both physics, CS, and math, we are valued by the trust networks who we trust and inform. The failure to integrate means in physical terms we can still create new huge blobs of semantic meaningful value and save energy at the same time by using free distributed cloud v-compute spacetime. You can theorize from any cloud provider Amazon MS Google if they shared info they legally shouldn&#x27;t have inferred for data privacy reasons. Reason over complexity classes.<p>Personally I live near Washington DC, so with a government change, I will have to reassess what side of the issue ethically I should be reasoning in. Save energy? Encourage monopoly? Join government? Join big tech? Seek rents from big tech? I&#x27;m just meditating and creating deferred decision trees for myself postmarked for myself using the &quot;well known&quot; schwartzâ€“zippel lemma and noether&#x27;s theorem so i have self-determination.')
