It’s just a fact.<p>They’ve also never devoted enough care, resources, or money to network architecture and how important availability is (with fairness, they have improved in this area in the last couple of years due to the major iCloud outages they had).<p>Apple doesn’t hire mainstream IT people and cybersecurity people from the enterprise realms. There is a vast amount of talented people and knowledge they simply ignore because the Apple culture is too hip and cool for that.<p>Steve Jobs is primarily the blame for all the above. He treated the departments and any person that cared about enterprise like dirt. Steve Jobs always said Apple is a consumer company. This philosophy has obviously carried on.')
