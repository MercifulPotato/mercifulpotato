MIAB will do automated backups of everything that&#x27;s on the machine, this means that it will use more than double the space on disk (compared to just the space that it would be required to store your email + attachments), that&#x27;s if you choose to store the backups on local disk (but why would you?). The alternatives are either not doing backups (bad!) or storing backups on a different machine using rsync, or on an S3 bucket. Personally I use DigitalOcean Spaces which is S3 compatible, and I store backups from the last 3 days. The Spaces bucket was an additional $5 in my Digitalocean bill. So you should consider the backup storage cost as well.<p>Regarding webmail: MIAB includes Roundcube by default, which is OK on desktop but basically unusable on mobile, so on mobile I just use the built in client that came with my iPhone.<p>Of course you can use whatever webmail client you prefer, you just install it on a different VPS though (because MIAB will pretty much take over the whole VPS for itself; the only thing you can have alongside it on the same VPS, is a purely static website).<p>MIAB also includes Nextcloud [ * ] where you can add an alternative webmail client [1]. In order to install that client you need to unlock the nextcloud admin by executing a script that is included in MIAB [2].<p>[*](in MIAB, Nextcloud is intended to manage calendar+contacts but you can also use it to store files or as an additional webmail client, even though those two use cases are not officially supported by the MIAB devs; this means that, if you have an issue related to storage or webmail, you should seek help from the Nextcloud community, not from the MIAB forums).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.nextcloud.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;mail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.nextcloud.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;mail</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mail-in-a-box&#x2F;mailinabox&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tools&#x2F;owncloud-unlockadmin.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mail-in-a-box&#x2F;mailinabox&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tool...</a>')
