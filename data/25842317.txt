As a visually impaired person with a degenerative condition I want to change that. I firmly believe that these people could become amazing coders precisely because of their disabilities.<p>Nearly every activity that a fully sighted person performs thoughtlessly has to be broken down into a series of very carefully orchestrated steps. I think that this algorithmic pattern of thinking would make for extremely trainable people. Who better to do QA and accessibility testing? And QA and accessibility testing in and of themselves could make a great training ground for any career trajectory.')
