I don&#x27;t hate their community, though.<p>That said, TensorFlow was written by Google in the typical Google Java way. See that bit above where I shit on Google-supplied Java? This also applies to TensorFlow, even though its written in Python.<p>There is just something culturally wrong at Google, and I don&#x27;t know why; Amazon and Microsoft and Netflix and whoever else have donated actually pretty decent code to the FOSS community, and none of it is even a fraction of the trainwreck that Google produces.')
