If it was for example rst, it would be actually useful also for technical and scientific documents in general, which have sometimes need of document internal referencing of arbitraty elements, not only headings. Then of course all the other things Pandoc markdown brings, that are more geared towards finding a syntax for citations and footnotes etc. If all of that is not available either, the use is already quite limited.')
