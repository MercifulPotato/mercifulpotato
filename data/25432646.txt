And it&#x27;s sort of understandable. Imagine you are a police officer called to go to a protest where everyone there hates your guts, calls for you to lose your job, and bad actors instigate confrontation, throw stuff at you, etc. The escalated tensions probably adds way more stress to the officers there and they snap and start doing heavy handed policing because they want the protest to be over so they can go home.')
