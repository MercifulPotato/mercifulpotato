There is still a family of functions operating on the same exact data. All that he has done is throw away the init and require more imports.<p>Given that python is an object oriented language, the correct abstraction for this pseudo-class is... a class.<p>As others have already pointed out, the example would benefit from a refactor that separates concerns but this so-called &quot;functional&quot; approach makes that harder to accomplish if these functions have been peppered throughout the codebase.<p>I&#x27;m tired of people making trivial arrangements to a codebase like this and calling it &quot;functional&quot;, losing most of the OOP benefits of python in the process. Maybe stop rearranging the chairs and get on with sailing the ship.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a little salty today. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
