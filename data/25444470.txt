Basically to switch windows all you gotta use your brain and solve a rubik&#x27;s cube. You also have to memorize a bunch of short cut keys for rotating the cube. Specifically avoided allowing you to use arrow keys or the mouse for this because you lose precious nanoseconds of efficiency. Also no graphics either. The cube is represented by console text in a 3 by 3 grid with letters representing color because all graphics are useless and get in the way of my efficiency. Every command is represented by a very specific rubik&#x27;s cube configuration so you just need to memorize all the problems and solutions.<p>Want to move your cursor 1 space to the right? Solve a rubik&#x27;s cube. I made sure there&#x27;s a short cut keys for every possible solution so 1 key press is all you need to execute any command.<p>This idea is basically to design an interface for people like you and me who totally get it and understand truly what a good interface design is. It&#x27;s also for people who understand that there are no tradeoffs in the UI world and that everything needs to be designed for ruthless efficiency.<p>Have you tried learning chinese? It&#x27;s a hard language to learn how to write but pretty efficient because every freaking word has its own symbol aka shortcut key.<p>I&#x27;m also thinking of creating a keyboard and a programming language written in chinese where every single key you press generates an entire programming language token (written as a single chinese word), because seriously letters and english is overrated just easy learning curve that&#x27;s all.<p>I also agree with you on animations and decorations. Never helped me and neither does any other aesthetic concept in the real world. I don&#x27;t need anything pretty because it&#x27;s not efficient. For example my girl friend. Getting a pretty girl is against human nature nobody wants that because it&#x27;s not logical prettiness only gets in the way of my ruthless efficiency plus it&#x27;s overrated.')
