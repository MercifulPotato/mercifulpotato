You are free to start your own version of AWS and host whatever you&#x27;d like on it. You are free to stand on a street corner and start reading out loud from <i>Mein Kampf</i> if you&#x27;d like. You are even allowed to march the streets waving a nazi or confederate flag. Private people and companies, on the other hand, are under no obligation to help further your speech.')
