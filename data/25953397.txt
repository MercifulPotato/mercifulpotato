Given the choice between a dollar today and a dollar tomorrow, you should always choose a dollar today since you can choose not to spend it. So it&#x27;s strictly better than a dollar tomorrow.<p>The only time I see that it wouldn&#x27;t be true is if there was risk in carrying it - taxes, negative interest rates, or theft. I could see for example a tonne of gold tomorrow being more valuable than a tonne of gold today since you&#x27;d have to deal with storage and security and such.')
