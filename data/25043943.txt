Human is the top predator on this planet,no other animal comes even remotely close. We are hard to hunt, have lots of sneaky ways to avoid danger and cause maximum harm to those who try to use us as food. Personally I think the only reason that could change it would be some global phenomenon that would result in very limited options growing animals. Maybe then we&#x27;d go to making protein bars and animal killing would be a distant memory.')
