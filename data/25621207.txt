From a buffer one can interact with the system and it may show things inline.<p>The REPL, often called a &#x27;Listener&#x27; in Lisp is an explicit dialog with the system, where the dialog is visible and parts of the dialog can be reused and inspected. Also the dialog can be suspended temporarily and we interact with the running code itself in break loops until we resume the original dialog in some way.<p>This usually is the horror for people wanting predictable code - where in an interactive Lisp, one can change code interactively at runtime.')
