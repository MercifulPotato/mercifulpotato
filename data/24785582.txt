My Steam client is configured with with a background download rate cap of 1 MB&#x2F;sec, and just a few minutes ago I noticed it downloading something and looked at the disk write rate, which the client also reports. Much of the time it&#x27;s around 2 MB&#x2F;s, give or take, but it can jump up to 5x, sometimes almost 10x that.<p>So I think you&#x27;re right, something like a network installer slurping down at 1 Gbps could write saturate an SSD, not necessarily even a particularly slowpoke one.')
