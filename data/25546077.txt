Is www.google.com or www.bing.com doesn&#x27;t work on those devices?<p>Why are you putting the blame solely on the devices, completely ignoring the fact that Let&#x27;s Encrypt is an advocacy group whose sole intention is to make non-SSL-based HTTP obsolete?  Keep in mind that HTTP has no reason to ever stop working on such old devices!<p>Noone&#x27;s asking for indefinite support of old software.  What we&#x27;re dealing here is intentional device obsolescence, where the SSL protocol -- entirely optional if all you care about is reading text and watching pictures of cats from random anonymous sources -- is intentionally being used in such a way as to not be backwards compatible, by preemptively removing support for the earlier devices?')
