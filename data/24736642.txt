The US dollar reserve status is a contingent factor however.<p>How do we maintain it? An obvious factor is our military capacity. That means defense spending. Under a capitalist system that also requires a competitive commercial defense sector and also a strong economy capable of sustaining such a sector via tax revenue.<p>Most tax revenue comes from individuals. In an era of mobile capital, corporate taxation is sub-optimal. So the economy&#x27;s health is linked to the prosperity of individuals, in aggregate.
