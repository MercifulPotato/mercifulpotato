Item(by='kabdib', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604426614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24982061, text='For Hayes modems, this wouldn&#x27;t (well, <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i>) have worked, since it requires a one second pause between the last &#x27;+&#x27; and the command. It&#x27;s part of Hayes&#x27; patent IIRC. I believe it was also only processed on the transmitted traffic, not the received.<p>What does a competing and not-wanting-to-infringe-a-patent modem company do? They just don&#x27;t implement the delay, and ignore the direction of the traffic while they&#x27;re at it. Problem solved! (head-to-desk, repeatedly)')
