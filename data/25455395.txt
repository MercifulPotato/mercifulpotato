As for Macs, you get nearly the same benefits as that but now you also get access to the best hardware money can buy, from the cpu right up.  I&#x27;m sure Linux will be ported to Apple Silicon eventually, but one look at the history of Linux even on x86 laptops shows how it will suck with half-finished drivers, shitty UI and terrible touchpad semantics, etc.  Linux will always be a third rate OS for desktops.')
