It does offer a great amount of depth in terms of capabilities for power users, but always refers back to basic UI concepts that can be applied to many different contexts.<p>What truly amazes me though is the stability of the platform. Yes, it&#x27;s great for home recording and casual use, but the same application is used as a core piece in live performances with huge audiences. There&#x27;s not a lot of &quot;consumer&quot; software out there that I would trust with that. Ableton Live is certainly one of those.')
