Are you aware of anything like that?<p>My Answer:\nYou have PeerTube, which you can self-host.<p>&gt; PeerTube is software that you install on a web server. It allows you to create a video hosting website, so you can create your &quot;homemade YouTube&quot;. The difference to YouTube is that it&#x27;s not intended to create a huge platform centralizing videos from the whole world on a single server farm (which is horribly expensive). On the contrary, PeerTube&#x27;s concept is to create a network of multiple small interconnected video hosting providers.<p>- From PeerTube&#x27;s FAQ(verbatim except for a few minor grammar errors)<p>&gt; PeerTube has 3 main adventages:\n    1) An open code (transparency) under a free&#x2F;libre license (ethic, respect and community-driven development);\n    2) A federation of interconnected hosting providers (so more video choices wherever you go to see them);\n    3) Peer-to-peer broadcasting – and therefore viewing – (so no slowing down when a video becomes viral).<p>- From PeerTube&#x27;s FAQ: What are the main advantages of PeerTube?<p>On the specifics of the live streaming features, albeit vague:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinpeertube.org&#x2F;roadmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinpeertube.org&#x2F;roadmap</a><p>Apparently Framasoft(the organization behind PeerTube) is planning to implement the live streaming feature once they hit $60,000 USD in funding. However, keep in mind that this is a new feature that hasn&#x27;t come out yet, and if and when it comes out the first time, it will be a work-in-progress. They are currently below funding goals for step 4 of the roadmap, aka the live streaming feature. Donations may or may not be tax deductible, depending on the jurisdiction in which you live.<p>What is PeerTube:<p>&gt; PeerTube is software that you install on a web server.

It maintains the source code for PeerTube and several other projects. It&#x27;s also based in France(important if you want to send tax-deductible donations to Framasoft).<p>Website on the parent organization: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framasoft.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;association&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framasoft.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;association&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; The Framasoft association is a 1901 not-for-profit association whose character of general interest authorizes a tax deduction. Which shows its willingness to stay an association on a human scale (less than forty members, less than ten permanent staff)\n___________<p>Sorry for the crappy formatting, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to format the information optimally.')
