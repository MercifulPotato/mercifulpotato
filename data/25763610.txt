Plus I started doing more file storage that I was accessing both on desktop and iphone. Certainly the original use case for Dropbox of local sync was amazing and exactly what I needed years ago, but my work&#x2F;life needs have changed over time and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a larger amount of people are falling in to the cloud first category today as compared to when Dropbox originally launched.<p>Back then cloud syncing just made no sense at all because the speeds were pretty bad and inconsistent.<p>Not saying everyone falls into this category, but just pointing out that the market has evolved somewhat from their original position.')
