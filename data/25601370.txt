Item(by='lioeters', descendants=None, kids=[25602234, 25602331, 25601592], score=None, time=1609483009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600922, text='The company was named 任天堂骨牌 (Nintendō Karuta) when it was founded in 1898 to sell a traditional Japanese card game called Hanafuda (meaning &quot;flower cards&quot;).<p>The company name is certainly intended to have semantic meaning, as each character of 任天堂 combines sensibly and logically.<p>The last character 堂 suggests a kind of sacred space, &quot;a hall, temple, or shrine&quot;. The second chatacter 天 means &quot;heaven&quot;; and the first character 任 implies trusting, or leaving things up to, this &quot;heaven&quot;.<p>&gt; The name Nintendo is commonly assumed to mean &#x27;leave luck to heaven&#x27;, but the assumption lacks historical validation; it can alternatively be translated as &quot;the temple of free hanafuda&quot;.

I believe this is also intentional, related to the history of these playing cards in Japan as part of illegal gambling.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hanafuda#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hanafuda#History</a><p>---<p>This historical photo of the original store is wonderful:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nintendo#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Nintendo_1889.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nintendo#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Nintendo_...</a>')
