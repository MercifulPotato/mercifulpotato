Out of curiosity, do you use a kind of wysiwyg (a la qt designer) to make your interfaces, or do you write Python code directly? Coming from JavaFX using scenebuilder to design UIs, l tried Pyside2 some years ago, never managed to find a way to make it work with a wysiwyg the way I am used to with JavaFX. Writing and styling widgets by hand is painfully slow.')
