Excession is definitely NOT an entry point to the series, if there is such a thing. And Consider Phlebas is routinely considered not a great entry point, but people do it anyway because it&#x27;s chronological. But it&#x27;s a bit of a snore and it only barely grazes on Culture and doesn&#x27;t get into any of the meat of the conceit at all, so it sort of turns people off to the series as a whole, I think.')
