Again, I don&#x27;t think these blood tests are good for diagnosing short term triggers, but monitoring your TSH levels after some longer-term controlled lifestyle experiments can be very informative.<p>As far as diagnosing disease, there are many blood tests broadly that one would&#x2F;could run to aid in diagnosing autoimmune diseases, including ANA pattern and titer, DS Antibody, SCL-70 antibody, ANA screen (IFA), SM antibody, Sjogren&#x27;s antibodies, ANCA screen, P &amp; C ANCA titer, rheumatoid factor, CRP, compliment levels (e.g. C3, C4), SED rate, white blood cell counts (neutorphils, lyphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes). Tests for organ function can also be critical in evaluation.<p><i>I don&#x27;t know much about hypothyroidism</i>, but my advice is to do a lot of self-education, reading as much literature as you can about it. Journal your behaviors, habits, stress levels, sleep, and food and identify patterns yourself. You can do this by eliminating certain environmental or dietary factors for four or six months, then do TSH tests again. You have to be careful of changing too many variables at once. I know it&#x27;s a pain in the butt, but desperate times call for desperate measures. You want your disease to stay in a managed state and prevent any immune system issues from spidering into other disorders. If you have these potential warning signs of your immune system starting to crack, my advice is to do everything you can to protect it from reaching additional failure points.')
