During that transition I was also a plumber.<p>The &#x27;simple life&#x27; jobs are also taxing, but just in different ways. Bosses yelling at you to get work done ASAP, union bullshit, and reletivly low pay (unless you own your own business).<p>While there are some days I wish I was doing some head math and watching a lathe make cuts on a electric motor shaft, in the end I&#x27;m happy with where I ended up.<p>Just posted this so you know that the grass isn&#x27;t always greener 100% of the time!')
