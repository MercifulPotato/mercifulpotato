Induction is great for lots of reasons, indoor pollution only being one.<p>The small cheap portable induction units have a number of tradeoffs that are not inherent to induction itself, but are more related to.. being inexpensive and portable.<p>Like the parent here though, we do all of our cooking on a cheap, portable, induction hot plate sitting on top of our gas stove because it is just that much better. I also cannot wait to get a full size version, but this is unfortunately hard when you rent apartments.')
