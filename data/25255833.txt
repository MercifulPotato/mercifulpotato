Item(by='zoidb', descendants=None, kids=[25258685], score=None, time=1606755168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255815, text='&gt; Also, small nit, &quot;find .&#x2F;place-for-pipers -type f -name &quot;piper&quot; | xargs grep -i &#x27;piping&#x27;&quot; wasn&#x27;t accepted due to the filenames being prefixed to the output. I feel like this is one of the benefits of piping it all through a single grep (grep, knowing the context of multiple input files, gives you useful output). Obviously you can massage both solutions to give the others&#x27; text output, but I just felt a little cheated that my response wasn&#x27;t marked correct.<p>Hm, yeah we can probably just search for the filenames and ignore everything else to make it a little more forgiving.')
