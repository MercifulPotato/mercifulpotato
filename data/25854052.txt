Of course this never happens.<p>So you have the Left YIMBYs that can afford these new market priced condos upset and wondering why low income progressives won&#x27;t roll over and let themselves evicted. Maybe wealthy left YIMBYs should focus their activism on redeveloping other areas of cities that wouldn&#x27;t harm the working class and poor?')
