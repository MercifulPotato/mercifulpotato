Facts will continue to come out and be amalgamated into various narratives to suit the various factions.<p>I guess what I really mean to say is that someone seeing that video and thinking, &quot;some of those people were let inside by the Capitol Police&quot; is not the most reckless interpretation of a video clip I&#x27;ve seen in the last twelve months, much less in my lifetime.<p>Now, &quot;I saw that video and therefore it was staged by [Trump&#x2F;Pelosi&#x2F;etc.],&quot; is where it becomes reckless and unjustifiable parroting of trending narratives. Let&#x27;s wait for the investigation, and hope (however naively) that it is thorough and impartial, and that the public receives the full report.<p>Edited to add: I have never seen an American public so ready to be deceived and weaponized against each other as what we&#x27;ve seen with this last, long cycle of increasing tension (which appears to be far from over). And it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess as to who will weaponize that more destructively.<p>So I think your ultimate point is both timely and important. Thank you for making it.')
