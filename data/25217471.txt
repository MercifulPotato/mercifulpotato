Cloudflare requires hcaptcha if you mistype your password a single time when accessing their dashboard. The UX of hcaptcha is not good, especially in a flow where I&#x27;m already fixed on goal (doing something in my dashboard). If I need to stop thinking about dns settings or caching to pick out photos with bicycles, that&#x27;s a really expensive context switch for my brain. And in my experience, you need to do two &quot;pages&quot; to complete the captcha.<p>By comparison, I&#x27;ve been asked to complete recaptcha exactly zero times day to day (perhaps I&#x27;m lucky?). The last time must have been many months ago.<p>It&#x27;s hard to speak to the specific UX qualities of the captcha itself, but I find recaptcha generally less difficult. But a captcha that I don&#x27;t need to complete always wins out over one that I do.')
