If a part of a photo is too dark, the details will be clipped out for your eyes, no matter how much bits they will be encoded with - it will be just too dark.<p>In reality eyes can adjust the &quot;exposure&quot; on the fly because they recieve all the needed information always. But in a displayed digital image this information is already lost - eyes don&#x27;t recieve all these bits, the display doesn&#x27;t send them.<p>In the editor you can adjust the &quot;exposure&quot; for the RAW files too - they have the needed information - but! - it is not a static image, because you are adjusting it, you are sending continuously different information to the eyes.')
