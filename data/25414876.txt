But all abstractions leak under some circumstances.<p>If you have 100 layers of abstractions at any given moment some layer leaks and you&#x27;re constantly fighting the system without being able to understand how the whole thing should work.<p>Language syntax only helps by removing the need for some abstractions by including them in the language.')
