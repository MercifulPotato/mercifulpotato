Item(by='Xylakant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605468875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103956, text='&gt; if a dev simply copied the entirety of someone&#x27;s code and simply renamed some variables, could they claim it&#x27;s their own original work (without worry of legal recourse)? I&#x27;d figure not, in which case, how much of a difference is different enough?<p>This would most definitely not be enough. That would basically make all licenses useless - commercial and noncommercial alike. The MIT license is no different than any other license in that regard.<p>In case of the MIT license, whenever I copy any code (files or parts), I always place a comment right next to the section, pointing to the source of the copy and containing the license of the code&#x2F;copyright marker. Honestly, what’s the cost? My ego doesn’t take a hit from admitting  that I found and adapted something useful. The possible uses of the code are unaffected. License situation is clarified for audits. The original author gets credit for their work. There’s only upsides.')
