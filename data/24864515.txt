Nothing about their model made sense to me personally, and their failure to pivot or iterate seems like a huge business mistake.<p>I&#x27;m just making the point that PG and many other SV founder&#x2F;VC types don&#x27;t feel the need to take another swing at Quibi on Twitter because most companies (good ideas or bad) fail anyway. And if they had succeeded, by 2027 everyone would have collectively re-written history to think that Quibi was a super-obvious idea from the beginning.')
