If you want to get a full experience in any game that requires performance, you&#x27;re not really getting it on the Switch. There&#x27;s even some Switch exclusive games that have pretty significant performance issues, like the Xenoblades remaster that might dip down to 540p even when docked. Really, the only thing that the Switch replaced was the Nintendo 3DS.')
