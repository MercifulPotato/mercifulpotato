Especially those &quot;life hack&quot; ones where people fold their laundry super fast or that kind of thing.  I want to take the time to ingest what I&#x27;m seeing.  If it&#x27;s only enjoyable&#x2F;watchable at 4x speed, maybe it&#x27;s not worth paying attention to to begin with?<p>Of course time-lapses and stuff like that are intentionally sped up, but for something like an instructional video, it&#x27;s going to be challenging to take real meaning from it.<p>In general it seems that people want to see some &quot;neat&quot; thing, click Like, and move onto the next interesting thing.  For me, I don&#x27;t relate.  I like to dive into my interests and invest some real time into them.  Otherwise my perception of the world and the things around me is super shallow.  In fact, when I want information, I usually want text and images, not video&#x2F;audio.<p>Further, I don&#x27;t find it very rewarding to watch those sort of &quot;clickbait&quot; clips.  I understand it can be satisfying in the short term, but I find almost zero need for this type of entertainment.  I sense the primal nature of it and find it unappealing.  I also feel that those primal &quot;entertainment&quot; desires are being exploited for clicks&#x2F;likes&#x2F;advertising, and I prefer to be compensated by greater value than relatively-shallow time-wasting if I am being exploited :)')
