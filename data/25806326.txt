In my initial planning the movement was going to be realistically simulated but I quickly realized it would be difficult to tune the movement the way I wanted for gameplay &#x2F; strategic movement. Doing something that appears less arbitrary than currently would be a good middle ground.<p>I&#x27;m probably not going to add bots. This game is much more pve focused than other io games, and some players are playing for hours in remote sectors alone. That said, I will probably add a couple of drifting &quot;bonus&quot; sectors to attract daring players to a central point.<p>Pirates get stronger as you move in to the &quot;skull&quot; sectors shown on the map. There is no limit to how strong they get (and how much energy &#x2F; score they give):<p>power = max(\n        1,\n        isInNoobSector\n            ? 1\n            : game.rand.nextInt(2) +\n                max((1.5 * (max(sector.coord.x.abs(), sector.coord.y.abs()) - Sector.MAX_D_FOR_NOOBS)).round(), 0));')
