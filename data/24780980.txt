For example, they can&#x27;t binge on chocolate cake or pizza.<p>Instead, rather than using medicine to control their blood sugar, they use a strict diet &amp; exercise.<p>I&#x27;m a type II diabetic, and when I saw my doctor with a good A1c (5.8), she said, &quot;Another doctor wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you were diabetic looking at these numbers. But make no mistake: you can&#x27;t go back to your old ways of eating, or else it&#x27;ll all come back. Those days are over.&quot;<p>My metabolism is permanently broken. The symptoms are in remission, but I&#x27;m by no means cured.')
