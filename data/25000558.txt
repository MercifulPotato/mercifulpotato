What you said is has been my experience too.<p>Here I go about the batteries included vs micro thing.  People pick Flask because it looks approachable but then DIY features in.  The same thing happens with Sinatra+Rails.  If the python ecosystem grows and other communities come in, maybe they will bring their culture and standards in.<p>Take poetry for python.  It&#x27;s basically, &quot;hey ... cargo&#x2F;yarn&#x2F;mix&#x2F;bundler all kind of figured out these ergonomics&quot;.  Poetry&#x27;s &quot;why&quot; section in the README really resonated with me.  Cross pollination of ideas across tribes is _good_.<p>But then, I&#x27;m biased&#x2F;blub-paradox of course.  And it&#x27;s definitely in line with the productivity&#x2F;DSLs&#x2F;rapid vs types&#x2F;verbosity&#x2F;slower modes discussion.')
