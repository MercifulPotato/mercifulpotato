But any adoption of his ideology into the modern alt-right, IDW, or nationalist populist movements currently in vogue are also firmly recuperation. Mishima was absolutely right-wing, but also would find no common ground with e.g. Quilette (at least nominally an extremely pro-Enlightenment, pro-capitalist, pro-West line), the materialist and populist aspects of Trumpism, or the crassness of the alt-right.<p>A quote from <i>Spring Snow</i> comes to mind:<p><i>&quot;Your slow-witted friends—with their sentimentality, their vicious narrow-mindedness that condemns as effeminate anyone who is not like themselves, their harassment of the underclassmen, their fanatical worship of General Nogi... you with all your sensitivity will be seen cheek-by-jowl with these people when they stop to think about our times in years to come. You see, this is the easiest way to establish the essence of our era — to take the lowest common denominator. Once the churning water has settled to a calm surface, you can see the rainbow oil slick floating there. And that’s the way it will be. After we’re all dead, it will be easy to analyze us and isolate our basic elements for everyone to see. And of course this essence, the thought that is the foundation of our era, will be considered quite benighted a hundred years from now. And you and I have no way of escaping the verdict, no way to prove that we didn’t share the discredited views of our contemporaries. And what standard will history apply to that outlook? What do you think? The thoughts of the geniuses of our age? Of great men? Not at all. Those who come after us and decide what was in our minds will adopt the criterion of the uncritical thought patterns of your friends on the kendo team. In other words, they’ll seize upon the most primitive and popular credos of our day. You see every era has always been characterized solely in terms of such idiocies.&quot;</i>')
