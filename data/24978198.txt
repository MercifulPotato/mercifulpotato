In a poor, extremely overpopulated country with high rates of overcrowding and very low hygiene standards, coupled with rampant unemployment and economic distress, anyone could have only expected the situation to worsen. And it did - the country&#x27;s GDP shrunk by almost a quarter and cases continued to pile up... until they didn&#x27;t. The number of active cases miraculously peaked mid-November and have been in a healthy downward trend since. While developed countries like the UK seem to have their number of active cases shoot up exponentially, many states in India are experiencing a net decrease in cases to very safe levels. Even infamously overcrowded states like Uttar Pradesh are displaying impressive levels of recovery.<p>One has to reckon there must be something more to it than just government interventions and change in attitudes.')
