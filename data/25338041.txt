If the subsidies stopped, the companies would go bankrupt. Their assets would be sold to another company, likely at a price less than the debt. The new company could therefore have a lower debt burden, and wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need the subsidies to provide the same level of service. The subsidies are stopping the market from efficiently allocating capital.')
