Something really clicked when I saw a log with my name on it.  It showed everything I’d been doing and it was right in front of me <i>and also someone else</i>: the IT tech with whom I was working.<p>I was getting help debugging something (package manager barfing on the org’s wildcard MITM SSL cert) and the inanity of the tech scrolling through everything I’d done that day in such detail was spine chilling.<p>Deep packet inspection put everything from command line args to Google search terms at their fingertips.  It felt grubby.<p>My org requires that I install their SSL cert which made the logs more detailed than Brown’s.  That’s certainly a pretty high level of creepiness.  But even without SSL DPI when the org has control over the network and at least one website using your identity then it’s trivial to correlate the application layer <i>userid</i> all the way down to your network access, including AP location.<p>If they outsource to Gmail or Outlook there’s usually still an org controlled single sign on that captures your identity.<p>I love the accessible way in which this report is written.  \nWhile it’s specific to Brown it summarizes the generic surveillance patterns of many employers and education orgs.  We all know these programs exist but it’s not until one experiences them first hand that one realizes how desperately creepy they are.')
