And I recommmend  everyone who downplays it to watch &quot;The social dilemma&quot;.<p>There are a few aspects which are worrying:<p>- Social pressure to be connected constantly increases for children below 14 years.<p>- Sites like TikTok, Reddit, Twitter, etc. are designed to be addictive. Children at such a young age do not have the same level of self control like you.<p>- The longer kids spend time on these platforms, the smaller their bubble gets where they live in.<p>I understand that as a good parent you can try to explain such things and guide them. But many won&#x27;t.<p>Recently I was invited to a school meeting about screen time. I was shocked at some recommendations, for example, age = hours of screen time per week. Also many parents trust tablets and phones way more than desktops. This also worries me, because arguably there are more ways to be creative on desktops.<p>I also spent endless hours playing video games when I was young and chatting about them on forums and irc. But social media is on a whole other level and I think most people do not even realize it.')
