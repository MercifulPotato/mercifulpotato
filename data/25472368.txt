If you&#x27;re putting an expensive satellite in orbit for 5,10 years, the cost of the processors is insignificant compared to everything else.<p>The real problem is that we don&#x27;t have good solutions for improving the performance of rad-hard designs, so we&#x27;re stuck with older, larger process sizes that limit what can be implemented. Look at the lengths involved in getting A* to run on Curiosity, and you see just how limiting the hardware is. Everyone, Nasa especially, wants more compute available.<p>In low earth orbits and shorter mission durations, you can get away with redundant hardware instead of rad-hard. Most of the damage done by radiation is upsets, so you can reboot the affected hardware and keep going. But on an unprotected design some of the damage can be permanent, and thus redundancy alone isn&#x27;t enough for longer&#x2F;farther missions.')
