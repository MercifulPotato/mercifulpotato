One&#x27;s motivation for setting a default matters. If you&#x27;re acting in good faith and selecting a default because you genuinely believe (and&#x2F;or have data to show) that it&#x27;s what all but a small group of outliers choose then there&#x27;s no issue. If you&#x27;re acting in bad faith and selecting a default to shape behavior or to get a particular outcome then you&#x27;re abusing your position of (relative) power as a decider for other people.<p>&gt; Second, it should be the default that the status quo is a bad thing.<p>The author wants this default changed because he doesn&#x27;t like the status-quo. Look, I don&#x27;t like it either but assuming that people don&#x27;t like the current state of things in literally every single aspect of life unless stated otherwise compared to &quot;I want to change X,Y,Z.&quot; is way off base.')
