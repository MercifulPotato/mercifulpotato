I can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s better to quit sooner as to not waste the companies time (and avoid suffering more), or if I should give it some more time. My team&#x27;s work seems super boring, I&#x27;m not interested in the tech we use, the setup process has been a shit-show, and I&#x27;m feeling zero motivation.<p>I&#x27;ve mostly worked for startup to mid sized companies in the past, but I decided I&#x27;d try to do things differently by cramming  leetcode and chasing that fat FAANG pay check. Now I&#x27;m kicking myself, this is what happens when you follow money over passion. The silly thing is I&#x27;m fine financially, yet I lusted after a job with technology I&#x27;m not interested in working on just for the lure of the almighty dollar.')
