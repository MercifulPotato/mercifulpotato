IF I release code as &quot;BSD with modifications&quot; people will look at it with suspect eyes.<p>The effect I want to have is NOT to prevent large companies from using my code. In fact I want to encourage them to use it, but to also publicly mention me along with its use, which would be very valuable to career-building and job seeking. That way, when writers of open source code aren&#x27;t offered jobs by the companies that use that code, at least they gain high visibility for other companies to want to hire them.')
