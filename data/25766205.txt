I assume they have pretty much almost all always been ARM. Please correct me if I&#x27;m misinformed. That hasn&#x27;t factored into desktop&#x2F;laptop considerations in the past. Currently, it seems to only factor into Apple&#x27;s plans for unifying their OS X and iOS stack.<p>ARM is growing in servers, but AMD is as well[0]. It&#x27;s not clear though how either smartphone or server architecture will affect desktop&#x2F;laptop purchasing for consumers en masse.<p>Of course if we&#x27;re talking about 2025-2030, I&#x27;m sure any predictions I make are a roll of the dice, at best. But right now I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough momentum of any players to have absolute certainly about 2025 and beyond. There is a lot of inertia with x86 in desktop&#x2F;laptop, and so far Apple&#x27;s Macbook Air&#x2F;Pro and Mac Mini are the only high performing options on ARM.<p>I <i>like</i> AMD but I&#x27;ll be happy to see any technological progress that makes significant improvements to our quality of life.<p>Anecdote City:<p>Just five years ago I didn&#x27;t consider laptops viable for gaming, and now I do most of my gaming on one. The Macbooks with M1 seem like they are capable of some level of gaming, but not &quot;max setting&quot; 1080p gaming, so it&#x27;s not yet an option for someone like me to switch. But when I&#x27;m working, I do most of that on a powerful but very quiet desktop. The M1 chip would not improve my quality of life on my desktop because the efficiency of the chip won&#x27;t really change anything for me. There&#x27;s no compelling reason to swap out of my custom built machine to a Mac Mini.<p>Anecdotes are very personal. And so are computers. For many consumers where an M1-based machine work, the benefits are all but lost on them anyway, for a variety of reasons. They don&#x27;t make decisions based on CPU efficiency - just what they are used to and what features they need and want. If a feature is really life-changing <i>for that particular person</i> they might be OK with change, e.g. switching out operating systems.<p>For a developer, it&#x27;s either easy to think about switching because you know everything is cross-platform, or it&#x27;s perhaps impossible to switch because you use exclusive software.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;computing&#x2F;318217-amd-arm-both-increased-their-server-market-share-in-q3-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;computing&#x2F;318217-amd-arm-both-in...</a>')
