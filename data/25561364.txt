Solar and wind are getting cheaper every year and will decisively beat fossil fuels on a dollar per watt basis eventually.<p>I believe we need to go faster than what is economically feasible because according to the IPCC we are on track to a +4C world by 2100 where a +2C change will already lead to catastrophic consequences for civilization.<p>Government regulation and individual altruism is necessary, but not sufficient, to solve the emissions problem.
