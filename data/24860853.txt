Item(by='DenisM', descendants=None, kids=[24861055], score=None, time=1603388773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859905, text='&gt; You still charge the pack in series<p>I understand that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done, but can we charge faster if we DECIDE NOT to charge in series? I take it the answer is no?<p>Imagine a series of 14 cells. I could charge them as a whole, but there is normally some limit on how much power I can pump into it. Now suppose that I disassembled the series and now I have 14 cells that I can charge independently before re-assembling them back. If I did that, would I gain anything? If nothing else this should prevent unbalanced charging, reducing overall heat of the pack and allowing higher current overall?<p>I can see that some packs advertise 5a charge current and other packs of the same capacity offer 10a or even 15a. Wonder why is there such difference.')
