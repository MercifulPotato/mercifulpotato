So it sounds like, in addition to secrecy, it&#x27;s the audio that&#x27;s at issue; a pure video recording wouldn&#x27;t fall under this law even if done without knowledge or consent.<p>The opinion itself is here[2]. In fact the first two sentences of the opinion mention that expectation of privacy is irrelevant to this case:<p>&gt; Massachusetts, like other states concerned about the threat to privacy that commercially available electronic eavesdropping devices pose, makes it a crime to record another person&#x27;s words secretly and without consent.  But, unlike other  concerned  states,  Massachusetts  does  not  recognize  any  exceptions  based  on  whether  that  person  has  an  expectation  of  privacy in what is recorded.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malegislature.gov&#x2F;Laws&#x2F;GeneralLaws&#x2F;PartIV&#x2F;TitleI&#x2F;Chapter272&#x2F;Section99" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malegislature.gov&#x2F;Laws&#x2F;GeneralLaws&#x2F;PartIV&#x2F;TitleI&#x2F;Cha...</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ca1.uscourts.gov&#x2F;pdf.opinions&#x2F;19-1586P-01A.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ca1.uscourts.gov&#x2F;pdf.opinions&#x2F;19-1586P-01A.pdf</a>')
