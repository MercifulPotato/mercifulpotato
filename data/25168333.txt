Graphistry looks really slick and interesting. On thing I&#x27;m curious about: how do you compare Graphistry with OmniSci and similar GPU-based solutions? You seem to focus on a niche - graph visualizations. That&#x27;s one differentiator I can tell. Do other solutions support graphs too? If so, how do you compare Graphistry with them?<p>Btw, if you referred to the 1M-row example I posted - we actually can do much larger than that. A recording of a visualization with 1B reddit comments is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ccES97ni_vI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ccES97ni_vI</a> Behind the scenes we do indexing with Citus, which is a distributed version of PostgreSQL. Our cloud budget can only afford hosting a small demo 24&#x2F;7 so that&#x27;s why. Also, because OP talked about loading data into the web vis tools - 1M can already break many web tools out there.<p>You can tell our target use case is different than yours, and than OmniSci&#x27;s. It&#x27;s great to see solutions being developed in a one-size-doesn&#x27;t-fit-all world.')
