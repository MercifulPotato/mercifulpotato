Dispel any notion that you may be a “cheap” person for buying used by the fact that it is infinitely better for the environment.<p>Often time people will say that it is not worth the time to resell something less than $10 (time to meet a buyer&#x2F;shop an item), but that’s because the actual costs of trashing it are externalized. Even if you don&#x27;t throw it away and just store it in a closet, you&#x27;re creating demand for the manufacturing of new product that will all eventually be trashed. The longer you hoard it the lower the value—and thus re-usability—it holds.<p>There should also be laws that guarantee the right to transfer warranties so that manufacturers cannot disincentivize the second hand market.')
