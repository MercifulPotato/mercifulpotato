The pandemic drove a mass social experiment in\nwhich half of all paid hours were provided from home between May and October 2020. Our survey\nevidence says that about 25 percent of all full work days will be supplied from home after the\npandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We provide evidence on five mechanisms\nbehind this persistent shift to working from home: diminished stigma, better-than-expected\nexperiences working from home, investments in physical and human capital enabling working\nfrom home, reluctance to return to pre-pandemic activities, and innovation supporting working\nfrom home. We also examine some implications of a persistent shift in working arrangements:\nFirst, high-income workers, especially, will enjoy the perks of working from home. Second, we\nforecast that the post-pandemic shift to working from home will lower worker spending in major\ncity centers by 5 to 10 percent. Third, many workers report being more productive at home than\non business premises, so post-pandemic work from home plans offer the potential to raise\nproductivity as much as 2.4 percent.</i>')
