I hope we can find an argument to use against Apple.<p>However, I think you are misremembering the MS case. As I recall from the time, a lot of that case hinged on the fact that MS was a software maker, not a hardware maker. So &quot;the market&quot; was defined as &quot;all PCs,&quot; and a lot of what got MS in trouble was leveraging their dominant market position with Windows to force PC manufacturer to pay them license fees even for computers that didn&#x27;t have Windows pre-installed.<p>Since Apple makes their own hardware, the situation is not really analogous to the big MS case. As far as I can tell, Apple doesn&#x27;t seem to be leveraging their market position (in any market) to force suppliers to pay Apple even when Apple isn&#x27;t involved. That is, they aren&#x27;t demanding any percentage of payment to Epic on non-iOS devices, right? So that&#x27;s the center of the MS antitrust case with no obvious parallel.<p>As far as imagining, I think it&#x27;s really easy to imagine more direct parallels with Epic&#x27;s case. Sony makes their own gaming hardware and exerts tight control over the PlayStation sales channel, including demanding a large cut of both initial sales and IAP. Microsoft makes their own gaming hardware and exerts tight control over the Xbox sales channel, including demanding a large cut of both initial sales and IAP. One question that has come up in court already is why Epic is fighting against Apple on this, but not Sony or Microsoft. I think it&#x27;s a good question.<p>Look, I&#x27;ve said repeatedly: I think Apple is too big. I believe something needs to be done, and maybe the iOS App Store is a good place to start. But I don&#x27;t think Epic&#x27;s case is any good at all, and I&#x27;m not sure there is a strong case against the iOS App Store other than: &quot;we need to do something, and this annoys me.&quot; Which... I guess we just need to make that sound better.')
