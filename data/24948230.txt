A real whiteboard is a toy problem where you have to use an algorithm or a data structure, write a few test cases and some code on the board and explain why&#x2F;how you did it, not some rote learning exercise.<p>At the senior band they shouldn&#x27;t even be used, if the candidate is coming from a reputable company. But at the college level what else are you going to interview applicants about? You know everyone has done an algorithm class.')
