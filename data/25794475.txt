Those things seem essential for maintaining anything, long-term.  (cf. the &quot;Anna Karenina principle&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anna_karenina_principle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anna_karenina_principle</a> ), for families or cultures that last across many generations.)<p>(Edit:  to clarify that:  Tolstoy said something like &quot;All happy families are alike, and all miserable families are miserable in their own way&quot;. I think there is much to that: multigenerational unselfish service to others, in a widening circle, brings greater sustainability and peace. Seeing what families&#x27; and&#x2F;or cultures&#x27; traits allow them to persist over time is interesting.)<p>From the political side of this (also relevant), things might seem distressing now, but it can be OK. Some more thoughts:<p>1) Honesty, the US Constitution, and the rule of law seem much more important than other policies, even ones we care about deeply (per some of my Church&#x27;s scriptures, such as D&amp;C98). Let&#x27;s pray for our country&#x2F;ies!<p>2) Jesus Christ said &quot;love your enemies&quot;, &amp; more ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;nt&#x2F;matt&#x2F;5.3-10,44" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;nt&#x2F;matt&#x2F;5.3...</a> [churchofjesuschrist.org] ).\n      (And: &quot;By their fruits ye shall know them&quot;: Matt 7:11-21;\n      and see D&amp;C52: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;dc-testament&#x2F;dc&#x2F;52.14-19#11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;dc-testamen...</a> [churchofjesuschrist.org] .)\n      This means treating others with respect, for starters, and the way you would want (or they would want) to be treated.<p>3) Please, along with seeking wisdom &amp; kindness, let&#x27;s try to get\n      info and news from reliable, trustworthy sources. (Many; refs avail.)<p>4) Trust is earned by (trustworthy, good, uplifting) behavior over time, not just promises &amp; piles of words.<p>5) We all can learn, help &amp; encourage each other, grow &amp; be better if we keep trying.<p>I deeply believe, with some reasons, that the US Constitution and some other good things will continue to be in place in the long run, in spite of difficulties.')
