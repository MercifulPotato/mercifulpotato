But I do think that people should have the option to stand &amp; be accounted for, and one of the most important places to do that is in supporting, refusing, or outright censoring others. Government never had the option before of letting us chip in, letting us voice our support or distaste or alarm. Particularly the popular, the famous, those given the megaphone: they should be subject, real-time, regularly, to our accounts. And hopefully, our own accounts over time help us better determine who we were, where we were right, where we were wrong. So we can correct the record, keep becoming more perfect selves, as we try to head &amp; govern towards our more perfect worlds.')
