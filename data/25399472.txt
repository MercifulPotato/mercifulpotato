For example, I am personally skeptical of the notion of &quot;number of defects per release&quot; and want to see an exploration of &quot;amount of time spent on defects per release&quot;.<p>Science doesn&#x27;t tell us anything (that would be authority or religion), and it doesn&#x27;t prove things. It is a process that can assist us in logically determining what is NOT true about a cause-effect relationship to the point where we can make more accurate and practical predictions about those causes and effects. More experiments refine the current beliefs.')
