As a thought experiment, imagine a game which has only single player and LAN multiplayer (Local Area Network), where you have to physically connect computers to each other. Games used to be played like that decades ago, and today we have PCs that are <i>much</i> more mobile - notebooks and laptops. As far as I know, LAN has super good network latency and it could work without lag compensation code. Didn&#x27;t DooM work like that? Also Quake before QuakeWorld.<p>You don&#x27;t have to lecture me about the practicality of releasing a game that has LAN only multiplayer, or that people have jobs, kids and responsibilities. I get that.')
