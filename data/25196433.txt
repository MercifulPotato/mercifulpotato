The marxist narrative seems to be a social practice more than an established theory (and I get it, it&#x27;s great to have a reason to gather under the same banner, I did this for some time).\nOn this topic, the pamphlet &quot;Militancy: highest stage of alienation&quot; offers some good points.<p>I live in France and many old classic &#x27;marxianists&#x27; I know have come to despise the unread and uncultured new generation. Tell a young &quot;marxist&quot; what Das Kapital says of e.g. immigration and watch them decompose before your eyes...\nAnyway, no judgement here, just a personal observation.')
