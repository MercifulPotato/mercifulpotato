It has its own unique features, such as dynamic arrays.<p>Second, I&#x27;m taking advantage of UniVerse features where they make sense.  When I do this I document it since the code only has a portion of the solution.  So far, I&#x27;ve done these for an alternate version of day 4 and for day 7.  In particular, I used a UniVerse file in place of a hash table for day 7.')
