The EFF makes inconvenience in pursuit of privacy palatable. This is profitable for the technology sector from which--surprise!--the EFF&#x27;s support originates.<p>This model doesn&#x27;t work because knowledgeable people have a vested interest in what they know. Sometimes this presents a conflict of interest. But often it&#x27;s just experts converging. (Other times, you&#x27;re missing most of the debate.)<p>&gt; <i>Until this impeccably consistent 1000 batting average</i><p>America produces <i>lots</i> of think-tank literature. I&#x27;d be surprised if more than one in five hundred proposals see light of day.')
