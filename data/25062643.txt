Most batteries&#x27; voltage are &lt;5 volts in default configurations. You can move the voltage boost&#x2F;serial circuitry segment to the engine area. It will waste a lot of material and create redundant wiring but the overall structural voltage will be low. Low voltage does not mean it would not catch fire however.')
