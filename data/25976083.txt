I go back and forth on whether I agree or disagree.<p>For example, once an application becomes sufficiently complex, I&#x27;ve found ORM&#x27;s to be more of a hindrance. The abstraction gets leaky and I end up having to tune custom queries to get around some pathological edge case.<p>That said - most of my experience is with Rails and a lot of the implicit nature of it is problematic. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve not had this experience with Laravel.<p>Which one is right? I dunno. Lately though, writing sizable web applications in Golang is working out well so I guess I&#x27;ll keep doing that.')
