Even if he&#x27;s uploading elsewhere he&#x27;s tailoring he newer stuff to the YT rules so he&#x27;s not discussing manufacturing as much.  Which is stupid when you consider that so much of the stuff he deals with is historical curiosities from over a century ago and incremental manufacturing innovations of the industrial revolution was what spurred the creation of a lot of the stuff he deals with.')
