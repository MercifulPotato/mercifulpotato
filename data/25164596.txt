There is no need to transfer data through PCI to show it on screen - there is a graphics queue that has this as its main purpose. You can use compute queue results in it and do all necessary calculations directly on the GPU. This type of task can benifit greatly from doing FFT on GPU. VkFFT can be append FFT to the user command buffer (list of commands), which can be then followed by additional user commands, like scaling, correcting, etc.<p>AFAIK, virtualization software right now has no or very limited  access to the GPU, so no extensive graphics can be done through it.')
