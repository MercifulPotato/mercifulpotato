Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605161510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25063295, text='Yes, I should have defined my terms, sorry.<p>To me, the vote count is not the result. The result is one of A won, B won, or that there is a draw. So if the vote count ends up 1 to 0 or 1000 to 0, A still wins, so the 999 votes don&#x27;t really matter.<p>In the 1000 to 999 case, yes, everyone whose candidate lost could have stayed at home. But everyone whose candidate won had to come and vote, otherwise there would have been a draw and their candidate would have lost (or at least there would have been a draw).<p>Also, to be clear, all that I&#x27;m describing is more of an emotional argument - analyzing whose vote counts in an election or not is better done through game thelry. If you take the reasoning I laid down further, it sort of breaks down, and it only &#x27;works&#x27; retroactively anyway. But I think it captures the feel of what it means for your vote to matter pretty decently.<p>I would bet that people who voted Biden in Georgia or Pensylvania in last week&#x27;s elections feel that their personal vote was much more important than people who did the same in NYC do.')
