One day, I asked Jeremy what he was working on, and he said he was writing some Prolog to check some hypothesis, and he invited me over to have a look.<p>Really, he was writing a complex rule matching engine (behind the scenes lazily constructing a DFA that operated over experiment observations instead of characters) in Python, to be able to sort sets of observations and contexts into those that fit a hypothesis and those that didn&#x27;t, as part of some Bayesian inference.<p>But, it was easiest to think of the experiments observations as a facts database and his complex hypotheses and complex contexts as Prolog rules.  So, in this case, Prolog was a mental tool, not a programming tool, and he ended up implementing a tiny tiny subset of a Prolog engine that used Python object constructors instead of Prolog syntax.')
