I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t apparent. You even note how he isn&#x27;t politically correct. You don&#x27;t understand how people don&#x27;t like that? Or do you not understand that people don&#x27;t think leaders should be tweeting out their random thoughts like an average person? You aren&#x27;t being downvoted because echo chamber, you&#x27;re being downvoted for either trolling or being dense.<p>But if that doesn&#x27;t do it we can see things like:<p>- Making fun of a disabled person<p>- Saying Mexico is &quot;not sending their best, but their worst&quot; i.e. rapists and drug dealers.<p>- &quot;Grab &#x27;em by the pussy&quot;<p>- Calling people dumb, ugly, or other demeaning terms on national television. Including world leaders.<p>- Hanging out with Epstein.<p>- Having difficult times answering softball questions like &quot;Do you denounce White Nationalism?&quot; Just say yes. Not &quot;I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;re talking about&quot; not &quot;Who?&quot; Just say &quot;I don&#x27;t support White Nationalists.&quot; Full stop. Could even say &quot;I don&#x27;t support Nazis.&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t support the KKK.&quot; But just blabbing on makes people think he&#x27;s dodging the question and not honest. He does this on many things, even when it is clear he isn&#x27;t lying which makes people uncomfortable with him.<p>I can provide sources for all these things and many more, but it is pretty easy to find and all these things have made the national coverage many times over the last year so it is assumed that you&#x27;re aware. What I don&#x27;t understand is how you don&#x27;t understand how someone might be offended by any single one of these events.')
