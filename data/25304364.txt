I interviewed at a few FAANGs and I didn&#x27;t have what Id call a good experience. Neither resulted in an offer. To even prepare for them was a monumental time investment. I tried it and now I can have an informed opinion on the subject. Id rather have a life than drill for random interview questions.<p>Side note: I have yet to personally hear or read anything about why its so great to work at one of these places where someone DOES NOT mention the money. Frankly, were it not for the money Id have never even considered interviewing at these places at all. I have come to the opinion that if it&#x27;s just money, there are other more tangible ways to invest my time that will result in money. Drilling For Interviews as a money accumulation seems to me a bit like heading to the casino on the 28th of the month because you&#x27;re short a few bucks for rent.')
