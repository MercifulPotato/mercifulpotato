Rather, the GAO in its report said making the comparisons was too difficult to obtain meaningful results [...]<p>As an outsider from Europe, let me try.<p>1. It always seemed to me that the litigious nature of doing business in the US must be costly to society. The thinking of &quot;If anything ever happens to you, someone owes you money&quot;.  Lawyers are needed in anything of consequence, and it leads to lots of overhead, distraction and unnecessary work to avoid the possibility of being liable for anything.<p>2. Then there is corruption. The US ranks lower than most european countries on corruption (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corruption_Perceptions_Index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corruption_Perceptions_Index</a>). The article hints at that, mentioning &quot;politicizing&quot; of infrastructure projects. That also costs money to society.<p>3. Then there is lack of competition. Because antitrust laws have not been enforced for decades in the US (not anywhere else too btw), I suspect that big infrastructure projects are getting distributed among a few large companies, who don&#x27;t actually compete; they&#x27;ll all make good money and pay their C-level execs well.<p>There may be other factors like healthcare costs, and unions adding to costs, etc, but those seem to be a result of the above, rather than a root cause.')
