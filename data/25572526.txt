Having personally done house shopping in Houston, the absolute cheapest houses available were about $140k and you had to drive 30-45 minutes out of downtown to get there. The source for the $141k figure is a linked PDF that is no longer available.<p>Additionally, Houston is huge in terms of landmass. Look at housing prices for the vast majority of the people who actually commute to the Houston city center and it&#x27;d be massively higher. A Simpsons style house and yard that&#x27;s &quot;in the loop&quot; could easily be a million dollars in Houston. I know people with smaller houses and smaller yards whose homes are nearly a million.')
