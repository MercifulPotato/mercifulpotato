Getting Linux to run on the M1 already works... it&#x27;s ARM Linux. It already runs on a VM on the M1 unmodified. I suspect we&#x27;ll see Linux booting on M1 hardware within 6 months, likely less.<p>What is going to be a much bigger struggle is getting the drivers for all the various other bits of the architecture working properly. The GPU is the biggie, but networking drivers, power management, audio drivers... the DSP, etc etc.<p>All of the the things which are going to be difficult to get right on the M1 were an uphill battle on x86 as well. And no, Nvidia never provided documentation for their GPUs, it was a long time before we had good graphics support on Linux. Even audio drivers were a mess. Wifi modems were problematic well into the 2010s.<p>Most hardware makers still don&#x27;t document hardware features, the good ones provide binary drivers, and plenty of others rely on known interfaces so they work with older drivers.')
