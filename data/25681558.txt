Why write the inefficient algorithm when you remember the efficient one, and it&#x27;s no more effort?<p>But if an optimization will imply excess complexity or effort, and you aren&#x27;t sure it&#x27;s needed, it&#x27;s premature. Worrying about load when you have 3 users is almost assuredly premature. Not to say you shouldn&#x27;t ask yourself when building &quot;what happens if I get a bunch of users, and are there easy decisions that barely cost me any effort now, but which will allow this to scale easier later, such as writing things with minimal shared state, etc etc&quot;, but once you have optimization design&#x2F;implementation choices that are going to noticeably delay launch...it&#x27;s premature to select them.')
