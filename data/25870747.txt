It&#x27;s just a 128-bit identifier. It&#x27;s &quot;compatible with UUID&quot; only in the sense that both are 128 bits wide, but this scheme doesn&#x27;t have the structure of a UUID.<p>To summarize the scheme, a 128-bit id is generated by concatenating:<p><pre><code>  - 48 bits timestamp (milliseconds since UNIX epoch)\n  - 80 bits of random data\n</code></pre>\nThese ids have the property that they&#x27;re ordered by generation time (ids generated at the same millisecond are ordered randomly). The result can then be encoded in base 16 or base 62 to make it URL-compatible.<p>By the way, encoding timestamps into an id is not always desirable. It has some privacy implications, since now you can tell from the id when the resource was created. If this corresponds with user activity (e.g. a user filling out a form or uploading an image) having this information encoded in a URL is possibly undesirable.')
