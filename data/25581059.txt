Those two are not the same thing.</i><p>This is basically what I said in my first comment above: it&#x27;s always technically possible, but is it practically possible. One needs a certain small amount of economic support to continue any project (no matter how small) these days. Whether it&#x27;s feasible via donations&#x2F;etc. or whether some kind of commercial setup is required isn&#x27;t really super-relevant. The only question here is: if it&#x27;s the former, can the income support employing devs to work on it, or can voluntary developer contributions maintain the project long term (for which you typically need a large community, with which you typically get further scaling &amp; cost concerns).<p>It&#x27;s notable also that Flow is not open source, so Opera is actually a very good comparison here (and much of the above donation&#x2F;volunteer-based thoughts are not options here).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ekioh.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;#partners" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ekioh.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;#partners</a>')
