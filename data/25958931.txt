I&#x27;ve never seen a job posting for a Solutions Architect - Professional offering even north of $200k, much less $300k.<p>Typical seems to be between $130k-$170k.  And nation-wide, the 90th percentile is $200k.<p>It seems like $160k cash plus stock options is a very good salary, even with some assumed growth factored in.')
