I may end up doing this in the future for insanely complicated scenarios. Otherwise, I do a lot of optimization behind the scenes for loading the video frames (I&#x27;ve made my own PRORES-lookalike format), while applying all effects on the GPU.<p>If I will end up implementing this, I will also allow for a Refresh footage button :P')
