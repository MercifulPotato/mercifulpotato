I dont go there (and I assume pay a premium) because I dont like places that treat customers as cattle, and would happily pay a few cents extra for a shopping experience that hasn&#x27;t had every ounce or humanity stripped from it. Granted I&#x27;m in the minority and it&#x27;s hard to even find places that treat their customers like people anymore.')
