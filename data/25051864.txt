I do something like this privately, or did until earlier this year, when I stopped because it (a) was making it hard for me to read people&#x27;s comments rather than surveil threads for specific tags and (b) really drove me to invest time in tagging people, which is unproductive since I know so little about the people commenting here and really have no business bucketing them.')
