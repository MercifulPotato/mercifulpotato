People expect their app or service to keep working at almost any scale. Disabling an app that hits a threshold sounds terrible, because most peoples&#x27; apps _benefit_ from more (legit) activity and they are delighted to pay the extra fees if things just continue to work.<p>For people who are inexperienced or don&#x27;t give it much thought, just waiving their overage fees creates a really nice experience. We&#x27;ve had multiple instances of people asking why their bill is so high and being relieved&#x2F;excited when we explained it and made it go away. People love when we&#x27;re responsive to problems.')
