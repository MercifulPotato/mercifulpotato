Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=[25450394], score=None, time=1608161601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449717, text='&gt; support Mozilla&#x27;s mission and Firefox development.<p>That&#x27;s the rub here. Mozilla&#x27;s mission is a much larger scope than just Firefox. Some people want to support Firefox, but don&#x27;t want to donate to Mozilla&#x27;s mission.  One such reason is because it&#x27;s important to have more than one browser implementation. There&#x27;s no way to support that without Mozilla allocating some portion of your donation to some unrelated part of their mission.')
