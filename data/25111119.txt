Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25111210], score=None, time=1605531914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110998, text='Besides the general hand waving that doesn&#x27;t mean much (&quot;make them more iDevice like&quot;, &quot;you don&#x27;t own your computer, they do&quot;) which doesn&#x27;t say anything, the parent is talking about this particular decision.<p>As for &quot;you don&#x27;t own your computer, they do&quot;, what it translates to is: &quot;The OS places certain restrictions that work and make it safer for the large majority of users, but might not give full tinkering abilities to everybody&quot;. Which you never have (full tinkering ability) in a closed source OS, anyway.<p>While &quot;we bypass firewalls for our domains&quot; can be thought of in the same vein (&quot;we think it&#x27;s better and safer for most users to work this way, and leads to less head-scratching why X Apple service doesn&#x27;t work etc&quot;), it&#x27;s not exactly the same.<p>Apple can go towards the &quot;no tinkering direction, it&#x27;s a device that just works&quot;, without disallowing preventing user firewalls from blocking Apple domains (provided of course the user understands that by blocking them they get no iCloud and other services).<p>&gt;<i>Apple has been moving away form the professional &#x2F; hacker market for a long time, they want to sell to normal consumers and could give a shit less about the pro or hacker market.</i><p>On the other hand, the pro market (video, music, graphics, office, programming, writing, data analysis, etc) shouldn&#x27;t have workflow issues with what Apple did, and the hacker market is small (and has never been a target market).')
