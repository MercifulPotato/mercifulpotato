I match credentials locally with what my lambda runs as. Since it’s a monolith function it behaves basically the same way, including the usage of a debugger.<p>To make life a little easier any time there’s an exception it persists that ordinal payload so I can just replay it locally.<p>But I agree that serverless is mostly overrated for most use cases.')
