This modern world is too stimulating for our minds and eventually, for me, it causes a migraine. Its especially triggered by large amounts of visual information. So programming. Reading news. Browsing reddit etc. There are plenty of theories about how migraines work, but a good number orbit around the idea that the migraine brain is hyper excitable and during the run up to a migraine it loses control over its inputs.<p>So by this reasoning, a migraine is designed to stop you from consuming more information than your mind can handle. The pain of bright light is designed to keep you away from the stimulation of bright light. And the pain of noise to keep you away from stimulating noise.')
