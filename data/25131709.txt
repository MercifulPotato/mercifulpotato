It was supposed to be a 5+ year computer, and it&#x27;s already starting to feel obsolete. I&#x27;ve never even sold anything on eBay before, but I&#x27;m experiencing a panicked urgency to sell it off while I can still get most of my money back and get an M1 (before resale prices inevitably plummet).<p>Anybody else in a similar boat&#x2F;have thoughts on the matter?')
