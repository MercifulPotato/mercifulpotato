Republicans in congress and red state legislatures had pushed back against &quot;medicinal&quot; legalization over and over for years. But frame it as something to support rural farmers, and all of the sudden they&#x27;re on board. I don&#x27;t think they understood at all the actual reality of what it meant to legalize &quot;industrial hemp&quot;. The floodgates are open and there&#x27;s basically no stopping it now.')
