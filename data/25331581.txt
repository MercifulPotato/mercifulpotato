Item(by='kbumsik', descendants=None, kids=[25331772], score=None, time=1607344932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331000, text='&gt; (1) the whitepaper is too thin on tech details<p>I read a little bit and it seems critical. EFFORCE is dedicated to energy saving, but it mentions &quot;mining&quot; without any algorithm details. Assuming it is Proof-of-Work like Bitcoin (since it does &quot;mining&quot;), then why would they use the absolutely energy inefficient algorithm to save energy?<p>How an energy saving platform not mention any efforts to save energy in their tech itself?')
