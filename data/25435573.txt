And things like glibc end up implementing specialized versions of it for most architectures _and_ instruction set extensions. (So e.g., there&#x27;s one for SSE2 and for AVX on x86_64.)<p>And then of course there&#x27;s PCMPESTRI (and its variants), but that has largely been a failure because of its high latency. :-( That&#x27;s a shame, because that instruction does accept substrings up to 16 bytes.')
