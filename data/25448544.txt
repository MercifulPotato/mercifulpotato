At 55, she has an uphill battle to get another job. Why hire her when someone with 15 YOE costs less and will work for more than 5 years? Employees are not that unique.<p>Ageism is also a large problem in tech, but we just don&#x27;t talk about it much. How common is it to be on track to retire for 25+ years after aging out? What if someone forgot to change their 401(K) investment strategy and happen to be &#x27;retired&#x27; (laid off due to age) during a market downturn? Does everyone know that&#x27;s a thing you should do about 5 years before retirement?<p>There are too many &#x27;gotchas&#x27; that can seriously alter retirement plans. I think it is cruel to treat people this way, and I can see it happening to myself. Even if I do everything &#x27;right&#x27; (and I certainly have not). That is what I respond to - the warning that even if you play your hand well, you can still lose and have miserable twilight years.')
