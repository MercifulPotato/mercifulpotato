Some live in a rural area of the South and think that worsening weather is punishment for allowing gays to marry. Meanwhile when one of my cousins came out as gay, my grandparents who live a few states further North said that he didn&#x27;t choose to be gay, God made him like that, and invited him and his boyfriend to thanksgiving dinner to make sure he knew that everyone still loved him. Both groups of people are super religious (same religion even), and both use their religion to back up their beliefs, not the other way around.')
