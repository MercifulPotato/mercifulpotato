Item(by='kodah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610684233, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25786112, text='&gt; It’s easy when politics doesn’t actually impact you<p>I do not consume the news or social media and don&#x27;t find this to be true. Politics do impact me.<p>I was arrested when I was 21, prior to joining the military, for an offense that was quite trivial. I was man-handled, hauled off to jail, and forced to wait until a friend read that I was arrested in the town paper (yes, that was pretty humiliating too) and bailed me out.<p>I&#x27;m a veteran, one that&#x27;s been to Afghanistan with mild to average combat experience. When I got out in 2012 I watched my friends struggle, I struggled, and there were few options to get support and help. The help that was available often came with a catch 22. There was a time I spoke about these experiences more candidly under my real name and I was attacked by other veterans and even non-veterans for doing so. The statistics are grim from my point of view and that&#x27;s <i>not</i> just speaking about suicide statistics. Things have, in some ways, gotten better. I&#x27;ve used my success to help fund some of my friends starting foundations that focus on jobs and mental health but progress is slow.<p>A number of my childhood friends were killed during the opioid epidemic, some while I was mid-service and was unable to go home to bury them.<p>The list goes on. When I read things like:<p>&gt; You just have the great privilege of letting other people take care of that dirty work.<p>It always comes across as a dismissal, that I must be just living in denial or that I&#x27;ve somehow reached some stage in life where these things don&#x27;t affect me anymore. Feel free to read through my post history, they do. When I talk to my friends that are still patching their lives together post-service I am reminded that my own journey continues on-wards and often with them. They are the only people I can readily depend on to know experiences I know the way I know them.<p>The problem with politics is that change is slow. Getting a whole country the size of the United States to realize why and how your group is important and worth paying attention to takes time, energy, and resources which do not appear over night. People will doubt you, even question you, and it takes a piece of you with it every time they do. These are exacerbated if you appear mad, vindictive, or frustrated in the process and it&#x27;s hard not to.<p>News on the other hand moves at the speed of lightning. Attitudes and windows of understanding rapidly close and open and it can be difficult to watch in real time. I&#x27;ve told people before that history is macro-understanding, news is micro-understanding, and social media is nano-understanding. History I can do, the rest; well, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming and it has everything to do with my attachment to these subjects and the discourse in between that inevitably belittles me as a human with real experiences.')
