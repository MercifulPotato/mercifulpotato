It&#x27;s more about people being empowered to be able to fix them should they have the skill to do so.<p>I&#x27;m only following the subject casually so I might be biased to have incomplete information but apple is seemingly worse that it&#x27;s peers when it comes to repairability.<p>A quick Google search takes me to a page where Samsung lists official resellers of parts for their devices. The selection wasn&#x27;t great but as far as I know apple doesn&#x27;t do even that. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>Apple has been in litigation in my country trying to block a independent repairer from procuring parts(think it was refurbished original screens).<p>I haven&#x27;t heard of any Android phone manufacturers serial linking parts the same way apple has. At least not to the same extent.<p>TBH, I think most of the smartphone manufacturers are worse than Idd want them to be, but I definitely think Apple is among if not the worst of them when it comes to repairability')
