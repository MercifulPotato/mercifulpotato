Wasm purports to be a portable, secure, performant application runtime.  Graal purports to be a portable, secure , performant application runtime.  The latter, however, has had many more engineer-hours thrown at its implementation, and is thus both more heavyweight (so it needs all the resources it can get) and more performant (so it makes sense to use it as the backing runtime).')
