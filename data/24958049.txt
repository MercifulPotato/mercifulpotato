I would think Australia and New Zealand count, and they&#x27;ve done a pretty good job. Canada has done a relatively poor job by international standards, but still much better than the US and the UK, who have both been roundly criticized in the Anglosphere.<p>Although parts of continental Europe are struggling, there are others that have done okay - Norway and Finland, for example.<p>Outside of &quot;the west&quot;, democratic countries in East Asia like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have done alright too. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have their political issues, but they&#x27;re less authoritarian than Vietnam and China - the whole lot of them are doing well. Most of Africa is too. South America, not so much.<p>So, it&#x27;s not just about politics, and it&#x27;s not just about geographic location, and it&#x27;s not just about climate.<p>It will be interesting to see the analysis after all this is over. There must be something we can learn from why it was that certain countries failed at managing this virus while others succeeded.')
