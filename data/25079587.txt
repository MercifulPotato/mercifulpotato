Take the note editor inside Evernote for example. It just slightly more sophisticated than a common notepad.exe, but it lags and freezes like it computes the Moon flyby trajectory by numeric simulation once every few seconds.\nOr the new fancy autocompletion module for Spyder python IDE. some stupid autocompletion requires TensorFlow running and therefore I just can&#x27;t use it, because my 6 core PhenomII ( which is enough for most of what I&#x27;m working with) doesn&#x27;t have AVX-instruction set. MSVC had a decent autocompletion for ages, VisualAssist raised the bar even higher... But now I&#x27;m kinda forced to upgrade my PC to get a simply decent code autocompletion... What next? Quad-GPU rig to run notepad?')
