I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever been depressed. But, there was definitely periods in my life where I felt miserable for a long time (6 months to years). During these times-- I was listless, lack motivation, and had typical symptoms for depression. However, it never crossed a threshold where I would call it depression. Mostly because I still felt like I was in control. When I didn&#x27;t get out of bed for the day, it wasn&#x27;t because I literally can&#x27;t. I was just being lazy as shit. Of course, that fueled my sadness for a while because I would think I can fix this, but I&#x27;m not. Thus, spirally deeper.<p>Eventually, I had enough. I decided not be sad anymore. I&#x27;ll never be Bill Gates, Bruce Lee, or any of my heroes. And, people in the third world can never all the opportunities I have. So, I decided it doesn&#x27;t matter my situation. There is always some miniscule, tiny thing I can do to improve my situation. I started waking up earlier, journaling more, and stuck to these habits religiously. They became my anchor. Now I&#x27;m in a much better place. To everyone who is struggling. I hope you find your better place too.')
