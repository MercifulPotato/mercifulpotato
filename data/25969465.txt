It is always available, you know which version of the documentation you&#x27;re using, and I never understood why an intermediary should be involved when something is referenced frequently.  (Yes, I realize the latter is a personal quirk.)<p>As for StackOverflow results, at least there is a chance that they will be more useful than most third-party information.  I have found too many sites that attempt to rehash the documentation, perhaps in clearer terms but virtually always covering common knowledge and completely omitting everything else.')
