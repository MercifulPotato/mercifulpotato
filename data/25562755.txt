It happened to me at a time when I was desperate for a job change. A recruiter for RedHat strung me along for weeks before going silent. It really screwed up my job-search schedule, as RedHat was (at the time) my first choice.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure where the best place is to apply pressure:<p>(a) privately shame recruiters to the employers they represent, or<p>(b) publicly shame recruiters so that employers <i>and</i> candidates can avoid that recruiter, or<p>(c) publicly shame the employers who hire such recruiters.<p>Also, the anonymous nature seems like a double-edged sword. One could imagine hoax &#x2F; malicious reports being submitted by competitors and&#x2F;or rejected candidates. I imagine that once that loophole starts getting exploited, employers will rightfully ignore <i>all</i> the reports.')
