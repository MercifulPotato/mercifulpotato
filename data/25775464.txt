People get disenfranchised by their existing leaders. Then they are desperate for new political blood because they don&#x27;t understand the underlying problems. Clueless people who promise exactly what you want to hear start leading parties and fight the wrong battle.<p>Income inequality is driven by wealth inequality. The wealthiest people don&#x27;t get compensated in dollars, they get compensated in equity and if that equity is going up, companies can afford to pay more to their executives.<p>Wealth inequality is driven by domestic economic demand shifting away. It is either concentrating in a few economic hot spots (urbanization), moving to other countries (globalization) and through central bank money that sits around in asset markets. There are probably lots of other factors but they are increasingly less impactful.<p>Urbanization is not necessarily a bad thing if there is enough housing and people can move to the new location, except not enough housing is built and existing residents hate the new arrivals.<p>Globalization is not necessarily a bad thing if it also drives foreign demand. Turns out, the Chinese really love buying foreign real estate but nobody is building the luxury apartments they want. So they have to buy less luxurious housing and drive up prices in the middle and affordable segment of the housing market.<p>Central bank money is not necessarily a bad thing if the money is used effectively. The government can help the economy by providing cheaper funding to companies during bad years when there is lots of work to be done. But what if the economy isn&#x27;t in a bad year and merely refusing to grow? It means that there is already enough funding but not enough demand for services and workers. In that case you also have to apply the government stimulus on the demand side as well. But that&#x27;s not what central banks do. They can&#x27;t do it by definition because that&#x27;s not their responsibility. The central banks are separated from the rest of government because the government can just abuse it&#x27;s money printing powers to fund endless debt and cause hyperinflation. However, when it&#x27;s the central bank that is doing the endless printing people don&#x27;t seem to care, somehow most economists care even less and will assert that even moderate demand side stimulus will eventually lead to the slippery slope of hyperinflation.<p>Ultimately history will just repeat. A war is a quick and easy way to get rid of excess workers. It is also a quick and easy way to provide demand side stimulus in a political environment where more sensible options are considered impossible. It&#x27;s like political capital is like money. Once you have run out you are going to be extremely desperate and are willing to do anything no matter how stupid. Running out of political capital is the reason why Keynesian gold digging is even a thing in the first place. All good options have been exhausted, anything that follows is batshit insane but it is also the only thing that can be done.')
