I worked for a large company that actually got support from Broadcom for a newer part family (StrataGX).  The support was <i>dismal</i>.  You&#x27;d ask an FAE questions, they&#x27;d shrug, if you pressed hard enough (and got your executive team in the loop) you&#x27;d get an &quot;answer&quot; from the factory which was usually a pile of badly commented Verilog excerpts under NDA.  Thanks but no thanks.<p>Oh and that one time we did get sample code it was a dump of someone&#x27;s development directory, including project files for another company (you&#x27;re probably have one of their machines in your office right now).  That was fun.')
