It basically just runs ghci on your program every time you save, and gives an updated list of errors and warnings. Not interactive in the sense that you don&#x27;t manually test your functions with it, but like 95% of debugging in Haskell is just fixing errors at compilation time. I find it to be a very nice developer experience. Just need a text editor and a terminal with ghcid open and you get immediate feedback as you program.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndmitchell&#x2F;ghcid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndmitchell&#x2F;ghcid</a>')
