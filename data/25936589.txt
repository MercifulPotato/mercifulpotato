It was great for guests and also for plausible denaiblity if I every got a nastygram from my ISP.<p>But the liability just got to great and the plausible deniability argument got pretty weak.  And also, with so many neighbors with devices that will just auto join open networks, I started seeing strange traffic a lot, most likely from neighbors connecting accidentally.<p>At the end of the day, making it super easy for guests inside my house without being totally open works out well.')
