That&#x27;s false. Because of the liability for users&#x27; posts, big websites would be forced to moderate <i>more</i>. And small websites would shut down out of fear of lawsuits.<p>• Some people think that 230 must be repealed because websites are moderating too much. Well, the great thing about 230 is you can create your own websites. If you want to make your own free-speech forum and watch it be filled with far-right insurrectionists like all the other ones, you can, and you won&#x27;t assume much liability for it. On the other hand, if 230 was repealed, you would not have this option, and the big tech companies you don&#x27;t like would censor your friends for the same reasons they do today.<p>I don&#x27;t think everyone using Twitter and Facebook is good but this can&#x27;t be solved by making it hard to run small forums.<p>I also think it&#x27;s dangerous to try to force people to run their forums with “fair” moderation. Free speech is important as a right to stop the state using violence against you. Being kicked out of a private group because you&#x27;re disruptive, mean or faked your speedrunning scores, is on the other hand no great injustice that the law should interfere with.')
