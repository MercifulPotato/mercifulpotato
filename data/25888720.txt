Do all your meetings run late? Or does only the standup get this treatment?<p>Sidenote: if somebody&#x27;s late &gt; 2 mins, they can join midway or miss the standup altogether, just as is the case with any other meeting.<p>At the standup, strictly speaking, we give each developer a minute, else the master calls time on them. In a team of 7, that makes the standup 7 minutes long. Typically, people tend to keep their updates short as a way to share what they did yesterday and what they will do today. For any conversations longer than a minute, we take it offline. I have been in companies where this is done via an official master, and other places where we just follow the process ourselves as adults and don&#x27;t go overboard with updates.<p>You get back to your desk in &lt; 10 mins, practically for us - it was more like 7-8ish minutes.<p>I am no standup aficionado, and can&#x27;t claim to know where you&#x27;ve worked to know the reality virtually everywhere with such confidence, but anybody aware of the process will help you fix it. It appears you&#x27;ve not met such people.')
