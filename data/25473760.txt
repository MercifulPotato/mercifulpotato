But if it doesn&#x27;t really matter if two different pieces of code are using the same exact way to do something, then that&#x27;s likely &#x27;coincidental&#x27; replication. If you need to do word splitting, and someone else has written a word splitter, by all means copy paste their code to get you started, but definitely don&#x27;t assume the best plan is to pull their code in as a dependency.')
