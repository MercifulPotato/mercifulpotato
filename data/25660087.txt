If I am a job seeker I feel much more comfortable knowing that they expect me to write code and answer DS+Alg questions and prepare for it as opposed to companies selecting based on the the prestige level of the University you went or based on subjective judgments based on the resume and&#x2F;or company fit. As someone who went to a University in Canada that no one working at big tech companies in SV would have even heard of I appreciated that I was given a chance to show my skill as opposed to them just hiring out of Ivys&#x2F;Stanford&#x2F;MIT or other big name schools (like what happens in Law).<p>I also hate the new trend of &quot;take home&quot; tests. That just seems disrespectful of the candidate&#x27;s time.')
