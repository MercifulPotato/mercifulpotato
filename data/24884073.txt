And then of course it requires ongoing support, maintenance, docs, training, security updates etc.. That&#x27;s real work.<p>In then 1990&#x27;s when we &#x27;controlled&#x27; the software that went onto our Mac&#x2F;PCs ... that we didn&#x27;t have access to Windows or Adobe Photoshop source code wasn&#x27;t really an excessive problem.<p>Especially the fact that there was a clean delineation between &#x27;OS and Software&#x27; (other than for say MS Office Products) - then it &#x27;mostly worked&#x27;.<p>IP protections are absolutely not going away, for good reason, the challenge is to make those work as the situation evolves, moreover, they are not the &#x27;real problem&#x27; frankly, as excessive platform control (i.e. Apple, now Google) represent a more fundamental issue, and consider that happens while technically most of Android is open source anyhow.<p>Even Linux is open and popular, and to this day it&#x27;s still a mostly &#x27;dev&#x2F;interest&#x27; OS that most people don&#x27;t use in their homes, partly due to distribution power controls by MS&#x2F;Apple, but also because frankly managing massive real world deployments of &#x27;Moms, Dads and frankly most people&#x27; who &#x27;just want it to work&#x27; is an <i>operational</i> challenge as much as it is an R&amp;D&#x2F;Creative effort.<p>Consider the basic economics involved: Even reasonably smart corporations with &#x27;good IT&#x27; still don&#x27;t generally deploy Linux to regular userbase. Why not? Because $50 a year to MS is very cheap, and frankly worth every penny in terms of value created. Any &#x27;supported&#x27; Linux variation is going to cost &#x27;something&#x27; anyhow, so what&#x27;s the difference between &#x27;$20 a year&#x27; for some &#x27;supported Linux variation&#x27; and &#x27;$50 a year&#x27; for MW Windows? Basically nothing. In a per capita basis, the true cost of a lot of software is marginal.')
