All such things are clutter to me, and in fact, I even reject re-painting the walls.<p>I fear that I will notice the room is smaller, after that coating of paint.<p>I&#x27;m worried that now <i>I&#x27;m</i> signalling, that I&#x27;m not signalling, which is signalling now.  Maybe.<p>So I support you, fellow non-signalling, and non-non-signalling kin!  Yes, you can have paintings, just because you like them.<p>(Please don&#x27;t tell me that I&#x27;m signalling by non-non-signalling!)')
