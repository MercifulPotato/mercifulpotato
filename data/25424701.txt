At least with opioids, the risk of overdose is far more widely understood, and a remedy to overdoses (naloxone) exists, in case it happens. There is the downside of its addictiveness, but in particularly severe cases of patients suffering from really bad pain, it sounds like controlled, limited doses of opioid-based pain killers might be safer? I&#x27;m not a doctor, I&#x27;m just wondering.')
