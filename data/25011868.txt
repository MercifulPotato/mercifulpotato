One thing that happens with anxiety is that, in many cultures, you start to feel a bit of shame about it. Like, &quot;This is easy, everyone else is  doing fine, what&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> with me?!?&quot; kind of shame. You internalize it and it builds and feeds into the same cycle and promotes the anxiety.<p>Learning that you&#x27;re not alone helps to break that cycle (even just for a moment) and brings things into better perspective. One of the key things I had to develop years ago was the skill to restore perspective to my thoughts (that task-breakdown thing is just one thing). When I find myself becoming angry, I have to ask myself, &quot;Is this an appropriate response?&quot; Some drunk just took off the front half of your car? Anger may not be helpful, but it&#x27;s appropriate. There&#x27;s no more milk in the fridge? The anger is not warranted, take a breath, realize that you&#x27;re stressed, and put &quot;milk&quot; on the grocery list.<p>And substitute all negative emotions into the above. At my worst, I&#x27;d get emotionally sad over incredibly tiny things like spilling a bit of salt (not even the whole shaker). Examine that emotion when it rises, don&#x27;t try to stop it but examine it. Ask if it&#x27;s appropriate, ask if there&#x27;s another cause or other factors involved.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily easy, it depends on how stressed you are at the moment. But if you try to make that a habit of thought, over time it becomes easier and almost automatic.<p>Additionally, please consider seeking out a therapist. Having someone to speak to confidentially and who can help develop these kinds of skills is incredibly helpful.')
