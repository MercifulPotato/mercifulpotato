We are still in very early stages, but we do have some mechanisms planned to mitigate the effect of bad actors on the network:<p>- we plan to build in something similar to HTTPS Everywhere to the product, to automatically upgrade connections (and we only route traffic on ports 80 &#x2F; 443 (optionally 53)). \n- we also plan to build in the ability to allow peers to block certain categories of traffic from going over their connection (using blocklists similar to those used by Fortiguard -- so you could block all torrenting sites, as an example).<p>Early days still, but much to come!')
