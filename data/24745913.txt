I used this to great effect when rewriting all of the CRT math functions for a game console some years ago. On the other hand, if you have a function that takes multiple floats or a double as input then the search space is too big. In that case a mixture of test cases for suspected problem areas and random testing should work.&quot;<p>I think the point is that exhaustive testing is feasible in more situations than you might at first think, and than floating-point arithmetic is a particularly fertile source of edge conditions and corner cases, so it&#x27;s a good place to go for exhaustive testing where you can.')
