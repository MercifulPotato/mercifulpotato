The organisers would decree the specs of the championship hardware some time in advance. Now, (at least for TCEC, the other major engine tournament) they pick two hardware configurations, one CPU-heavy and one GPU-heavy, and give each team the choice.<p>How do you balance those? It&#x27;s been suggested you should make them equal in terms of watts of power, or dollar cost to buy, but neither of those are obviously best. In practice the TCEC organisers pick something close to what they picked last time but shade it against the winning engines, making the contest more even. Chess.com likely do something similar though they&#x27;re less rigorous about the details.')
