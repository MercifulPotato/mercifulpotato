I don&#x27;t feel that optimizing for Greenwald&#x27;s personal value system <i>at this particular time</i> would be the right tradeoff for America as a whole. Greenwald having the satisfaction of doing the right thing while the rest of us endure the rule of a strong man hell-bent on becoming America&#x27;s Putin is not a fair trade.<p>It sucks that we don&#x27;t live in a society where &quot;The Truth&quot; - if it could only be exposed to sunlight - would stand taller and brighter than everything else around it. If Greenwald wants to cosplay Walter Cronkite, and who wouldn&#x27;t, he has to understand the impossibility of that in our current context. Everything is turned into spin for the disinformation machine. Everything is distorted, filtered, weaponized, super concentrated, and targeted directly to those it will anger the most. Truth has no power and no legitimacy in this context. Have we not learned anything from watching Trump these past four years?<p>We have to solve <i>that</i> problem before we can enjoy the benefits of truthful journalism. A  problem for which <i>we</i> have to take some responsibility, since <i>our</i> technology is being abused to create this wretched hellscape.<p>It sucks and it isn&#x27;t the world in which I want to live. I have young children myself. They will grow up with no Walter Cronkite, no trusted source of information. They will grow up in a world where truth is disconnected from reality. It&#x27;s broken, and we can&#x27;t ignore that, no matter how much it hurts us personally.')
