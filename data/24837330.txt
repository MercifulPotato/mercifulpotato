There are a few filler words added to make the meter work out (&quot;There&#x27;s strontium and silicon and silver and samarium&quot;), and a couplet in English at the end, but otherwise it&#x27;s just the elements.<p>The rhyme is trivial, since every line ends with &quot;ium&quot;. To do it with anything else you&#x27;d need to work a lot harder.')
