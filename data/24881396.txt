Performance doesn&#x27;t just happen. Within limited constraints, focusing on performance will necessarily imply less feature.<p>I don’t think this has to be the case. I’ve found that it’s not really that much harder to develop in a language like C++ compared to JS. You can develop the same feature set using better tools and end up with a more performant product (plus you get a typechecker). Performance is a feature, and if you use good tools and a language that enables efficiency without much effort, it doesn’t have to be a fixed cost added on to development.<p>Writing similar imperative code in C++ as you would in JS with no effort spent on optimizing is almost guaranteed to be much, much more efficient. I guess my point is that to some extent performance vs. more features is a false dichotomy.')
