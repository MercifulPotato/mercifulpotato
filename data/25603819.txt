I don&#x27;t really agree with most of this statement at all.<p>The web is a powerful platform for a lot of reasons but I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s easy to develop for, iOS is a much less hostile and predicatble environment to run client side code in. I also don&#x27;t believe that CSS&#x2F;HTML are particularly well suited to rich mobile applications in comparison to UIKit or SwiftUI. I still write PWAs and native apps and don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t coexist. Proponents of the PWA approach seem to really want PWAs to replace native development.<p>There is a lot of functionality and APIs that native apps have access to on both platforms, I&#x27;m not sure I see the point in browser developers implementing every single one of them when a subset can cover 70% of JSON-viewer type app needs, the remaining niche can be written as native apps.')
