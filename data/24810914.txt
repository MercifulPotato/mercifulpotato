Building a mockup to test is part of what I was describing.<p>The point is that you can&#x27;t simply make a mockup, assume it proves your hypothesis, and then go heads-down building the exact product shown in the mockups for 6-24 months and expect great results. Instead, you need to iterate both the mockups and the product in parallel, engaging with the market along the way.<p>As in the example I provided, sometimes customers will claim to love your mockups but then decline to pay for the product when it arrives. It&#x27;s one of the first things every product manager learns in the real world.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a good way to separate the technology decisions from the business decisions.<p>Trying to separate technology from the business decisions is a mistake. At the start of the process, you need technology, product, sales, and business to be tightly intertwined.<p>Dividing the labor and sending different roles in different directions is a mistake at an early stage company. You need to get everyone working together to iterate over and over again.')
