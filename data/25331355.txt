But &#x27;all&#x27; the free version does is edit video clips. You have to pay for additional functionality. Premiere Elements, in contrast, has lots of useful things like creating&#x2F;handling non-video assets such as text for titles and credits, loads of (sometimes cheesy) clip transitions, etc etc.<p>The free version lets you create titles, animations, transitions and you get access to their after effects comparable tool for fancy animations as well as color grading and audio &#x2F; video editing.<p>It&#x27;s a very reasonable free offering. I use it all the time to edit podcasts. I want to use it for editing video too but I have issues with it adding artifacts to the rendered videos, I think it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t like my 6 year old GTX 750ti.')
