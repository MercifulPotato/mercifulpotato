But this time really is different. No other JVM language has backing or buy-in even remotely comparable to Kotlin, and it&#x27;s more seamless than any other JVM language I&#x27;ve experienced.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, in case I come off as a die-hard Kotlin fan, I&#x27;m really not. I strongly disagree with many choices the designers make with Kotlin - there&#x27;s too many to list, but the common theme is basically, as good as Kotlin is at discouraging the worst of Java, it still caters <i>far</i> too much to nonsensical Java practices IMO.')
