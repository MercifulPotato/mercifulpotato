Friction brakes translate 100% of the kinetic energy into waste heat, through abrasion.<p>While it&#x27;s true that regenerative brakes are not frictionless, none that I&#x27;m aware of <i>rely</i> on friction.  One could imagine using a clutch to controllably wind&#x2F;unwind a spring, for example, but auto manufacturers aren&#x27;t rinky-dink steampunkers and even so you&#x27;d still do everything you could to minimize clutch slippage.')
