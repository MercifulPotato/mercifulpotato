The Spectre is better than the MacBook.  Both have aluminum bodies, 4K screens, big touch pads, they are the same size, both have great performance.<p>The HP has a much better keyboard.  So much better.  It runs Linux, not quite perfectly but pretty darn well.  I actually like that the HP has a touchscreen, it’s often way quicker to reach out and touch a spot on the screen than to maneuver the mouse pointer to that same spot and then click.  The HP has a regular USB port so I don’t <i>have</i> to keep a USB-C adapter around.  The charger isn’t a giant heavy wall wart that falls out of older outlets.  It’s a bunch of little things like that.')
