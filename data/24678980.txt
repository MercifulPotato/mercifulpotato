Everyone in the discussion is well aware that the 2nd. law of thermodynamics prevents the continuous extraction of work from ambient heat without there being a temperature difference. Are you saying that <i>the paper</i> is claiming that this has been done? If not that, are you claiming that the device, as described <i>in the paper</i>, is incapable of generating power from <i>fluctuations</i> in the ambient temperature? Have you identified some other problem <i>in the paper?</i> Alternatively - I don&#x27;t think you are saying this, but I will put it in for completeness - could it be that you are saying that <i>the paper</i> shows that this team really has invented a Maxwell&#x27;s diode, capable of continuously extracting work from the ambient heat of a closed system in thermal equilibrium?<p>If you are still only taking issue with the press release, you are just nerdsplaining to a bunch of people who already get it, thank you very much.')
