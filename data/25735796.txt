We dealt with an entire year of content on Facebook encouraging and inciting violence but it was okay because it was aligned ideologically with the powers that be.<p>I personally lost track of how many people just in my own friend&#x27;s list advocating for &quot;punching nazis&quot;, where &quot;nazis&quot; is a generic term for &quot;anyone I strongly disagree with politically&quot;. Heck, I saw multiple people post videos of violence against people they consider &quot;nazis&quot; and celebrating it.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m 100% against the violence both last year and on Jan 6th, but it&#x27;s amazing how egregious the double standard is between last year and Jan 6th.')
