Why is interaction with a detector different than interaction with another particle?<p>&gt; Many Worlds simply reframes this problem, but doesn&#x27;t get rid of it.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding. It&#x27;s like asking &quot;why is there a difference between me jumping in a swimming pool and someone else jumping in it? I don&#x27;t get wet when someone else is swimming.&quot; The difference is... one of you is in the pool. It&#x27;s not going to spontaneously make the other person wet.<p>In MWI the difference is that if it interacts with a particle, you&#x27;re not entangled, the particle is. If it interacts with a detector then you&#x27;re entangled. So, there is no difference except for what gets entangled.<p>What that means is the wave function can only appear to collapse when you entangle. If some particle entangles, it will collapse for that particle and branch into a new world, but you&#x27;re not in that world; for you it&#x27;s still a waveform.<p>Edited for clarity.')
