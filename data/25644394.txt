Item(by='RobertoG', descendants=None, kids=[25645579], score=None, time=1609845937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644300, text='&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#x27;s very unlikely that you&#x27;d get a one step transfer from a bat that yielded a spike protein with the level of affinity it has for human ACE2. If you look at that protein alone, the most-likely proximal hosts are primates&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not qualified to have an opinion about that, but it seems to me that if we accept that premise, and the primate jump looks improbable, the conclusion is that the virus have to come from a lab where it has been modified.<p>On the other hand, many experts are saying &quot;we don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s probably natural&quot;. So, it seems to me that the scientific consensus is giving different prior probabilities to zoonotic transfer that you gave in that statement.')
