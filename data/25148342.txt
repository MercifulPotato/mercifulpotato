Both produced by the same company, yet quite unreliable together. It&#x27;s probably related to the shitty BT implementation, or WiFi noise. But to sell expensive headphones that fail at producing, you know, ... sound, it&#x27;s quite a feat. And on this MBP model there&#x27;s no wired microphone input, because aesthetics, or just to save a penny.')
