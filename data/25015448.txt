States create policies (Ideally, these policies would be entirely democratically chosen, alas that&#x27;s rarely how it works). Markets appear. No market can make any meaningful decision on what to do and where to go at any time out of day to day operation.<p>Unfortunately the EU commission (and most of our governments) seem to believe that &quot;let the magic invisible hand of the market work, and all will be great&quot;. Not.<p>On another note, it&#x27;s fascinating to see that about 80-85% of our energy in Europe is from fossil fuels. A very large (and rapidly increasing) part of these fossil fuels are imported (because North sea is in rapid decline), often from quite unpleasant countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc). But apparently noone in power seem genuinely interested in sorting out this big problem in a way that would be advantageous to the European public (not even mentioning the climate). Some actively behave like foreign agents, in fact. Go figure.')
