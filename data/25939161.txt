We want to think that the new ideas we receive at the beginning of our career are the final piece of the puzzle, that there&#x27;s no point in generations beyond us.  Our ideas give us special powers to accomplish things that no previous generation could accomplish, and no subsequent generation will accomplish much more, or the same things much easier, than we did.  We are standing at the end of history.  We are the generation that left the desert and entered the promised land.<p>History upsets all that.  History teaches us that the future will stand in relation to us as we stand in relation to the past, whereas we want to believe that we are equals with the future and superior to the past.')
