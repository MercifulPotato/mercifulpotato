I used to have better-than 20&#x2F;20 vision, I would guess that I now have around 20&#x2F;20 vision. I find the text to be too small on the home page and scrunched up. I&#x27;m on a 4k monitor, and the front page stops at &quot;30&quot; and wants me to click &quot;More&quot; instead of loading in more posts automatically (and loading in even more as I scroll). I find this inconvenient and wasteful - I&#x27;d much rather each post take up more height, and I&#x27;d strongly prefer a &quot;infinite&quot; scrolling system. Even if I was on a 1080p monitor, I&#x27;d rather have each post on the front page take up <i>double</i> the amount of vertical space it does now than have it&#x27;s current UI. The loss of information density would be (to me) well worth it.<p>I&#x27;ve switched from a mac and iPhone to Linux and Android, and as you can tell, I&#x27;m still on HN. Clearly, design isn&#x27;t absolutely everything to me. But the notion that aesthetics &quot;get in the way for the most part&quot; is one I and most other developers I know in real life disagree with. I&#x27;d argue that HN&#x27;s aesthetics get in the way. I personally have used browser extensions to change the HN CSS, due to how much I dislike the UI.')
