Your viewpoints are grounded in thousands of other people in the same echo chamber as you repeating the same claims as a cultural weapon to gain political power, but there&#x27;s never anything backing it up. I don&#x27;t care how many people you&#x27;ve convinced to hold these beliefs, it doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>You say that I want to reject contradictory evidence, but you never provide the contradictory evidence. Having a bunch of people convinced that the police are evil isn&#x27;t contradictory evidence. Having people repeat your viewpoint isn&#x27;t proof that the viewpoint is correct.<p>For an extraordinary claim you need extraordinary evidence. For something like your anti-police sentiment (which is funny because now all of the sudden nearly all police are evil, in all states, all counties, no matter the gender or race breakdown of the police, no matter what city&#x2F;county&#x2F;state&#x2F;department laws and procedures are, all of the sudden police are all just evil? That&#x27;s curious isn&#x27;t it?) it isn&#x27;t backed up by evidence. You can link to videos alleging &quot;police brutality&quot; but none of them that I&#x27;ve ever been linked to show such a thing. Of course mistakes are made, when there&#x27;s millions of interactions between citizens and police every day, a one in a million or even one in a billion mistake still happens, humans aren&#x27;t perfect. But for the claims you&#x27;re making there should be extraordinary evidence, and there isn&#x27;t any.<p>Now, somebody else in the world will read your comment and in some part incorporate it into their viewpoint, and repeat it elsewhere, just propagating the idea further.')
