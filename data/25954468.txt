The habitats are not very large and the entire complex isn&#x27;t very large either. There&#x27;s just not that much to see compared to similarly priced famous exhibitions (say San Diego Zoo, NY Botanical Garden, etc.). I understand it&#x27;s a little different from a traditional zoo, but I wouldn&#x27;t make a stop if I were just a tourist. There are better things to see in Montreal if you have a limited amount of time.* It&#x27;s just not that biologically diverse and very expensive per square meter of viewing space.<p>*For perspective, I go to Montreal multiple times a year for decades now, and I only went to the biodome once as an adult. If I lived there, I would probably take my kids.')
