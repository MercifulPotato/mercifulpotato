The church members individually have the right to practice their religion however they want so long as it doesn&#x27;t impinge on others&#x27; rights or laws.  The group aspect really doesn&#x27;t come into play at all.  In the same way, those same individuals can contribute <i>as individuals</i> to whatever cause they choose.  The problem is when resources get pooled and an <i>organization</i> rather than its individuals decides where to allocate those resources politically.
