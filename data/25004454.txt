One of the leading indicators of fraud during vote tallies in Russia (where 100% of the elections are falsified) is _rounding_ to the nearest 5%, and in some locations (such as Chechnya and Dagestan) to 99% at the polling place level for the &quot;preferred&quot; candidate or outcome. If you plot the histogram of percentages, this results in spikes at 5% intervals for the &quot;preferred&quot; candidate and troughs for the rest, in the same locations. Eliminating such peaks would require a lot of coordination, and nobody bothers with that since everyone knows what&#x27;s up.<p>If such data can&#x27;t be downloaded, that&#x27;d seem like a major oversight, which must be rectified through legislation. If such legislation is not taken up by Congress, that&#x27;d be pretty damning in itself.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themoscowtimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;data-scientist-claims-staggering-fraud-at-russias-constitution-vote-a70769" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themoscowtimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;data-scientist-cla...</a>')
