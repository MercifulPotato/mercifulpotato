It&#x27;s not <i>too</i> difficult to imagine how using 90% of that to target specific problems could improve life in tangible ways for a measurable chunk of the world&#x27;s population, and <i>still</i> leave each of them billionaires. (In fact, judging by rankings from Forbes last year, it would still leave them among the top 50 richest people in the world!)')
