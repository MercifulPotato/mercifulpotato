If you built a platform to make doing meta-analysis easier, you could collaborate with medical researchers and institutions who are publishing meta-analyses. Maybe give it to them for free at first, maybe get an author credit, some PR, and more sales leads. Researchers can probably use grant money to buy access to your platform and still save money on paying analysts to do things manually.')
