A music critic&#x27;s list of the 100 best songs of 2020 is not inferior to Billboard&#x27;s list of the 100 most popular songs of 2020 as determined by quantified data.<p>Twitter is a cultural phenomenon, and its milieu(s) and output aren&#x27;t completely unworthy of journalistic attention.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s a top shelf subject, but the &quot;news&quot; properly covers all kinds of similar things, and some, like sports for instance, have even less value.')
