For example, the login behaviour could depend on FastAPI-Users, with a sibling frontend library containing components that implement the same login flow.  Adding user behaviour is then a matter of using the same third-party library on the front and back end.<p>This approach could be extended to other components such as an admin panel (perhaps using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;awtkns&#x2F;fastapi-crudrouter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;awtkns&#x2F;fastapi-crudrouter</a>), or a blogging component.')
