Depends on how desperate you are for it. I&#x27;ve had a successful 10+ year career in web dev in the UK. I&#x27;ve always avoided places that had a technical interview, it&#x27;s a phobia of mine.<p>I&#x27;ve landed multiple contracts without any technical interview, a couple of them from just an informal chat. I once kept rejecting an interview for a company that specified a tech test, then 6 months after they first contacted, the recruiter said they&#x27;d dropped the tech test, I phone interviewed then went in and got the job.<p>Granted these are not the FAANG type places that Americans seem to be so obsessed over, but they look good on a UK CV and every contract I worked on was &gt;Â£100k pa. I have never had any desire for prestige-type positions, what matters to me is an interesting project where I can develop skills, good rate, and good working environment. Ultimately the high rates of these contracts allowed me to work less and ultimately enjoy freedom which is my main goal.')
