If you have someone who perfectly understands the algorithm but can’t write the code, that’s a different utility than someone who can write code but doesn’t know the optimal algorithm solution. You can say “at work I’d look up a reference” but in an interview setting that’s not helpful where the interviewer needs both. That’s kind of why I really don’t like remote tests. It’s really hard to filter out those trying to cheat. I’ve observed how leetcode stuff tries to track you looking stuff up and it’s theater. Just get a tablet or second laptop (or even use your phone) and the site can’t track if you’re actually looking that up.<p>I get annoyed with those tests and interviews too, but I’m aware of the challenge on the other side so I take it with a grain of salt and would never let my ego make me arrogant enough to take umbrage at being asked to write down a piece of code. I can understand the frustration, but this process is applied equally along all levels. Hell, the most talented people I worked with were regularly interviewed on coding by people more inexperienced&#x2F;less talented than them. I would have a hard time any of them expressing anything other than mild annoyance at the system that this is still the best we’ve managed to do and no one would think to say “what right does this young inexperienced person have to ask me questions”. If anything, that attitude would instantly disqualify someone on the “fit” axis of the interview even if they passed on the technical merits.')
