(With two exceptions [1], all my investments have been the &quot;buy shares of a mutual fund and hold it forever except for occasional exchanges with other funds I&#x27;m going to hold forever, or when I need to make a big purchase like a new car&quot; kind of investments). Thus, I&#x27;m quite confused here.<p>What is this &quot;deposit&quot; in this case?<p>Could someone walk through what happens in this case: I have $X at my cash account at a broker, and I direct that broker to buy something that will cost $Y (including any broker fees, commissions, required tax withholding, etc.), where Y &lt;= X.<p>I presume that ultimately I end up wit the thing I wanted to buy, and my cash account ends up with $(X-Y)?<p>So what happens as a step along the road to making that happen that requires the broker to use money that is not money from my cash account?<p>[1] In 1998 or 1999, the newsreader I used on Red Hat started corrupting my .newsrc after an update. I tracked it down to a change in one of the ctype macros in the C standard library. The newsreader assumed that all the flags fit in a char, which had been true before the update, but now wasn&#x27;t. I submitted a patch that changed one declaration in the newsreader from &quot;char&quot; to &quot;unsigned short&quot;. When Red Hat was going to IPO, I was surprised to get an email telling me that since I was a contributor to Red Hat, I could buy Red Hat stock at the IPO price. I bought a few thousand dollars worth that morning at $14&#x2F;share, sold them that afternoon at something like $70&#x2F;share, transferred the money out, and never touched my ETrade account again.<p>Who says submitting patches to open source doesn&#x27;t pay? :-)<p>The other time was when T-Mobile gave every customer one share of stock. Eventually they got tired of having to deal with having a bazillion people who owned one share each of their stock, and told us we had to transfer our shares to the broker of our choice or sell. I sold.')
