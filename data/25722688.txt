Item(by='LatteLazy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610326584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722018, text='I guess I&#x27;m arguing for 2 things:<p>* declaring pretty much any company (including cloud computing platforms and maybe the Apple app store and few others) a utility IF they have this sort of market breaking power.<p>* creating a lower tier than full &quot;utility&quot; status where a company does not have market breaking power but where they do have excess power.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced AWS has market breaking power because parler could get another provider. But getting and moving to another provider on ~24h notice is pretty market breaking. So maybe AWS (and other sub-utilities or whatever you want to call them) can cut you off BUT they need to give you 28 days notice and arrange for transfer of data and continuity of service. To me this is like if you&#x27;re out of lease, your landlord still has to give you notice, they can&#x27;t just turn up at 9am and tell you you need to be out by 5.<p>I don&#x27;t think those are too onerous as requirements. And I do think that many companies (Google for search and ads, Visa&#x2F;Mastercard) have gotten just as &quot;infrastructural&quot; as power&#x2F;water&#x2F;phone companies were back when the original push to utility status occurred. There should be a push to balance that.<p>That&#x27;s power that reaches across our society without any check or balance or democratic input.<p>In fairness, Google etc have been pretty good at NOT abusing that power. But why wait for an abuse.<p>Ironically that&#x27;s what parlar should teach us: be a bit more proactive about your problems, don&#x27;t wait for a seige of the senate chamber.<p>What do you think? Have I gone off the deep end? :)<p>Fyi, this isn&#x27;t just about parlar and controversial content etc. YouTube bans educational channels pretty much at random and no one does anything about it until there is a twitter storm. That&#x27;s not right. Apple thinks it has a right to ban tumblr because nipples. Also, wrong imho. If Apple want be the main app provider (via app store for non-jail-broken users), they need to play fair not favourites.')
