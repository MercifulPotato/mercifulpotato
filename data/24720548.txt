What ALWAYS happens is unexpected feature requests break clean APIs setup by engineers, which creates all this fake work of “making the breaking change” across the dozens of dependents.<p>Something like a monorepo could help prevent issues like this, but it’s not a guarantee you’re making it easier to ship one latest version of your software.')
