Ending the practice of Unelected Governers.<p>&gt; 8. Give equal representation all states in the upper house as in the US senate(2 senator s from each state).<p>I am sorry, but we certainly do not need the worst parts of the US system. It is not just bad. It is catastrophic.<p>Having 2 elected houses is monumentally stupid idea that allows politicians to trap the system in blockages, while pointing fingers at each other for no repercussions.<p>&gt; Codification of the law of Torts.<p>I hope this never happens. The super litigious part of America through civic laws leads to a lot of services getting needlessly expensive.<p>________<p>India has big problems, but almost none of them are the ones you mention.')
