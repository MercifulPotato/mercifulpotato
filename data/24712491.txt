The acquisition hopefully was a good outcome for 2ndQuadrant and EDB. But I don&#x27;t personally see it changing the landscape of providers. There are a lot of companies that offer support, consulting, and services for Postgres. 2ndQuadrant has long been one place I would refer people to in Europe, but less so in the US. While some friends do work in the US for them most of their engineering happens in EU. There is a lot of options in Europe still, from Dalibo to Cybertec to Postgres Professional. In the US you&#x27;ve had Crunchy Data, PGExperts, and EDB for some time (all of them in existence for longer than 5 years now). That has not changed, maybe we need more than this... but it isn&#x27;t something to the scale of many other monopolies.<p>The percentage of concentration on core is an issue and my outside of core understanding is that such is being addressed.<p>For non-competes, perhaps this is a bigger issue than I realize. But being based in California I&#x27;m surprised to see this. Having worked at one place running and managing Postgres (Heroku) to then go to another to run and manage Postgres (Citus Data) to joining Microsoft to run and manage Postgres, I&#x27;m now doing similar at Crunchy Data building and running our multi-cloud Postgres service - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchybridge.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchybridge.com</a>. Perhaps non-competes are a big issue for some east coast or for European countries, but at least where I sit I&#x27;m surprised by that argument.')
