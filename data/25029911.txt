On Windows, you often can&#x27;t help but run semi-trusted proprietary software, so multi-user security technology (especially when combined with some type of mandatory access control) is very useful. I think that macOS Catalina does a better job of this: untrusted software running as your user account cannot read every file in your home directory by default.')
