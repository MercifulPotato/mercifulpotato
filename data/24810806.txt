It&#x27;s typical for people to draw an imaginary line in the sand  of cultures or subcultures they care about and believe that everything that came before them was better than everything that came after.<p>They&#x27;re right in a particularly narrow-minded way that only considers the &quot;modern web&quot; to be the public feed on Reddit and the worst parts of Twitter, and corporate sites and the effect of SEO. But it&#x27;s also the case that the quality of content on the modern web far surpasses that of the early web <i>because</i> so many more people, representing a greater diversity of cultures and ideas, are on it and able to express themselves.<p>So if that&#x27;s &quot;Eternal September&quot; then I think it can be argued that it was as much evolution as devolution.')
