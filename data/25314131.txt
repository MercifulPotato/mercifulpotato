To be clear, there’s no question it exists. But multiple (admittedly former) google researchers have gone on record saying that this is meant to be a quick scan for trade secrets leakage, and nothing more than that. Certainly not some kind of academic integrity review. That’s what the journal reviewers are for.<p>The point of the scientific process is to be allowed to fail and to be mistaken. And the paper was pretty bland. Sure, she didn’t namedrop all relevant research over the last decade, but why demand a retraction? Especially when the reviewers posted on Reddit that there was a big edit window to make revisions. Adding a few more cites seems like “oh, why not throw in X?” then you both go out to lunch &#x2F; email an updated version later that day. A retraction is basically “your last few months have been wasted,” right? I’d probably be upset too.<p>Thanks again for the datapoint about the 3 day window. It seems rather selective, but that’s standard for any bigco. I’m just having a hard time stomaching the idea that your ideas need to pass through some anonymous internal review panel where you don’t even know who’s judging you. Is that really what it’s like to be there? Seems strange.')
