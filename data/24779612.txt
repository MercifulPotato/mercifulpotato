It isn&#x27;t about being stoic. Simply enduring a job is not healthy. Instead, take a hard look at your personal goals. Do the negative aspects of you job prevent you from doing your part well, getting your check and supporting your family? Does a power-tripping, political co-worker prevent you from supporting your family, or are they just annoying?<p>Maybe the change in perspective is not trying to be stoic, but thinking about it in another way. If you ask yourself, &quot;Would I put up with this for $X&#x2F;hour?&quot;, and the answer is yes, then your problem isn&#x27;t with the people, it is with your compensation. If your answer is no, then your problem is with the people, and you should find a different environment.<p>In other words, don&#x27;t fret over annoyances that are not actually stopping you from reaching your goals. The corporate world is flawed. People are flawed. Accepting that while still defining your own goals and sticking to boundaries that make sure your progress towards your goals often will often let the flaws of a job be less bothersome.')
