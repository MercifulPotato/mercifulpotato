It can be self-hosted and the plan is to have something like TiddlyWiki so that you can use it as a whole HTML file in your own website. The documentation is a read-only version of logseq itself and it&#x27;s hosted on GitHub pages.<p>The org mode parser is open sourced too, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mldoc&#x2F;mldoc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mldoc&#x2F;mldoc</a>, most features are already supported, we&#x27;re working on something like org agenda and org-roam integrations.<p>Documentation example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logseq.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logseq.github.io&#x2F;</a>.\nAny questions or feedback will be appreciated, thank you!')
