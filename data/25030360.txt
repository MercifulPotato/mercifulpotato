This is the Council of the European Union, which is the relevant cabinet members from the national governments. You vote out your representative in, say, the Environment Council, in exactly the same way you vote out the national Minister of Environment (or equivalent) in your EU country, <i>because it&#x27;s literally the same person</i>.<p>Confusingly, there&#x27;s also the European Council. You vote out your representative in there by voting out your your head of government (president, premier, taoiseach etc.), because again, <i>it&#x27;s literally the same person</i>.<p>And if you&#x27;re talking about the commission, which seems to have little to do with this, you vote them out by voting in different heads of government (again) to nominate different commissioners&#x2F;a different president, and&#x2F;or different members of the European parliament to not confirm them.')
