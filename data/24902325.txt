Secure Boot is a <i>feature</i> that is implemented <i>by</i> UEFI-compliant systems these days, but UEFI systems originally shipped completely without the feature and it&#x27;s still perfectly possible to do so.<p>Complaints about Secure Boot are generally valid complaints to have.  Complaints about UEFI that are actually just complaints about Secure Boot are... just complaints about Secure Boot.  Valid complaints about UEFI that are <i>unrelated</i> to Secure Boot are rare.')
