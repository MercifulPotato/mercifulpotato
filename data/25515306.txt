Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608708040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25514158, text='&gt;&gt;&gt;  I always like to say that we live in an exponential meritocracy, where your accumulated merit enhances your ability to accumulate more merit, eventually resulting in a small minority rapidly pulling ahead of the pack. Goes with the old adage: turning $100 into $120 is work; turning $100 million into $120 million is inevitable. Perhaps we need a linear meritocratic function.<p>&gt;&gt; So basically, some way to prevent wealth from being passed across generations?<p>&gt; Neither Gates, nor Jobs, nor Zuckerberg, nor Bezos, nor Musk inherited their billions. At best they inherited access to the social circles of their parents, and maybe paid-for education (too lazy to check). Knowing the right people is not something you can, or want, to limit or forbid.<p>But, there are others who did.  For instance, just off the top of my head: the Koch brothers, who combined inherited wealth with extensive political activism.<p>Also, the fortunes of most &quot;self-made&quot; meritocrats can be traced to building exponentially on some elite inherited opportunity, then that kneecaps a lot of the moral reasoning used to justify that those people deserve full control of those fortunes (and thus shouldn&#x27;t be subjected to heavy taxes).')
