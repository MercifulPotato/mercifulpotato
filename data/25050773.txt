It was dog slow, I’ll never go back, it’s not just the performance, but lack of stability, crashes, lots of exceptions, etc.  It just feels like a project that’s not been given the love, and one that’s just having more and more features built on top of shaky foundations.<p>The other day one of my team (who still uses VS) complained of cut n paste not working (it would paste half the selection).<p>The basics are broken in my humble opinion')
