I came to this conclusion from reading about what investment bankers themselves say. It was not about who is shallow or who is deep. You can be super shallow and still end up more attracted to new guy that is actually around, more then to partner that brings money but is never around.<p>&gt; In both cases hopefully the relationship becomes less about what attracted you in the first place and more about the friendship and shared life.<p>Yeah, but there is no friendship if you two don&#x27;t see each other at all. There is no shared life between investment banker and his wife. There can be attraction part, due to good look and money and social status as you say. But exactly this friendship and shared life is something they cant really have.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also terrible for women who enjoy their peak power in their twenties in a way all but the very highest status men will never know<p>This is just dumb, no offense meant, but still.')
