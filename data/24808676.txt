Other than that, it&#x27;s par for the course.</i><p>Abon and Verstappen are no the only legitimate gaps; Leclerc vs Vettle and Ricc vs Ocon are also substantial.<p>A better driver can take 250ms off their team mate - something that would take multiple millions of dollars a year to obtain via regular engineering.<p>That said, I agree that a great driver such as Ricciardo has no chance to compete for the WDC in his car.')
