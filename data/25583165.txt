Item(by='asveikau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609346557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582934, text='&gt; 2) &quot;#define P&quot; is clunky for several reasons: a) why do we have to care about POD vs non-POD?<p>Because the latter needs some equivalent to a copy constructor and destructor.<p>I had another reaction: there is no equivalent to a move constructor? That becomes painful when it&#x27;s time to support a vector of vectors. (Don&#x27;t want to do a deep copy of all elements when you resize the vector.)')
