The internet <i>is</i> speech now. Visiting city halls and council meetings doesn&#x27;t affect elections or policies, voting is useless without being part of an organized bloc, which can no longer happen without the internet, and Parler was one of several alt-right attempts to make their own platform--control of the internet is centralized enough that making a platform for non-technical users against the will of the megacorporations is not possible.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe free speech absolutism should be allowed, say so, but free speech and this level of corporate dominance are not compatible.')
