However, it is a small old book so not that much of an investment.<p>It did have a few ideas which were new to me and it presents a holistic consistent management philosophy which you don&#x27;t get from reading a hodge-podge of blog posts.<p>Two (for me) new ideas: Matrix organisation is inevitable for large companies in search of the sweet spot between agility and efficiency.
