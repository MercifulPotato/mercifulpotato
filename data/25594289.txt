Sad.<p>It’s incredibly depressing that in the context of a discussion of transport safety, you seem to think we’re doomed to 30,000 dead a year from crashes alone, to say nothing of shortened poorer quality lives from obesity and lung disease, just because you claim the personal car is intrinsically superior to other modes of transport.<p>That’s a really dystopian vision of the future and thankfully disconnected from the reality in a lot of major cities which are taking steps to reclaim transportation systems from domination by the personal automobile.')
