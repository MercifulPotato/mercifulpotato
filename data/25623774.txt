Item(by='labcomputer', descendants=None, kids=[25629757, 25625847], score=None, time=1609698675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621726, text='&gt; We would like to believe that things top at phase 2 but here again i think we reached all the way to 5.<p>Frankly, I think you&#x27;re way off base here.<p>* First:<p>In an offline cold-start scenario, it is literally impossible to compute a first fix in less time than it takes for the satellite to send the relevant parts of the navigation message.<p>For Navstar&#x27;s (the US brand of GPS) L1 C&#x2F;A (civilian) signals specifically, that means you must receive an entire frame, which is transmitted once every 30 seconds.  So 30 seconds is the lower bound, assuming you receive it correctly the first time.  And L2 doesn&#x27;t contain any ECC, so you&#x27;d want to receive it at least twice and take a majority vote for each bit...<p>The story is the same for the new L2-CNAV and L1C CNAV-2 signals (which have ECC, so once is enough), except that the repetition rate is every 12 and 18 seconds, respectively (but they have lower S&#x2F;N ratio).  If you want the entire GPS almanac, that takes a minimum of 12.5 minutes of airtime for exactly the same reason.<p>So, the idea that GPS chip manufacturers have already forgot how to do offline cold starts is a bit silly.<p>* Second:<p>Devices already use cell tower and wifi AP locations to make fast, low-accuracy, low-energy position estimates.  GPS is used specifically in the scenarios where internet connectivity is not available and&#x2F;or when more accuracy is needed.  I&#x27;ve met a lot of dumb PMs, but I&#x27;m having trouble imagining a PM who wouldn&#x27;t understand that <i>not having cell towers available for a gross position</i> is one of the prime scenarios for powering up the GPS chip.<p>* Third:<p>GPS absolutely requires up to date orbital parameters for each satellite it&#x27;s using.  Who is going to constantly ping the server for up to date ephemerides every 30 seconds when the GPS chip can give you them for free?  Bandwidth is cheap, but it&#x27;s not free, especially when you have millions of devices in the field.   The problem with this approach would be immediately obvious in testing, the first time a device tries to roam across wifi networks.')
