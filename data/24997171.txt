Blockchains, Git commits, directory trees not supporting links, that sort of thing. (Mind you, for practical reasons many systems will still prefer to invert the tree and probably even traverse from leaf to root; this most obvious way is not actually a good fit for computers a lot of the time, even if it’s conceptually beautiful.) But if your graph is not directed, then ownership is not clear (A → B means A owns B, but with A ↔ B you can’t have both A owning B and B owning A), and if it can be cyclic, single ownership definitely falls apart.')
