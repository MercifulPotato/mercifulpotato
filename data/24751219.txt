Because for the life of me, perhaps literally, I don&#x27;t have a better heuristic for judging a doctor than gut feeling.

AM radio ads? Billboards about proton therapy? Internet search? Hearsay? Whoever your insurance company picks?<p>At least I know how to evaluate a programmer for life and death work, like avionics.
