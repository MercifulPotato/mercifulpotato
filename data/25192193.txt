You can compile it if you have the source. Commercial software (binaries) are often unable to be run outside of their target cpu and flavor of Unix though. Apple is a little different in that FAT binaries can contain multiple architectures and even binaries that are not built for the current arch are automatically run in an emulated environment.<p>Solaris had a mechanism where one could place binaries in arch-specific folders (eg: &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sparcv9) and even per-arch library paths but it was definitely opt-in with varying levels of adoption.<p>Iâ€™ve also seen some pretty fun hacks to start qemu in Linux for certain non-native executables. Still not nearly as complete&#x2F;smooth&#x2F;user-friendly as the fat binary&#x2F;library approach.')
