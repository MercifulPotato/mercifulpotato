Not everything that can detect lies is a lie detector.<p>(And not everything called a &quot;lie detector&quot; can detect lies, either. A polygraph test doesn&#x27;t detect lies at all... and yet it is exactly the type of test banned. In fact, that&#x27;s one of the main reasons why it <i>is</i> banned: because it doesn&#x27;t work for its stated purpose.)')
