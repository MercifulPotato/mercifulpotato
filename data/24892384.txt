So, is Nubank worried about doing the right thing, or to please Internet activists?<p>The interview itself was very &quot;wokey&quot;; one interviewer even asked why they don&#x27;t offer very low-interest minimum payments on credit cards... funny thing to ask from a company that does not generate a profit.')
