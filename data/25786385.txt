Dropped Facebook, no more economist subscription, no papers, never had TV. That doesn&#x27;t mean holding a hard line and hiding your head in a pillow. There is enough overflow from HN, the radio, friends, occasional newspapers. \nIt seems I have a much healthier laid back attitude to work, friends, family. I see them all uptight about some event. Following news story breathlessly, fuming or arguing. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m trying to calm every one down, don&#x27;t worry about it, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Political parties change, administration doesn&#x27;t. Think about long term goals, and affects you can have on  that. Skip the day to day arguments.\nThere is so, much valuable news and information on HN, and so much valuable discussion, often from experts in their field. (More rare lately?)\nYou can gather your data, and solve most of your issues, from links provided in HN. So many interesting intellectual topics to pursue. For example:\nNeed covid numbers? Look at worldometers.com\nKeep it up Dang.')
