I believe a _very_ big part of why people feel they need microservices is because of poor architecture and a lack of boundaries in a monolith. Every single monolith I&#x27;ve come across has had issues with circular dependencies and no real contracts between &quot;apps&quot; (as they are called in Django).<p>I believe people see ORMs such as Django&#x27;s as a way to perform one big query as opposed to many small queries. The big query spans 3 apps and 8 models. You have these things sprinkled throughout the codebase and you end up with a big ball of mud.')
