You can&#x27;t reasonably deny the importance of economic factors, but attributing all of war to economics is a very opinionated view and I would argue pretty specific to a particular academic school of thought. I&#x27;m reminded of Stringer Bell in &quot;The Wire,&quot; trying to use his business school lessons to evaluate every part of the drug trade. Avon stops him mid-sentence and says, &quot;String, this ain&#x27;t about your business class. This ain&#x27;t that part of it. It&#x27;s that other thing.&quot; Sometimes that&#x27;s true of war, too.')
