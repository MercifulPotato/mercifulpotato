If we&#x27;re talking about retail and restaurants and bars, then sure, the loss of those things will make it less attractive to live in&#x2F;near those locations.<p>But if we&#x27;re talking about office buildings, and the reason for the collapse is because people don&#x27;t need&#x2F;want offices at all (not because those offices are moving elsewhere), then I think it&#x27;ll have a much smaller effect on the residential markets.<p>What I think has a higher chance of hurting residential markets would be hiring moving away from HCoL areas because companies believe that most workers can be remote (and workers in LCoL areas are cheaper comp-wise).  That hiring movement already seems to be happening, though SF home prices haven&#x27;t changed much.  There might just be a delayed response to that, though.')
