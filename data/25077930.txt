(System76&#x27;s distribution built on top of Ubuntu) on it. Everything including fingerprint scanner works; I once had it hang when resuming from suspend but I mostly don&#x27;t use sleep&#x2F;suspend so wasn&#x27;t too bothered. If you buy the laptop from System76, I would assume everything would basically just work since they are configuring everything.')
