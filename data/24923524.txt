But plants die, and rot, and some amount of that carbon (all, at the limit) ends up right back in the atmosphere.<p>I happen to think that planting poplar, making it into charcoal on an industrial scale, and using the biochar as a soil amendment to mitigate topsoil depletion, is severely underutilized as a carbon capture strategy.  We should be doing enormous amounts of this, instead of... basically none.<p>But it isn&#x27;t &quot;just plant trees&quot;. There&#x27;s more to the job than that.
