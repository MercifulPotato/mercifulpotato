Portland needs facial recognition. It has criminal rioters regularly breaking the law without any consequence. The city’s leadership is allowing violence in the name of political goals to continue unchecked, and is weakening their police department’s ability to uphold the law and enforce it equally upon everyone. Having facial recognition would at least help a department with limited resources act more efficiently. Instead of relying on random luck and memory to spot a suspect while on patrol, it reduces the search to potential matches that have a much higher likelihood of being apprehended and charged.<p>Those concerned about false positives should keep in mind that there is always a human in the loop to confirm matches - which makes the overall system ultimately no less accurate than a human’s ability to spot a suspect randomly. It doesn’t make sense to arbitrarily limit the use of technology here any less than it would to ban a police department’s access to electricity or other utilities.\nYou either believe in having a police department (in which case you want it to be effective and efficient) or you don’t believe that and are okay with police being abolished. The gray space in the middle doesn’t make logical sense to me.')
