You aren&#x27;t taught that 56,437 is odd, it just is.<p>IMHO this isn&#x27;t a thing that needs to be&#x2F;should be remembered. It isn&#x27;t about being taught if zero is odd or even. This is more about people understanding the world around them, people integrating math and science into their world view, instead of as a separate thing they had to do back in school.')
