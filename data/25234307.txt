Sure, there is some flying involved<p>I recently watched some videos of people doing plane checklists; one had an error within two minutes, another had only one pilot doing the checklist while the other was away.  I&#x27;ve also heard that humans skipping items or entire checklists is a general problem.  Out of curiosity, would people with borderline or genuine OCD be a good fit for this?  (Would it be practical to factor out the &quot;checklist compliance&quot; into a separate person?  Seems like &quot;remaining calm in an emergency, quick thinking, judgment and reflexes&quot;, and whatever else I might imagine are best for the pilot are at best orthogonal to &quot;obsessive following of checklists&quot;.)')
