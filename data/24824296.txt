Many people say you essentially can&#x27;t move Ikea furniture between houses because you can&#x27;t dismantle it and if you tried to it&#x27;d simply fall apart.<p>Not only say that. It has happened to me. I bought 3 doors wardrobe with 2 mirror doors. 2 years later I was moving to a different accommodation, wardrobe fall apart when we were holding it above stairs. Only mirror doors were reusable. The rest filled full container for garbage.<p>I&#x27;m all for buy-for-life, so I bought only oak-made furniture since then. I still visit IKEA quite often, but just for plants and clearance section where you can find sheepskin, natural carpets and IoT lights for 1&#x2F;3 of price. They also have really good hot chocolate and cakes :D')
