To be clear, HR always says come to them if I need anything. If I have any problems they are there to help me.<p>Like you said, this is a lie. They are there to follow the law, and if they see you as a liability and your complaint doesn&#x27;t have enough evidence and they can get away with finding a way to get rid of you and claim it&#x27;s not retaliation they will. This happens often.<p>So perhaps HR should take on some responsibility for actively misadvertising  the purpose of their existence. They should say exactly that:<p>We are not here for you we are here to make sure the company doesn&#x27;t get in trouble so if on the books we can be in the right and reduce liability we will, so keep your mouth shut and do not give us any reason to think you are a liability to us.<p>Alot of problems I agree could be solved if HR was honest about their role. And did not advertise themselves as therapists as a way to asses early on if you are a liability and come up with a way to get rid of you and get away with it.')
