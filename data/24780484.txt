The center candidate&#x27;s boundary can be unpredictable, but the other boundaries are in basically the same place as they are for approval and Condorcet. FPTP shifts <i>all</i> the boundaries and drastically reduces or eliminates center candidates&#x27; winning regions. (I&#x27;d also prefer it to Borda, which drastically <i>enlarges</i> center candidates&#x27; winning regions).<p>That said, I agree that approval seems to strike the best balance between simplicity and outcome, with the caveat that where possible we should also have proportional representation rather than winner-take-all districts, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;fair_representation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;fair_representation</a>')
