DSPs had already proven it, and Itanium, Transmeta, and various embedded processors were using it.<p>As a mostly Mac-user back then, I liked PowerPC, and POWER3 was leading the way to 64-bit, but I wasnâ€™t expecting PCs to switch to PowerPC. The RISC systems had not all been executed in the face of the not-yet-released threat of Itanium. I was expecting the diversity to continue, for cross-architecture programming to be the rule and not the exception.')
