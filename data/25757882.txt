The electoral voters are the judges.  The electoral voters are actually able to vote <i>against</i> how their state voted; they might get voted out for doing so, and in some states they will face legal consequences afterward, but their vote still stands.  So even if you think there was a fraud, if you couldn&#x27;t convince your electoral voter, then that&#x27;s it.<p>Well, at least that&#x27;s how it goes in most states.  Looking it up: &quot;In 14 states, votes contrary to the pledge are voided and the respective electors are replaced&quot;.  I guess one could see exactly which states those are, and calculate the possible effects... it would be nice if the above paragraph applied to all of them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faithless_elector#Faithless_elector_laws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faithless_elector#Faithless_el...</a>')
