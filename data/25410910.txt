I got an offer a few months ago but I wanted an extra 100$ on daily rate to justify switch, but they decided against. The Project in question is already at risk, and they are trying to hire for months but HR want to save...<p>The second big problem is proving my abilities. Coding test might be good for baseline ability but you will not discover person leadership skills, organization, drive and mental health&#x2F;strength.

On interview company would pretend how modern and forward thinking they are but in reality everything have yearly roadmap and pets servers on RHEL 5.
