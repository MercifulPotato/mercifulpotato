Item(by='ilaksh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602544395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759929, text='I think we really need to be more specific about working situations than &quot;at home&quot; or &quot;not at home&quot;.<p>Because there are vast differences between specific circumstances.  For example, people who are working at home but also suddenly become substitute teachers to keep their kids on task who are also there, are in a totally different situation than people who have a nice quiet home office and no kids.<p>Also, the specific software setup and operating rules will have a massive difference.  For example, people who need to collaborate daily and don&#x27;t have a good rule for a meeting or a solid whiteboard tool or whatever they need, if they don&#x27;t make that connection adequately, they are going to lag.<p>Or if you are just talking about basic motivation, the interaction rules and software setup will also make a huge difference.  If there were somewhat ad-hoc assignments and check-ins that kept people somewhat more motivated before and then all of that is just dropped, the motivation will go down.  Now ideally what you have instead is just good management, intrinsic motivation and properly chunked-out results-oriented sprints, strong async and written communication, etc.<p>Or in the opposite direction, if the boss realizes that now he doesn&#x27;t need to go stand over your shoulder to check in with you or add a task since he can just message you on Slack at any time, that could also turn into a drag on programmer productivity.<p>So it&#x27;s really dependant on a lot of specific factors and not just whether they are in an office or not.  And I feel like discussions will need to break down some of those details to be useful.')
