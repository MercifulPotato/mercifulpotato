They are valued based on whether people think owning them will earn them a profit in the future.<p>You can certainly wait until a company has proven itself to invest in them. The problem with that is you will never get more than marginal returns. If you waited until Amazon was fairly valued, you&#x27;d probably still be sitting on the sidelines.
