Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612233230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25996674, text='&gt; Painting that as normal is disingenuous, and rightfully led to a very public Oracle JDK exodus.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;painting it as normal.&quot; This is the actual normal. It&#x27;s just that there has always been an update. It is also not true that you cannot continue an updated version past the end of update period.<p>&gt; Azul seems to disagree. They have a JRE7[1] and JRE8[2] offering.<p>They really don&#x27;t. They have an offering of something they call a JRE, but isn&#x27;t. Try to run Applets or Web Start on it.<p>&gt; Old Legacy Java5 Applets aren&#x27;t going to run on Java9+ without other significant changes anyway.<p>Most Java 1.0 applications run on Java unchanged, and the JRE is to run Applet&#x27;s and Web Start. Now there are custom Java runtimes created with jlink.<p>&gt; If I go to Oracle&#x27;s website, it&#x27;s difficult to find where to download any version of Java JRE or JDK without being bombarded with a plethora of &quot;Subscribe and protect your Java investment!&quot;<p>Nope. Here&#x27;s the official JDK from Oracle for non-support customers. You&#x27;ll get bombarded with nothing: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Nothing is wrong with Oracle wanting to charge people to use their binaries<p>But we don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re looking at the support subscription. The website clearly links to the 100% free JDK for people who aren&#x27;t interested in support: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; but I do not believe the distinction of contributing more code matters for the point I am raising.<p>Oracle is to OpenJDK what Google is to Chromium. It is the main developer of OpenJDK (by a <i>huge</i> margin), and the steward of Java. That it&#x27;s changed how it funds its investment in OpenJDK didn&#x27;t change any of that. This is easy to see if you follow OpenJDK&#x27;s development.<p>&gt; the Java8 thing was quite a fiasco<p>What fiasco? You mean that some people insisted on using unmaintained libraries, ignored warnings about undocumented APIs <i>for years</i>, and then, when Oracle upped the investment and things started changing some ill-maintained dependencies broke? You realise that this hadn&#x27;t happened before because they platform wasn&#x27;t changing much because of a decline in investment in Sun&#x27;s dying years?<p>&gt; They&#x27;re OpenJDK source compiled and offered in a binary for free without any strings attached<p>That&#x27;s great, just like Oracle&#x27;s binaries, which, again, are here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdk.java.net&#x2F;</a>')
