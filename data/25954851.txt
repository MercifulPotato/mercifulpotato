Item(by='jkaplowitz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611903854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952889, text='The concern expressed by the cakeshop was primarily about making a custom wedding cake for a gay wedding, not the message. Put differently, they wouldn&#x27;t have made a custom cake for this particular wedding, knowing it was a gay wedding, even if there were no message requested. The ruling was not on free speech grounds.<p>Anyway, the cakeshop scenario is a bit different in another way: it can be argued to involve expressive activity on the part of the employees who create the custom cake, since it&#x27;s far more artistic than mechanical, and since they do literally write any requested message with decoration. By contrast, Discord&#x27;s actions against the customer are simply a choice of which speech by others they choose to allow to flow through the platform they control, plus a statement of their own speech which they choose to put out about their action.<p>(For what it&#x27;s worth, they&#x27;ve chosen to partially reverse their ban since we started out discussion, if I understand right.)<p>If you want to ensure there is a content neutral platform, maybe the best way (at least under US free speech concepts) is to advocate for a government-owned&#x2F;run Internet group communication platform, just like we have in offline life when you go to the nearby park or plaza to protest, or when you send mail to everyone in your local community through USPS.<p>Everyone agrees that, in the US, the government can&#x27;t constitutionally censor that on the basis of content or viewpoint, with a few exceptions such as forbidding child pornography. I&#x27;m guessing that platform wouldn&#x27;t keep getting funding from the politicians if it got too much offensive content, but if it wasn&#x27;t shut down entirely, they couldn&#x27;t be selective about which speech to permit.')
