Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606554093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236244, text='&gt; Parents don&#x27;t need daycare if they only work half of the time. (Of course, this means owning less.)<p>Many parents are not wealthy enough to have the choice you&#x27;re implying any more.<p>First, if they earn half the time, that means part-time work which generally means earning less than half the wages because companies tend to use a full time employee for higher value work.<p>Second, if they are renters, they don&#x27;t &quot;own less&quot; by earning less than half.  Instead, they might (for example) go from being able to afford the rent on a place to raise a family, to being able to afford the rent on a room in a shared house which is unsuitable.<p>If they own a place (with a mortgage), they&#x27;d go from buying a place which is big enough to not being able to afford to buy a place, because they won&#x27;t even be granted a mortgage for a family-size home on a single typical income.<p>&gt; Offshore money doesn&#x27;t matter for the economy. Actually it improves the life of the 99% because the value of their money would decrease if the offshore money would join the onshore money circulation.<p>The parent comment is referring to the lost taxes due to trading profits being creatively accounted to hide them in offshore reservoirs.  If paid those taxes would improve the life of the 99%.<p>As for the value of onshore money decreasing if offshore money were to join it, it&#x27;s not that simple because much of that additional circulation would end up <i>inside the pockets of the 99%</i>.')
