The world appears to contain life which feeds on life, so on some level it’s entirely necessary in order for life to continue as we know it. I know that I can make a choice to feed on life (or at least life like my own) less but I have no way of knowing that about anything else.<p>My intuition is that most animals can’t or don’t distinguish much in what life they feed on and so if they eat humans, it’s simply according to nature and not problematic in the least.')
