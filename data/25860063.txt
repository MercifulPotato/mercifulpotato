They are 8 state machines that can toggle IO at &quot;light speed&quot; - the system clock rate - based on a small assembly program, with lots of hardware accelerated FIFOs and shifting.<p>The datasheet for the accelerators is pretty rich and well written with a ton of examples (an oddity for typically poorly-documented state machines - looking at you, i.MX DMA).<p>Someone had fun with it (and it also pretty clearly makes the point that these are not general purpose coprocessor accelerators):<p>&gt; Although not designed for computation, PIO is quite likely Turing-complete, and it is conjectured that it could run DOOM,\ngiven a sufficiently high clock speed. [...] A full 32-bit addition takes only around one minute at 125 MHz.<p>&gt; &#x2F;&#x2F; Pop quiz: how many additions does the processor do when calling this function [to set up the PIO addition program]<p>Lol.')
