They state that they achieved high speed-ups from not doing any coordination because they encode each state as a &quot;private field&quot; in an actor. Actors then communicate via queues (assume ZeroMQ from their reference), which require coordination to scale at some point - so do the actors that contain the actual data.<p>I do see some market for (eventual&#x2F;in)-consistent databases though, so maybe that&#x27;s something we are going to see much more often in the future.')
