When I look at say LinkedIn’s job boards I see maybe 20-30% percent spam postings from many different faceless agencies all trying to recruit for the same garbage positions and maybe 70-80% jobs that the board determines as similar enough to my current and previous work which is not always why I want. It’s so bad to the point where I can search for a job completely separate position, completely unrelated to programming and a number of the hits will be generic software development jobs. Now there is one thing I will concede that LinkedIn does  alright on the features. There are separate filters for job position and company industry. This is really nice if you’re interested in hunting out something specific. Most other job boards I’m familiar with  have all the spam and filter problems without the annoying “smart” features.<p>Aside from that most of my issues are with job listings themselves and the lack of useful information in them.')
