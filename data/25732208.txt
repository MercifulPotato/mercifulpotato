Got it a couple years back to replace the bulky secondhand rackmounts I&#x27;d been using as build hosts&#x2F;hypervisors&#x2F;fileservers etc.<p>I appreciate the open platform and documentation behind it -- the OpenPOWER people publish a lot of detailed technical docs, and all the source code is available, with everything down to the FPGAs controlling power-up easily modifiable, without having to reverse-engineer all the bits like <i>cough</i> other platforms.<p>It&#x27;s just a shame it started off expensive and has gotten even more so the past couple of years. I suppose it&#x27;s just what happens when you&#x27;re producing such complex boards at such a tiny scale, and for such a niche audience.')
