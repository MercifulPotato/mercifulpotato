Should the government stop printing cash?<p>Your comparisons are apples and oranges to this PornHub situation.  It&#x27;s not a rebuttal to mechanically list other things that might have some associated negative tradeoffs.  You have weigh both the severity of the problem, the benefits, and the alternatives.<p>&gt; PH doesn’t seem to be throw their hands up, either. They deploy algorithms similar to other social media &#x2F; video websites to detect illegal content.<p>PornHub has taken a &quot;laissez faire with cleanup&quot; model for their porn uploads, which frankly invites abuse that&#x27;s difficult to clean up (as the Kristof outlined).  That might work for a site like Facebook, which <i>bans porn outright</i>, so it doesn&#x27;t have to worry so much about the distinction between underage and of-age porn, since it&#x27;s <i>all</i> forbidden.  PornHub&#x27;s a porn site, however, so their moderation already starts at a disadvantage.  A preclearance model (with identity verification), while more expensive, doesn&#x27;t have the abuse potential of laissez faire; and given the severity of abuse here, is for more appropriate.')
