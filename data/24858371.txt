He was only ever relating in the NT what the Old testament was teaching. So it&#x27;s very easy to understand what he was saying if you reference what he was quoting.<p>On sexuality being innate&#x2F;not a choice. The Bible does not prohibit any innate characteristics, it prohibits actions. Actions are always choices.
