Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[24857322, 24856353], score=None, time=1603352637, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855449, text='HTTP&#x2F;1 is a plain text protocol over TCP. Requests are sequential per connection. Browsers tend to use up to six connections at a time to work around this.<p>HTTP&#x2F;2 is a binary protocol over TCP. Requests are multiplexed. It’s normally better than HTTP&#x2F;1, but in environments with higher packet loss rates (e.g. remote mobile networks) it can perform markedly worse than HTTP&#x2F;1, because of TCP head-of-line blocking and the fact that the browser is now using only one connection.<p>HTTP&#x2F;3 is a binary protocol over QUIC which is over UDP. Requests are multiplexed. If it works, it <i>should</i> be fairly uniformly better than both HTTP&#x2F;1 and HTTP&#x2F;2, because you can think of it as roughly HTTP&#x2F;2 minus the bad parts of TCP. However, on a few networks (business networks typically, I think) it won’t work because they have firewalls that hate unknown UDP traffic.<p>(HTTP&#x2F;3 is not <i>actually</i> just HTTP&#x2F;2 over QUIC; HTTP&#x2F;2’s header compression scheme HPACK is stateful in a way that depends on TCP’s sequential nature so that it couldn’t work over QUIC without completely reintroducing the head-of-line blocking problem, so it’s replaced with a variant that mitigates that problem substantially, called QPACK. But other than that, I <i>think</i> they’re roughly the same. Don’t quote me on that, though, it’s a few years since I read the specs and I’ve forgotten it all, not to mention that the specs have changed plenty in that time.)<p>I think this is a fair summary, but I don’t have any practical experience with HTTP&#x2F;3, so I welcome any corrections.')
