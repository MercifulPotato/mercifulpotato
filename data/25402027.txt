I&#x27;ve worked on projects with some unholy combination of (gnu) Makefiles and VS Solutions. I&#x27;ve never &quot;got&quot; Visual Studio and have always found it very jarring -- but I mostly don&#x27;t use windows much, and that always feels like it has a way of thinking that is...very orthogonal to mine. KDevelop has honestly been the best &quot;not in your face&quot; IDE I&#x27;ve personally found. I mostly do not do any MacOS programming, but when I have occasionally played, I&#x27;ve realised that xcode is brilliant but it seems like it utterly reinvents itself every major revision number. Eclipse, something I rarely-if-never used has sunk from a popular zeitgeist without a trace. Many of my colleagues (in a medical imaging setting) use jupyter, RStudio or Matlab, occasionally venturing into julia.<p>The winds shift, and the ship of progress sails a direction that is difficult to chart, but vim....vim never changes, and for that I am very glad.')
