Probably a lot of both, and maybe yes a bit too much of the former.<p>But in any case their reply is, “We would rather take the risk.”<p>If they get sick and die like your grandma (condolences), they will have done so at least partially by choice, a choice which they have damn well earned by their mid-nineties.
