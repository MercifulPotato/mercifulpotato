Intel has a P&#x2F;E ratio of less than 10 with strongly growing revenue and eps (even boring old IBM and Dell have much higher P&#x2F;E ratios). Why? Because the market has no confidence it can sustain these earnings over the long term.<p>EDIT: From Motley Fool<p>&gt; Once the head of the pack in computer processors, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is coming under serious attack in its core business. Rival big tech companies are opting to develop their own chips, with the latest being mighty Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). On Friday&#x27;s news that Microsoft is doing the go-it-alone thing, Intel&#x27;s stock fell by 6.3% on the day.')
