We did a Show HN for AirSend 6 months ago - thank you again for your support! Since then the product has come a long way. We’ve added many major functionalities based on feedback and wanted to share those with you today.<p>As a reminder, AirSend (www.airsend.io) lets you instantly collaborate. Send messages, have voice&#x2F;video calls, share and organize files, manage tasks, and keep notes all in one place.<p>AirSend could potentially replace Slack, Dropbox, and Trello for small teams. It’s our moonshot attempt to redefine how teams communicate and collaborate. We like it and hope you like it too.<p>Here’s a summary of AirSend’s best functionalities:<p>Super Powered Messaging - Ultra-fast messaging from any device (web, desktop and mobile). Includes read receipts and supports both 1-1 and group chats.<p>Unlimited free voice&#x2F;video calls and screen-sharing - Enough said. :)<p>Secure Private Channels - Lets you collaborate with clients and team members easily and securely.<p>Public Channels for customer support - Startups, indie developers, or anyone else can easily make a public chatroom to gather feedback and answer questions on products.<p>Built-in file storage (free up to 100GB) - Store and organize your files directly within Channels with automatic versioning and a convenient central file view.<p>Built-in Wiki to keep notes - Each Channel has a built-in Wiki with Latex and full Markdown support.<p>Built-in task management - Track and complete your to-do.<p>Desktop apps for Windows, Mac and Linux - Dark mode included. Enough said. :)<p>G-Suite and Office 365 integration - Easily send emails from Gmail to AirSend with our add-on, and collaborate on documents with AirSend’s Office 365 Integration.<p>And that’s what we’ve been working on. We’d love for your to check us out (we&#x27;re offering AirSend Pro free for a year for anyone who signs up before January 15), and thank you again for your continued support!')
