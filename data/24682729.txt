That could work for roads. It&#x27;s not much fun, but in Russia often houses don&#x27;t have an asphalted roads next to them. but perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t work for pipes, because of hygiene reasons. Perhaps owners can be made to pay for at least some of those pipes through fees for the homeowners association rather than taxes. That way the excess is off the city balance sheet. Houses that are too far away from central infrastructure would just be vacated eventually. Maybe in time more efficient cost sharing appartments would replace these.')
