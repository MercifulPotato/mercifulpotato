If &quot;unsafe&quot; and &quot;marginalized&quot; do not describe their situation, then the words have no meaning.<p>As a minority from one of the groups at the unflattering end of the crime rate distributions, it is my <i></i>lived experience<i></i> that the type of censorship you are advocating for is what makes me feel unsafe.<p>Inconvenient empirical truths about my community can not be discussed in the sort of polite and caring settings where the seeds of real solutions that don&#x27;t ignore reality could germinate.<p>Instead, they can only be discussed in rude and hateful settings.')
