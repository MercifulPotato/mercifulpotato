On the other hand, this is totally the wrong approach and it will teach you the wrong lessons.<p>The idea that you can just treat data as a uniform dump of tables and that grinding your way to high numbers is somehow worthwhile is simply terrible. The resulting systems won&#x27;t work well in the real world and they produce horrific explanations of what is going on. This class teaches you not just the wrong tools, like boosting, it teaches you the wrong mental model.<p>I really can&#x27;t think of a worse introduction to ML than this class. Even not knowing anything would actually be better.')
