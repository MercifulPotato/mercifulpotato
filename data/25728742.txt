This has moderate success for brave bicycle riders but probably is not a safe for less brave riders around cars that aren&#x27;t used to bicycles.<p>I keep trying to point my local government, since they&#x27;ve already taken my money anyway, towards the Bentonville model. Instead of building bike lanes, build single track that runs through the town. This has been incredibly successful for them. Instead of building sidewalks they build dirt paths.<p>The other option is streamway buffer trails which completely remove bikes from traffic and provide shortcuts without red lights through the city.')
