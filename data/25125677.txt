I would avoid those who won&#x27;t like the plague, not just as a potential significant other but even as a friend. I&#x27;m not saying that everyone who has lost custody of their child or doesn&#x27;t see their child much is a horrible person, but I am saying that those people who aren&#x27;t even _interested_ in raising their own children are not generally the kind of people I want influencing me. Parenthood is difficult, some people try really hard and it beats them, and there shouldn&#x27;t be any shame in that, there should be help. I&#x27;m also not talking about people in that category.')
