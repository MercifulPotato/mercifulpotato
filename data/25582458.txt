It doesn&#x27;t seem to adequately take weather &#x2F; saftey into account.<p>When there is a serious snow storm or blizzard Google Maps will inevitably tell me to use an old (but still used) county road, rather than the interstate.  I assume that google thinks this path has less traffic (true) and is faster (very much not true):<p>1.  Due to weather conditions it is very much NOT faster, but I suspect due to the lack of traffic it seems faster than the slow interstate.   Plowing through this county road is quite slow in reality, but the recommendation always remains...<p>2.  This is NOT a road you want to be on during a blizzard or heavy snow event.   It is not plowed as often as the interstate, and there is little to no shoulder so if you slide around even a little there&#x27;s a super high chance you end up in a DEEP ditch.<p>Even worse sometimes it redirects people through local neighborhoods that are plowed even LESS often, presumably because it assumes the lower amount of traffic = faster, again that&#x27;s wrong on every level.<p>In reality plodding along on the heavily plowed interstate is both faster, AND safer, but Google Maps seems to be unable to recognize this during these kinds of conditions.')
