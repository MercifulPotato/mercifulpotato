At a certain point, society shouldn&#x27;t allow the selfish acts of small group of individuals undermine the well-being of society at large.<p>Obviously, there would need to be ample warning and a concerted effort to educate everyone on consequences.  Once these requirements are met in this hypothetical, I believe the moral thing to do is to stop wearing masks and stop social distancing.<p>That said, this is an idealized hypothetical.  In reality, there will be many people who can&#x27;t get vaccinated for reasons that are not selfish.  In this case, there is still a moral dilemma, but I&#x27;m unsure on how I&#x27;d approach it.  Surely, asking 200 million people to wear masks for another year to save 1 life isn&#x27;t worth it.  The question is where to draw the line.')
