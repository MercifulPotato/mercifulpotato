The ability to detect a molecule might evolve based on immune responses that use random sequences as &quot;test&quot; active sites that are checked for a specific type of deformation.<p>If this random sequence deforms immediately, it is discarded because this sequence either deforms automatically or deforms in the presence of something common to &quot;host&quot;.<p>If the test remains negative it is released from the host training environment. If the test pattern deforms some time later, it has detected a &quot;foreign&quot; molecule, and has the potential for use as part of a protein that manipulates this molecule.<p>Recovering the sequence that detects this new foreign molecule becomes the first step in a hereditary immunity. It also stores this useful sequence for possible use in other &quot;testing&quot; systems. These might bring 3 or 4 of these random test systems together to perform another test.<p>Simple systems that explore a complex space can come up with seemingly elegant solutions.<p>The most obvious answer to any of your questions is that, if it worked a different way, that&#x27;s what the video would show... or there would be no video at all.')
