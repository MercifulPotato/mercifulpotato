They need someone that will say to wall street “Hey, I am going to focus on doing something new and revolutionary that will pay off in the long term, but might hurt profits for a few years. If you do not like it then sell the stock.” That CEO will need a board of the same mind to make it work. There is not a quick fix here, however there is a company of very talented people that if given the right leadership can drive new outcomes. Remember, Dr. Su at AMD did exactly this.')
