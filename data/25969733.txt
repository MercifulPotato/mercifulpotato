On Linux, I can use Arch and have the latest of all software - which means I have the disadvantage of having to stay up-to-date on things like dhcpcd and systemd and coreutils.  I don&#x27;t want to have the latest versions of these things or spend time routinely upgrading them piecemeal.<p>Or I can use Debian stable and everything is stable, but if I want something new I have to compile it myself, or hope there&#x27;s a backport.<p>With macOS and Macports I get a stable base system that Apple keeps up-to-date security-wise with monolithic updates that I don&#x27;t have to worry about, and Macports has the latest for things like Emacs or even the GNU coreutils.')
