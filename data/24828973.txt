Coupled logic that seems correct now may need to be uncoupled in the future.<p>By having every sector of logic be ungrouped it leads to maximum reusability for the future.<p>Technical debt is at the lowest possible level in projects where every piece of logic is uncoupled. In fact the very phenomenon of Technical debt arises from logic that&#x27;s hard to uncouple. By having every sector of your program be a lego brick you are preparing your program for an inevitable future where the structure must be reconfigured.<p>Grouping logic together is like super gluing lego bricks together because it seems like they belong together.<p>There&#x27;s a term for this style of coding that&#x27;s actually negative. It&#x27;s called ravioli code. But the negativity mostly applies to when this style of coding is used in OOP.')
