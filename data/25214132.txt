When you need to accept information from anonymous users (comments, votes, forms, registrations), there&#x27;s no way to not invade users privacy <i>and</i> not waste their time, unless you are manually filtering &#x2F; moderating all the input data, in which case you can&#x27;t really say it scales. You might say emails can solve the problem. Well, they don&#x27;t really solve the problem against dedicated attackers &#x2F; spammers, and they do invade privacy for the average user. You can use statistical approaches to try to reduce privacy invasion or others, but I don&#x27;t know of anything that really <i>solves</i> the problem without manual identity verification at some point.')
