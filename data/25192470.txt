I found this to be very helpful, not just for understanding convolution per se, but as a lesson that one should try to use physical intuition to model mathematical concepts whenever one can.<p>&gt; More generally, if one thinks of functions as fuzzy versions of points, then convolution is the fuzzy version of addition (or sometimes multiplication, depending on the context). The probabilistic interpretation is one example of this (where the fuzz is a a probability distribution), but one can also have signed, complex-valued, or vector-valued fuzz, of course.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;5892&#x2F;what-is-convolution-intuitively" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathoverflow.net&#x2F;questions&#x2F;5892&#x2F;what-is-convolution-...</a>')
