When someone makes a truly secure piece of software, they get a PhD and repeatedly make the HN front-page. [0]<p>It&#x27;s not just a matter of writing code with no bugs, though. As I mentioned this another comment, [1] voting is unusual as we must be confident in the correctness of the count, <i>and</i> confident that it&#x27;s not possible to prove whether a particular person voted a particular way. There&#x27;s also a trust issue: with a digital system, a single corrupt official will likely be able to do far more damage to the vote than with a paper-based system. Even if the system is somehow structured to resist this, public trust might still be less than in a  paper-based system.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ts.data61.csiro.au&#x2F;projects&#x2F;seL4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ts.data61.csiro.au&#x2F;projects&#x2F;seL4&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25048971" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25048971</a>')
