Put simply, a country that issues its\nown currency can never run out and can never become insolvent in its own currency. It can make\nall payments as they come due.”  As a result, “for most governments, there is no\ndefault risk on government debt.”<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate how dangerous this statement is.<p>It&#x27;s definitely an interesting intellectual approach to some interesting ideas, but pragmatically, it boils down to the same thing: debts don&#x27;t matter, so just print money.<p>It&#x27;s immediately suicidal for any non-large nation, obviously history shows this, because nobody will want the currency, hyperinflation ensues, economic crashes etc..<p>For larger, more established nations with currencies that have externalizations, it&#x27;s a very risky game to play.<p>Remember that government is under constant money pressure. &#x27;The Budget&#x27; is 90% of the real debate in governance.<p>Currently, they can tax, or raise debt. The former is politically difficult, the later - they have to face market reality.<p>MMT basically says &#x27;just print money&#x27;. It&#x27;s basically using the nuclear option to take over the entire economy by undermining the system we use to measure it: money.<p>Money really drives incentives, distorts realities. I have no doubt so many politicians &#x27;think they know better&#x27; and that &#x27;if only they had several more billion the country would be so much better&#x27;, it&#x27;s a deep instinct. We need realities to counterbalance our fantasies however well intentioned.<p>Here are some examples of hyperinflation in the last century, at the end of the day, they all have the same root cause [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperinflationary_periods" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperin...</a><p>Edit: note that we are engaging in an MMT experiment right now. During this &#x27;giant crisis&#x27; everyone is hosed, and so everyone is doing &#x27;funny money things&#x27;. The market understands the situation however, and interprets such actions as &#x27;responsible actions during a crisis&#x27; - but nevertheless a crisis. So the debt overhang is a real problem, but it can be excused as rational.<p>Politicians wanting to do the same spending (equivalent to 20 years deficits, like here in Canada) on some &#x27;National XYZ Project&#x27; will not be treated the same way, unless that National Project boils down to &#x27;getting money out of the ground i.e. Oil&#x27;. In some developing nations, &#x27;accepted, obvious infrastructure&#x27; investments like electricity and roads.<p>The Fed did a little bit of this in 2008 when they took a zillion in bad mortgages onto the balance sheets. It&#x27;s &#x27;pain free&#x27; in the short term, but the moral dilemma really exists: the market basically accepted the failure of banks - and - all the people taking big mortgages and bailed them out. Who would have been the &#x27;winners&#x27; of a housing crisis? Well, renters for one - as long as they kept their jobs. But the crisis was so big, socialization was the only answer.<p>I think it should be looked upon like a Hospital stay: pumping the patient full of drugs is helpful in a crisis, but said drugs are plainly not helpful for ongoing development of that individual. Proponents would say &#x27;it&#x27;s like Tylenol&#x27; I would say it&#x27;s more like &#x27;Morphene&#x27;.')
