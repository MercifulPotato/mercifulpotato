Item(by='Smaug123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603119353, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825102, text='I mean, it&#x27;sâ€¦ true? My own (very highly upvoted) comment on the main thread of this article contains the text &quot;I only took four lectures of General Relativity before I gave it up in favour of computability and logic&quot;, which is helpful context for anyone who reads it, because it lets the reader know in a fairly objective sense that I am familiar with some of the concepts of GR but am unlikely to understand everything in detail. You can&#x27;t know whether someone on the Internet knows what they&#x27;re talking about, but they can give you some of their context to help you decide. Admittedly &quot;a good school&quot; is not the most useful context, but it&#x27;s better than no context.')
