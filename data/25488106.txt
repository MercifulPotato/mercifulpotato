With cloud tooling, my team is unblocked to spin up the resources we need, manage CI &#x2F; CD in our unique way that solves our problems, quickly try out serverless if it’s a good model for a given use case, change logging or alerting, get new compute resources like GPUs, etc., all without being blocked by a choke point of in house engineering limitations and staffing limitations and political in-fighting over who owns what and who gets to define how abstract vs purpose-specific the tooling will be.<p>You toss out “build a good CI&#x2F;CD pipeline” like that’s just some localized, solvable problem, and it’s exactly that lack of imagination and lack of understanding about the true multitude of use cases that causes this problem in the first place.<p>I agree “serverless” isn’t a panopoly solution to everything, but externalizing and democratizing all infra tools to cloud vendors is a major transformative solution that is worth a lot of money and solves a lot of problems.<p>For example, if someone like you had any leadership influence in my company’s infra org, I’d be trying to spend money on cloud tools just to get away from your authority as fast as I could, and I would be 1000% correct to feel that way and would end up with much healthier tool solutions and less blockages on use-case-specific delivery requirements by doing a giant spin move around your myopic perspective.')
