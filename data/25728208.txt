Item(by='ryanlol', descendants=None, kids=[25728275], score=None, time=1610369446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728126, text='&gt; I am quite aware how un-ergonomic such a messenger would be so I know that Telegram does little more than TLS protection of the network socket. And that&#x27;s fine with me and with millions of others.<p>The amount of people who understand this certainly isn’t in the millions. The fact is that most Telegram users have no idea that their conversations aren’t encrypted, most people incorrectly assume that it’s more secure than whatsapp.<p>&gt; WhatsApp threads I&#x27;ve seen lately only aim at the user&#x27;s data privacy and almost nobody ever mentions that their &quot;encryption&quot; is also a glorified TLS and their claims for end-to-end encryption are very likely dubious and a pure PR stunt.<p>This is complete nonsense. Whatsapp uses the Signal Protocol. Their claims of end-to-end encryption are true (and easily verifiable! just pull out the debugger of your choice)<p>&gt; Admittedly some of the responses earlier -- which were very unconstructive -- got to me.<p>I think your (perfectly understandable) misinterpretation was corrected in a rather polite manner, but you still wanted to argue after being corrected by multiple native english speakers.')
