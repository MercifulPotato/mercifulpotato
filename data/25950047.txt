They&#x27;re part of his non-Culture novels.<p>Against a Dark Background is The Culture without advanced AIs or intergalactic space travel. It&#x27;s essentially a heist&#x2F;chase novel about a character looking for a certain weapon of mass destruction. The central metaphor of the novel is the main character&#x27;s isolation, mirrored by a planetary system that is too far away from any nearby galaxies to ever develop the technology reach the stars. It&#x27;s a very, very bleak novel, but it also has that energy that powers Banks&#x27; best noves.<p>The Algebraist is mostly just fun and lightweight. The premise is great: Humankind has been able to scatter across the galaxy thanks to a network of wormhole gates allowing instant travel, but since each wormhole gate takes a hundred years or so to be transported into a new location, this puts each location at huge risk of being isolated for a very, very long time if their gate is destroyed. Which, of course, exactly is what happens.')
