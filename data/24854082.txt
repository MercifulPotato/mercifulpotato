I found out I had kidney cancer after my appendix decided it was time to go. I only had 3% of my left kidney removed and that is it. No chemo or anything just sore for a few weeks.<p>And man do I have guilt and felt like a fake cancer survivor. My experience was so minimal compared to a lot of people. But I realized I am a cancer survivor because of all the mental anguish cancer puts on me. Itâ€™s nothing I can ever explain, it is just this super terrible feeling of not knowing. Is my cough metastasized cancer? Probably not but my mind sure loves to think so. Having to deal with my own mortality was a big thing. I wonder if dying of old age causes as much stress and anxiety as knowing you have cancer and could die.')
