Once, I took LSD with a couple of &quot;friends&quot; of mine, which turned out to be a sort of devil-worshiping ritual to indoctrinate me into their cult. Apparently all of them had went through this process where they played a niche genre of music called &quot;darkpsy&quot; which is absolutely horrendous to your ears.<p>From my experience of the event, I can say with complete confidence that when they were drugged and this ritual was done to them, they had no will-power to break away because the potency of the drug is quite high and the power of suggestibility is through the roof. You become the group on LSD. I think to perform such a evil thing another person, you absolutely need to have lost your soul and I&#x27;m pretty sure they were hard-core devil believers at that point.<p>The moment I started getting the &quot;bad vibes&quot; I just got the out of that house and had to trip alone by myself in a strange area for the next 12 hours. I had one of the worst experiences of my life for that 12 hours where I was rampantly paranoid about what went down and couldn&#x27;t trust anyone for a week. Currently seeking therapy for this now.')
