With retaliation if the person(s) didn’t comply.<p>For instance, the building manager could withhold things you needed. The gangs would also ensure they’d get preferential treatment from their aldermen, etc.<p>No idea if this was effective in influencing any outcomes.<p>My biggest concern with widespread mail-in voting is ballot stuffing (bribe for votes becomes easier) and abusive relationships forcing their family members (or community members) to vote a certain way by filling in the ballots themselves.<p>There’s a good reason the voting booth is private.')
