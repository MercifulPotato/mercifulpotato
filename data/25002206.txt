I doubt that the business case for that is strong. With autonomous Semis on the horizon, the potential reduction in costs with the scaling of hauling in km &#x2F; day will drive costs down. 300 km a day won’t be competitive in that space.<p>For a buyer of semis, the cost of running one is arguably the most important factor.
