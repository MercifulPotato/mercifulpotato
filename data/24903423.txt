But the way you&#x27;re presenting it makes it sound like a conspiracy theory and truthfully comes off somewhat illogical and paranoid. That takes a lot away from your argument. Maybe there is a conspiracy, but if there is, then you need to back it up with proof or sources.<p>On another note, there is one thing you are absolutely incorrect about: antipsychotics are not ineffective managing many mental health disorders. Large clinical trials are done before these drugs are even approved for the sole purpose of proving they are better than no treatment.')
