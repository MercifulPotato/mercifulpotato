But the high-end just continues to be moving in the other direction, in the case of the example here, bleeding-edge design is moving into the 3D space (my guess is Cinema 4D for the 3D elements on Pitch&#x27;s homepage), and 3D packages are an order of magnitude more complex than either Photoshop or Excel. I.e., instead of taking successful simpler software&#x27;s lead, the high-end is actually getting more complicated.<p>For awhile now I’ve been predicting a moat forming in creative professions between people using high-end (usually desktop) software, and the low-end (either mobile or mobile compatible). Historically, this was never the case, e.g., all designers used Photoshop, all music producers used Logic or similar. Now with truly viable low-end alternatives like the Affinity Suite, and Final Cut deliberately moving down market, or the absolutely rich audio ecosystem on iOS, it’s almost like two “classes” of creator are being formed.<p>Presumably choice is a good thing, but I think more and more the work of people focusing on the high-end is going to stand out from the rest, and career-wise be more in demand.')
