Item(by='franga2000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609977277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664044, text='&gt; How can we spread this sentiment towards services like email and chat too?<p>We can&#x27;t, because those two things are in direct opposition. Piracy was less convenient and offered fewer features that people wanted, so they moved to platforms that were more convenient. The current giants (Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp...) are more convenient than their alternatives (generic email, Mastodon, Signal...) and so the pressure is not to move, but in fact to stay.<p>In general, the pressure is always decentralised-&gt;centralised, which is exactly what torrents-&gt;Netflix was. Even if we had infinite funds to offer people distributed services for free forever, we would still need to make them more convenient than their current centralised ones - if on top of not being more convenient, we also want to charge them, I see no reason why the average person would ever want to switch.')
