For everyone else, it’s not a bait and switch because nothing changed, and for the data hoarders it’s not like it’s a bait and switch because there’s no bait. They knew this day would come, as it always has with every other service that’s ever made a similar offer. The TOS already limited usage in a number of ways, but Google didn’t bother to enforce them because the data hoarders hadn’t made enough of a nuisance of themselves to bother.')
