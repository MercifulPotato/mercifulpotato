Please consult your dictionary.<p>My comment re: homeopathy&#x2F;traditional meds was an attempt to contrast the wild wild west dumpster fire that is Big Pharma with traditional meds. Pill popping countries have an opioid crisis whilst less meat eating populations aren&#x27;t heavily reliant on the pharmaceutical industry because they have far less diet related health issues. In hindsight, I could have phrased that better. Then again, you could have parsed what I was trying to get across.<p>The rest of this must be directed at OP because I too know and believe a plant based diet carries longer life expectancy. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
