I&#x27;ve also interacted with the API Server using a Ruby library that relied on metaprogramming. I could do things in a dozen lines that would require thousands of lines of checked-in Go.<p>Replying to your edit:<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s just a bad idea to write something for Kubernetes that is not in Go, you have 0 support and k8s releases a new version every 6month, good luck keeping up with that.</i><p>Well, a few things.<p>First, using client-go doesn&#x27;t save you from version shifts. It is explicitly unsupported, so if they break your downstream system, stiff shit.<p>Second, client-go is derived from code generators. The same generators also produce other clients. Unfortunately they are terrible, by virtue of OpenAPI generator being a hellish maze and because they leak Go-isms like a spiteful sieve. I&#x27;ve used that code generator to develop a proxy. It sucked.<p>Third, this library is derived independently. It uses the same OpenAPI definitions as client-go, client-java and so forth. It&#x27;s as easy to keep up to date as any of the others.<p>Fourth, the Kubernetes API isn&#x27;t fully tested. Not even close. Many libraries can rightfully claim to be just as conformant as client-go, despite being broken on ~66% of endpoints: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apisnoop.cncf.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apisnoop.cncf.io&#x2F;</a>')
