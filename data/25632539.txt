I simply don&#x27;t want builds to be allowed to reach the complexity that sbt allows.<p>I would definitely agree with your point that most build tools aren&#x27;t easy! I&#x27;ve used maven and grumbled about it, and I&#x27;m mostly sold on scripting my build in the same language I&#x27;m using anyway, but in my long time on the JVM, it&#x27;s always been the gradle and sbt projects that end up with inscrutable and hard-to-follow build scripts.<p>The sbt REPL also regularly breaks existing build scripts by changing how args are passed&#x2F;parsed, or even how terminal color support works, and I just get sad every time I see a new, unexpected error from one of our CI runs.')
