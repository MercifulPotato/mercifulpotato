Or was it part of a migration route driven by repeating cycles of drought and rain? (the fact that they are under many, many layers of sedimentary rock suggests the latter)<p>Similarly, were hominids living in that cave a plan A, plan B, or plan C? Plan B could be a &quot;Helm&#x27;s Deep&quot; situation, where you go there when something goes wrong. While Plan C could be an &#x27;any port in a storm&#x27; situation where unexpected weather caught you in an area you did not mean to stay.<p>Plan A might have been a biologically active region where life devours anything that stops moving for too long, the same way we have trouble finding evidence of these huge cultures in Central and South America.')
