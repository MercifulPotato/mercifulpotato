You know what else is common to those other two cases? They were rushed (pandemrix wasn&#x27;t AFAIK).<p>SARS-Cov-2 vaccines were all rushed, and the safety protocols used to confidently ascertain those billions of vaccines were NOT followed - The standard is to wait 2-4 <i>years</i> to see that there&#x27;s no ADE or other issues.<p>I am pro-vaccination. I don&#x27;t understand why it is hard to acknowledge and discuss the risk profile of vaccines - they re not risk free. Excuse me if I don&#x27;t automatically think a rushed vaccine is perfectly safe.')
