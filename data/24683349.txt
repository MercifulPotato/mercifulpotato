In practical terms, I&#x27;m in favour of freedom of speech.<p>&gt; Pretending that the exceptions which do not relate to political speech are relevant or even interesting is almost in bad faith, however.<p>My point was more to get accross the idea that there are political theories of free speech (actually implemented or not) which (1) have what is called a &quot;free speech principle&quot;, that is, an explicit endorsement and guarantee, to some or any extent, of the right to speak freely (2) enshrine this principle into a law, or suggest that it should be enshrined.<p>&gt;Things which you cannot say which are non-political are curiosities, things for lawyers to get excited about.<p>They&#x27;re also interesting in philosophical thought experiments and determining the value and extents of free speech - most imporantly in the idea of consistency. If threatening letters are disallowed, for instance, what implications does this have, speaking in terms of principles, for more &quot;interesting&quot; sorts of speech? It may have no implications (according to one theory of justification) but it may have far-reaching implications for another.<p>&gt;But &quot;hate speech&quot;, which you offhandedly list among other largely irrelevant forms of expression, should most certainly be covered by any serious definition of free speech.<p>My point in listing the exceptions was to say that <i>if</i> there is some exception, any exception, it means the rule is not absolute, and caveats can be made under certain circumstances. For example, incitement to immediate and direct violence is often an &quot;uninteresting&quot; exception. This is because violence is a kind of harm. However, the law also recognizes various other forms of harm (such as psychological harms). Which harms should or shouldn&#x27;t be included, and why?<p>The question that 1A scholars and political philosophers have tried to answer is what, precisely, the exceptions should be, what the existing exceptions may allow scope for (copyright infringement? child pornography? cyberbullying? obscenity? defamation? - by no means uninteresting), and in general, whether we should have a fundamental law to guarantee freedom of speech at all. I think they&#x27;re valid questions, and I think that too often we take ideas such as free speech allowing hate speech (however those two things are defined[0]), or free speech being worth the cost of hate speech, for granted.<p>[0] To paraphrase Susan Brison, these are hard to define. That&#x27;s okay, we can talk about it. We don&#x27;t have to write the law before we can discuss whether there could be alaw.')
