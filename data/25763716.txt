It took me far too long to realize the following:<p>Freedom of speech does not mean that individuals and private groups have to tolerate asshats. It&#x27;s a fallacy that many, many, far too many, progressive groups and movements fall into: this feeling that we &quot;owe&quot; people to hear them out. And that we &quot;owe&quot; people to let them sit at the same table with us.<p>You are not the government or a hegemonic group&#x2F;platform. You don&#x27;t owe toxic people anything. Ban them, without remorse. Have a rule for it - obviously - but for the most toxic behaviors don&#x27;t even give them a warning. What do you have to lose - a few asshats out of hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of users?<p>And no, it&#x27;s not censorship. Not everything is censorship. Telling idiots and asshats to STFU or GTFO isn&#x27;t censorship. And a lot, and I do mean A LOT of problems that online communities and even real world politics have is connected to just not telling people the simple word of &quot;NO&quot;.')
