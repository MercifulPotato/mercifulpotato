Anytime a Lobbyist is partially financing a congress person&#x27;s election, they get to &quot;participate&quot; in that congress person&#x27;s legislation within the Lobbyist&#x27;s area of specialization. I wager there are Lobbyists for the commercial voting systems, and that is what prevents an open source alternative from even being considered.')
