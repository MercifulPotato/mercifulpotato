One claim raised by the prosecution is that Assange was sent hashes and ran them against a rainbow table in an attempt to provide assistance to manning in order to grant further access to confidential government systems.<p>If this claim is true or not, we don&#x27;t know because it hasn&#x27;t gone to court yet, but the accusation is more than &quot;just protecting a source&quot;.<p>And personally I think there <i>should</i> be an exception to releasing documents that show government wrongdoing which means it isn&#x27;t illegal - however this is not codified in law.')
