If it was me, I&#x27;d be looking for a role in another team or company that has a more realistic approach to on-call.<p>Any potential extra impact on your current colleagues that you leaving might cause is the responsibility of your management and up to them to mitigate. How your current colleagues decide to react to the on-call situation should be up to them.<p>Good luck resolving this, I&#x27;ve been in work situations that had unreasonable expectations myself and I appreciate how stressful it can be.')
