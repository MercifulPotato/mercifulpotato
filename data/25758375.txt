I also use input methods for cuneiform. For a more modern example of this kind of thing, look at CJK input methods.<p>&gt; impracticality of using pictures to represent verbs, adjectives, etc., anything but nouns with visual manifestations. (not that people don&#x27;t try)<p>If you represent your language in pictures rather than try to make a special picture language, it is not that difficult.<p>&gt; no past tense, no future tense<p>This is a feature of languages, not anything to do with the script.
