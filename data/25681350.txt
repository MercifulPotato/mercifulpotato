The spirit of the book is delegation of things you don&#x27;t want to do. Tim writes in the book that before an 80&#x2F;20 analysis you will have to try a lot of things and see what sticks. Considering the fact that Tim writes about proactively researching the market and creating new categories if possible and to test various marketing tools and product ideas it&#x27;s not the four hour work week mindset that&#x27;s the problem. It&#x27;s the people who just read the title and not the book that are hurting its big ideas.')
