There are numerous cases where cash-only medical clinics are able to offer up-front pricing for a fraction of what is billed to medical insurance companies.  If Cuban&#x27;s idea is &quot;we don&#x27;t do insurance but you&#x27;re free to pay with an HSA card or seek reimbursement from your insurance company&quot; then this could be a huge winner.')
