In NZ it&#x27;s quite similar and very strict; if any trace of antibiotic is detected in a batch of milk it is rejected, and the offending farmer must pay for it (easily $1,000s, probably much more).<p>Aside from the resistance issue, one reason for this is quite simple; antibiotics in the milk mean you can&#x27;t make cheese with it. If a cow needs antibiotics, they are separated from the herd  for a few days until they are clear (and also can&#x27;t be slaughtered for meat for a longer period of time).')
