(I&#x27;m one.) Every musician I know has transcribed solos. You pick some solo you like but have no idea what they&#x27;re doing, transcribe it, and learn to play it along with them. Bits and pieces perhaps will rub off in your own playing. You don&#x27;t want to sound like them, but it&#x27;s good to be able to if you want â€“ and for that you need to absorb their style, so your body can just go into that mode, without having to think about it. I&#x27;m a piano player but have also transcribed sax, trumpet, bass lines, gospel songs, reggae, funk, .. even taps dripping, babies crying etc etc.')
