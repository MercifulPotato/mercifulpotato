Briefly, the proof relies on the fact that human utility functions are hidden, and that the only way to extract information about them is to observe voluntary trade between humans.  These trades in aggregate create prices which guide the economic planning by independent producers.  The very fact of imposing central plans on people (who are no longer able to engage in voluntary trade) effectively destroys the input information about what people want or need and how much they value goods.  After this information is destroyed, no matter how fancy the computers and planning algorithms are, they cannot possibly produce any meaningful plans. Garbage in - garbage out.')
