There may be some points where LXD is &quot;better&quot; (they keep bringing up uid&#x2F;gid mapping) but it really does not provide the same functionality as OCI containers and does not enable the same workflows as OCI containers.<p>LXD is not an alternative to Docker or K8S, it is something different which offers different features.<p>And if we are just talking docker, and not k8s, then all the security you can ever want can be found in podman which by default operates rootless and daemonless and works on stock standard OCI containers.<p>If we are talking k8s there are already runtimes which support rootless operation like cri-o and there are k8s distros that support rootless operation <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rootless-containers&#x2F;usernetes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rootless-containers&#x2F;usernetes</a> - these maybe are not as widely used as they should be and work is ongoing but you will soon see more of them I think.')
