When these become common, it will likely cause another seismic shift in the pure-camera market. Perhaps some of them will actually be bonded with the sensors, unlike what we have today.<p>Regardless, new lens technology -- while likely to make a greater impact on mobile phones -- is largely orthogonal to them.')
