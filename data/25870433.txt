No, wait.<p>Inefficient bureaucracy is a political choice and a policy outcome. It doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be that way, and it does require effort to make it otherwise, but it has to be politicized in a way that points towards more efficiency. GOV.UK have been fairly good at this, despite some of the other dysfunctionalities of the British state. I&#x27;ve never quite understood all the US complaints about &quot;the DMV&quot;, given that I&#x27;ve always been able to interact with the British equivalent (DVLA) over post or website.<p>Where the politics turns into a fight between &quot;use government to achieve public policy goals&quot; versus &quot;destroy government, except for the police and security forces&quot;, the &quot;destroy government&quot; faction get to make the actual governance worse and have forfeited any ability to make useful or constructive criticism.<p>(anyway, this is all off topic for the Monarch butterfly, who operate a constitutional monarchy rather than a Weberian state)')
