If they say they have 20 years of experience in X and you hire them, you&#x27;ll know very quickly if that was a lie. Those tests are so insulting to the relationship you&#x27;re pretending to want to build. Why would I bother putting false information on my resume that has the potential to get me hired and get tested daily? Isn&#x27;t that why there&#x27;s a probation period?!<p>I have 20 years of experience in X but prove it? Why&#x27;s the burden on me to prove what I&#x27;ve already told you? Are you saying I&#x27;m a liar? If my date of birth is on my cv do you expect a birth certificate to validate that information too?<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s always been my philosophy - hire on facts and fit, fire quickly if anything was wrong - and it&#x27;s been pretty smooth. The great thing that it does is it prevents testing for futile thing that you will never use in your position and that are just elitist criteria or vanity wishes.')
