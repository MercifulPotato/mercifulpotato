There is inherent sexism in our vocabulary.<p>Yes there absolutely is. That doesn’t mean we should knee jerk react to things without any actual understanding of them. Over time, words like mankind will be used less and less and become more anachronistic as our language evolves. But that is not the same as them being, in actuality, sexist and definitely doesn’t warrant sarcastic comments about there being no women on board due to the word being used.<p>&gt; The word &quot;man&quot; did uniquely mean &quot;human&quot; in the old English (and the words wæpman and wifman meant male human and female human, respectively), but it doesn&#x27;t anymore.<p>But they both do. “Wer” survives in werewolf and wif survives in Wife. Just because the originals did not survive, it doesn’t mean that all words derived from them didn’t as well. Mann did not survive, but it doesn&#x27;t mean all words derived from it didn&#x27;t as well.<p>I choose not to use words like mankind and manned in my writing and they already feel a bit anachronistic, but it just strikes me as petty to try and “call out” other people for using words that are perfectly acceptable.')
