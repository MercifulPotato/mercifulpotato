This excludes China for obvious reason, at an estimate of <i>$10B</i> pure raw profit. And this consistent income is <i>the</i> foundation of its whole Services Strategy.<p>Every two years these article pops up, going back as far as 2010 if I remember correctly. And I am now reasonably confidence it is one of those Apple tactics &#x2F; submarine articles [1] in renewing contract with Google. Just like they did with Intel Modem, Qualcomm Modem, and Broadcom WiFi. ( Every two years Broadcom threaten to sell their RF &#x2F; WiFi unit [2] to retaliate ) And of course if you dont you end up like IMG PowerVR or Dialog Semiconductor.<p>I mean I cant be the only one who notice this. It is getting old, repetitive and boring.<p>There is very little incentive for Apple to give up the $10B raw profit. They will continue to push Siri Search and Siri Suggestions with their own search engine while leaving the less lucrative search to Google. And in the name of privacy sending very little Data to Google. Basically Squeezing Google from all corners. So Google are now paying more for default placement, and getting less revenue per Ads.
