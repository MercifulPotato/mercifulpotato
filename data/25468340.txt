But the point is that even a high percentage may not be sufficient; a 90% reduction only improves the situation by 10 dB; a 99% reduction is an improvement of only 20 dB.  As the sibling post illustrates, today&#x27;s receivers are very, very sensitive; cell phones, I believe, have sensitivities below -80 dBm.')
