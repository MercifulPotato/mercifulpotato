Item(by='emn13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605436515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096541, text='That&#x27;s simply not true; including in the US. Libel statutes make distinctions between true and false statements, and between knowingly misleading statements and honest mistakes.  Do you think truth <i>should</i> be irrelevant?  I don&#x27;t think society is stable under those conditions, but certainly that&#x27;s not the law now.<p>There&#x27;s no meaningful slippery slope here either; because the vast majority of cases don&#x27;t involve anything questionably true, they clearly involve statements that have evidence or do not, and where there&#x27;s doubt, the protections are generally fairly solid (this is in the news often enough too; witness how Musk&#x27;s knowingly false and clearly negative &quot;pedo guy&quot; comment was still not ruled defamation).<p>What&#x27;s worse is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to win a defamation lawsuit to punish someone if you&#x27;re much wealthier than the defendant, because too many jurisdictions let each side pay their own legal costs - such that those wanting to stifle dissent can often simply threaten legal action, even knowing full well they&#x27;d lose.  The point doesn&#x27;t need to be to win, the point can simply be to impose costs that are felt unevenly.')
