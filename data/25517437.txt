Sometimes the noise is music(as in the popular &quot;lofi hiphop study beats&quot; or old anime soundtracks, or 80&#x27;s pop hits) and sometimes the noise is man talks into camera(as in tech reviewers, music theory teachers, and video essayists) but it&#x27;s basically inoffensive, interchangable background with an occasional moment that makes me pay attention or even comment.<p>By their metrics it probably looks great: lots of watch time! Interaction! But it&#x27;s basically leaving the possibilities unfulfilled.<p>Now, I remember early days YT as well. It was much better at getting you circulating through a niche, but it did have the problem of getting stuck in a cycle of the same few videos. Modern YT just gradually moves you towards popular categories. Occasionally it does surprise, as with the months where &quot;Steamed Hams&quot; edits were recommended daily, or more recently, the train station ghost story song with no title. But that&#x27;s mostly the exception.<p>Edit: And a big part of why I seem to have this feed is simply because I have &quot;liked and subscribed&quot; to channels in these categories. If you do that, the recommender biases heavily back towards them.')
