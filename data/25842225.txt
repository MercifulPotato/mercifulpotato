They may tell you they don&#x27;t believe but what&#x27;s not necessarily what they really think.<p>&#x27;They&#x27;re just an idiot&#x27; is lazy analysis and dangerous. Very few people are idiots. Most people are lucid. It&#x27;s dangerous because you&#x27;re giving yourself a reason to be less cautious (how dangerous can they be - they&#x27;re idiots, right?) rather than thinking these people aren&#x27;t playing by the rules I&#x27;m playing by, what should I do about that?<p>Whenever you think someone’s an idiot stop and think if it’s their modus operandi to make you think that.')
