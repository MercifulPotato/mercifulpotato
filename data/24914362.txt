The reality is that the entire field started to hit limitations imposed by physics on the current silicon trajectory. While transistors kept (and keep) getting smaller, it&#x27;s diminishing returns squeezing clockspeed and single-core performance out of it. Instead, everything has been going into scaling horizontally with more cores and more cache.')
