People want simple, free image hosts. So, the demand is always there. And every new simple, free image host eventually has to make money, so it becomes an ad-ridden mess. Imgur was once super simple and became the de-facto image host for Reddit overnight. It&#x27;s competition back then was Imagebucket and the like. Now, it IS Imagebucket. And so we have a new challenger. (Well, Reddit has it&#x27;s own image hosting - sometimes! It&#x27;s limited to some clients and some subreddits, at the discretion of the mods I believe.)')
