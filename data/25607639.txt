So if your furnace fails while in the contract it is repaired&#x2F;replaced free or at a pro rated price?<p>If so, I could see people liking it as it serves the same function as an HOA: a hedge against bad things happening.<p>Water heater died? Plumber comes out, no charge. Neighbor starting a junkyard on his front lawn? HOA sends a letter, no confrontation.<p>Some people will decline an HOA for the same reasons they decline extended warranties: they’d rather deal with situations themselves, as they arise. Others don’t want to be bothered and let someone else handle it. I think there is space for both.')
