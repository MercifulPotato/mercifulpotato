The fundamental idea is very cheap computational nodes  that only interact by passing messages around, with the idea that a recursive design inspired by cells and biology, will &gt;be much more successful than traditional programming where you try to separate data structures from the procedures that operate on them. If your microservice has setters and getters, you&#x27;re missing the point of this original vision of OOP. You could certainly build a system with 40,000 of these live, but probably you would not have 40,000 different chunks of source code behind them.<p>Lovely description of the actor model in erlang&#x2F;elixir and akka :)')
