A lot of hard work has gone into getting M3 to 1.0, so this represents a major milestone. In getting to this point, we&#x27;ve focused quite a bit on stability and resilency, performance improvements (most notably during bootstrapping), and ease of configuration. All of these changes are aimed at ensuring M3 provides you the bulletproof, high performance experience one would expect of a production grade metrics engine. For more information on what went into the release, take a look at the changelog (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;m3db&#x2F;m3&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v1.0.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;m3db&#x2F;m3&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v1.0.0</a>).<p>Thank you to the open source community and everyone who has been involved in getting M3 to 1.0! We&#x27;re very excited for M3&#x27;s future!')
