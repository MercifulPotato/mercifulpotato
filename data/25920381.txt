Advertisements existed before you and I were both alive and they will exist when we&#x27;re gone.<p>But that does not mean I have to partake in them, watch them, or allow them to consume my attention and time. I also don&#x27;t need to spend my limited time on this planet trying to &quot;fix advertising&quot;. I can simply block them and ignore the ones that slip through, and get on with my life. If this is an issue that is dear to your heart, that sentiment undoubtedly feels dismissive. I&#x27;m sorry about that.')
