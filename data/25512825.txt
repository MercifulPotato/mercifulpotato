Either word of mouth or through the phone book.<p>Word of mouth is good because it encourages businesses to provide the best service &amp; value as that will directly affect whether they get referrals or not.<p>Phone book is also good because although it&#x27;s similar to advertising, it&#x27;s advertising that benefits both sides. The customer is in the market for a service and looks at ads from businesses that are looking for customers, unlike now where ads are pushed at you even when you don&#x27;t actually need anything and distract you from whatever task you were doing.<p>There&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t have a modern version of the &quot;phone book&quot; where businesses can publish ads for a nominal fee (to pay for a background check to ensure they&#x27;re legitimate) and prospective customers can then search through it.')
