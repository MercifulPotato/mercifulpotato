This looks much more like Greenwald trying to capitalize on hype. The entire spectrum of details around the Biden emails has been roundly debunked and there is tons of evidence to suggest itâ€™s illegitimately sourced by agents directly directed by Trump, from sources with active incentives to try to damage Biden.<p>It is <i>responsible</i> to decline to run this story.
