Once a user pointed this out to me, the next release fixed the underlying issue in a better way. After years in which the Debian folks didn&#x27;t file an issue or report the problem in any way that I could tell.<p>Mind you, Debian is not alone in this, it happens with other distros, too.<p>And to be fair, I think this rather depends a lot on the downstream package maintainer; I&#x27;ve witnessed this with other projects where they were quite good in interacting with upstream to get something sorted out. I am not really sure if any policy Debian&#x2F;Fedora&#x2F;... could enact would really help with it; people can (accidentally or intentionally) ignore them.')
