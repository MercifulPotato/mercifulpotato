This is something.   Therefore, this must be done.&quot; is a well-known logical fallacy.<p>Introducing non-native species can have unexpected consequences.   Though lynxes do prey on deer, they also prey on birds and smaller mammals, which would put them in competition with Scottish wildcats, which are endangered.   We can&#x27;t be sure that introducing lynxes won&#x27;t drive Scottish wildcats to extinction.<p>There are other solutions to the problem you mention.   Deer can be shot and the venison sold in supermarkets and other outlets (restaurants, once COVID-19 is under control).   This already happens, albeit on a small scale.  Venison could also be exported but there&#x27;s now a lot of extra paperwork which needs to be done now that we&#x27;ve left the EU.')
