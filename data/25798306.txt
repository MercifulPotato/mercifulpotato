It&#x27;s straightforward if you want to deploy using nix&#x2F;NixOS, but you can also adapt it to create portable deployables. E.g. I cross-compile a mips kernel, initramfs, and small userspace to run on a system without nix.<p>If you think your app will be ABI compatible, it may be enough to cross-compile it with nix in an ordinary way and remove the RUNPATH and dynamic linker it sets in the elf file.')
