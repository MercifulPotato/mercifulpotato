Because the hospitals retain this data I was collect all of the medical records from her experience and am currently seeking a subject matter expert to review them (very difficult to find it turns out).  If I had requested that this data be purged without having a complete copy then obviously the information is not going to contribute to any follow-up investigation.<p>There are very real and concerning issues with ongoing custody of this type of data by any organization, let alone any of the access that is provided to it through relationships that we as consumers are unaware of.  But I don&#x27;t think the answer is wholesale elimination of custody, there&#x27;s a lot of pros and cons that everyone should be in a position to understand and decide for themselves.')
