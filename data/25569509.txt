I&#x27;ve learnt almost everything I can do reasonably well by &quot;sitting down and doing it&quot;.\nThe same goes for making music, sitting down, hitting keys, and bit by bit, some simpleton version of FÃ¼r Elise comes out, then looking at the sheet music, seeing a link between the sounds I&#x27;m making and the symbols.. Seeing that there are symbols that don&#x27;t fit with what I&#x27;m playing, trying to hit more notes, find out that those in between is why my version sounds simple, learning to hear those new notes, and just iterate endlessly.')
