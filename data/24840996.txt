I intend it as constructive criticism.<p>I&#x27;ve been a FOSS user and sometimes contributor since 1994 when I installed Linux with floppy disks, and have consistently watched FOSS lose the mainstream because they don&#x27;t grasp the critical importance of UI&#x2F;UX.<p>I want to write &quot;it has to just work&quot; on a sledgehammer and bash people about the head with it over and over again until they understand that user experience is f&#x27;ing EVERYTHING and every installation or setup step required to adopt something roughly halves adoption.<p>This is largely because we are in an age of time and attention poverty.')
