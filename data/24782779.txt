I think.<p>There is something there fighting to come out - something about software literacy (I claim we all will read write software like we read write language).<p>There are two types of &quot;publish&quot; - the kind I do here and on social media that is not proofread just flung out.  It includes emails to friends and texts with shopping lists - and it is easy and simple and enabled by the platform<p>and there is publishing - a book an article etc.  It has hurdles (and higher expectations)<p>Most times writing software feels like the latter - QA and proofreading, tests and slow release cycles.<p>Actually getting my thoughts down takes time - it takes reading around and consideration and hell it has friction.<p>So yes we need faster ways for people to deploy software and sandbox it so the blast radius is is limited - ensure my code to switch the lights on might leave my hall light blazing for a weeks holiday but is not going to turn the microwave on or reset the fire alarm.<p>But the code to do that must be the higher quality, the professional tier.<p>It is crazy to expect JK Rowling to go through the same process to send a tweet as to publish a book, but it is also crazy to hold that tweet to the same standards. And frankly it&#x27;s crazy for the tweet to get the same kind of audience. (no this is not a comment about the content of any of her tweets - just an example after buying books for daughter)<p>Same goes for software.  Different release standards different quality standards different sandboxes.')
