Melbourne is the only large&#x2F;dense city in Australia that has quite cool winters, similar to the weather that prevailed in Northern Asia, Europe and the US in Feb-April, and that is returning to Western Europe now. As we now know, given the serious outbreaks that have happened in warmer regions, warm weather is not a strong enough factor to halt this virus altogether, but it does seem to have an influence, and it&#x27;s striking to note the progression of this virus in Melbourne, relative to the weather.<p>AMA!')
