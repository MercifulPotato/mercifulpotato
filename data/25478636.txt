I&#x27;d be happier with something like 10 years, and paying exponentially increasing fees to renew it past that mark in exchange for keeping culture locked up.<p>The exponentially increasing cost works well. Start off at a $10 registration for ten years, then multiply by 10 for each subsequent ten year registration. You want to renew that 120 year old copyright on an individual work? No problem, that&#x27;ll be ten trillion dollars for the next ten years, see you in ten years when it&#x27;s a hundred trillion.<p>Meanwhile 90% of everything enters the public domain inside of twenty years because it&#x27;s not worth paying a thousand bucks for another ten.<p>&gt; Trademarks? That&#x27;s a consumer protection service and for a small percent of profits on marked items plus a flat fee should be allowed.<p>Trademarks are fine the way they are. Nobody is complaining about the term of trademarks, which is as long as you&#x27;re actually using it.<p>It would actually be better if copyright required that -- so that if you want to retain a copyright it can&#x27;t be out of print for more than ten years.')
