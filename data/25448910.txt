For example some vectorised (in sense A = G<i>(BX + C</i>D) for matrices and vectors) it allocates temporary matrices whreas matlab is great at optimising such stuff. Most things could (and for optimal performance should) be written with loops and that will be much faster in Julia. However, there is Julia package Tullio.jl and it’s great with matrices&#x2F;vectors&#x2F;tensor stuff. It fuses operations, uses AVX instructions and creates code for GPU if asked.')
