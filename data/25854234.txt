Apple engineered that page to read to people who are scanning quickly that &quot;it&#x27;s encrypted, it&#x27;s fine&quot; when in fact iCloud Backup, which includes complete plaintext message history (and SMS history too, which Apple normally would not see, plus all iMessage&#x2F;SMS attachments like photos and videos) is NOT end to end encrypted but encrypted with Apple keys, and can be decrypted by Apple at any time without the user&#x27;s device or password.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps the most shady thing they do. Nothing on that page is a lie, yet if you read it without an intimate knowledge of Apple&#x27;s services (&quot;iCloud&quot;, vs &quot;Messages in iCloud&quot;, vs &quot;iCloud Backup&quot;) you will get an impression of the opposite of what is true.<p>Additionally, they were going to e2e encrypt backups, but the FBI asked them not to, and so they didn&#x27;t, and Apple and the FBI can read every message in every backup without a warrant.')
