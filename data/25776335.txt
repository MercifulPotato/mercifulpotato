For example, Lbry&#x2F;Odysee and ilk are often touted as alternatives. I watched a video from someone pretty big on that platform where they had shifted to say maybe Linux Gaming isn&#x27;t doing too well long term. He&#x27;s being &quot;cancelled&quot; right now over there because of the current audience of these platforms. He was already dealing with tons of &quot;why are you still posting on youtube as well&quot; comments. I find a lot of people seem to use these alternatives not so much for their superiority, but because they hate big tech.<p>I guess ultimately his videos are still there, and that&#x27;s the real point of decentralization. But perhaps the main issue isn&#x27;t so much about using Youtube&#x2F;Twitter, but <i>exclusively</i> using them. I can understand &quot;going where the people are&quot; to bring a message, but don&#x27;t <i>only</i> post there.')
