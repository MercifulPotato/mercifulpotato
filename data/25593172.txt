With variable production, there will always be time where you have more energy produced than you need. Why not use the excess to create hydrogen and store it? Now the energy doesn&#x27;t go to waste.<p>Consider nuclear power. Nuclear doesn&#x27;t scale down well- it&#x27;s most efficient at a specific rate of production. But demand is quite variable- 2am on a not-so-warm-or-cold day, who needs all that extra energy? Why not use the excess to create hydrogen and store it? Now the energy doesn&#x27;t go to waste.<p>In short, the energy used to create hydrogen can be very low, provided you have a cheap means to store and move it to where it needs to be, and provided you can deal with variable production rates.<p>If this provides an income for the energy producer, then it becomes more financially viable to use wind, solar, and nuclear- all non-CO2 emitters.')
