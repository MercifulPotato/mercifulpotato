For instance, in the classic case of de Havilland Comets brought down by square windows, I think it was an honest mistake that happened because pressurized cabins were new-ish tech. They worked to understand the problem and fixed the design. Nobody was trying to cut corners AFAIK (no pun intended).<p>I guess we could make another category where an iffy design is made to fail by corner-cutting on the part of the airlines, as in the MD-80 pitch trim jackscrew issues.<p>The MAX is a case of the actual aircraft manufacturer explicitly compromising the design of a safety feature because they knew it would help them sell more planes (due to avoiding training&#x2F;recertification requirements). IIRC, the investigation revealed a consistent pattern of negligence and outright malfeasance on Boeing&#x27;s part to this effect. I wouldn&#x27;t say this kind of thing has never happened before, but off the top of my head I have to assume it&#x27;s pretty rare.')
