The media isn&#x27;t doing this. The US government is <i>definitely</i> not doing this (not sure where you are). And you were probably exaggerating when you said bubonic plague, but the death rate is like 10-15% for that. The media is definitely <i>not</i> saying that it&#x27;s even close to that at a population level.<p>If you actually listen to the media, they all say that all of the precautions are mostly for those in vulnerable populations. In fact, the entire reason we wear masks is because covid is <i>so</i> mild in healthy people that you might not know when you get it, and then you&#x27;ll spread it.')
