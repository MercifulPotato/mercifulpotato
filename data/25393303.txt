People are dead just as much irrespective whether they died on 9&#x2F;11 or because of Covid or because of, let&#x27;s say, a traffic accident. Family and friends will miss them just as much.<p>To me giving a different weight to different causes of death is what seems the more emotional response. If your feelings are influenced by that context for why we care, that is emotional. There&#x27;s nothing inherent in the distinction between those circumstances that should influence how much we care.')
