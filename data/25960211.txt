FDA approval is treated as a &quot;gold standard&quot; yet we have lots of evidence that it isn&#x27;t. Companies lie, make non-intentional mistakes not caught by the FDA, there&#x27;s all sorts of issues with it. The FDA review process is more like an editor checking spelling than actual rigorous analysis.<p>I don&#x27;t think your media analogy is accurate. It would be like the government censoring media companies, but having a poor biased criteria which then changes later, but is also subject to lies, etc. I don&#x27;t think its a good analogy.<p>I think drug companies should be rated on their data openness, with enough information to reproduce results. I think approval processes should be replaced with levels of confidence certifications. For example:<p>Gold is independent labs find similar results to internal labs (verified)\nSilver is only internal labs produced results, not reproduced elsewhere\netc.')
