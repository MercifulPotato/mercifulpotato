The film company would be using my labor as well as the director&#x27;s, in conjunction with all the capital they own (cameras, sets...) to generate a profit.<p>&gt; they could really move your body around and position it in poses to take photographs.<p>Labor.<p>&gt; I think your distinction of &quot;capital&quot; and &quot;labor&quot; is fake and completely useless<p>Ok.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;mine&quot; though, these are centuries old analytical concepts.<p>&gt; unclear why you insist on it.<p>I insist on it because it&#x27;s a sensible and already established way to talk about this stuff.<p>You guys are the ones making the weird nominal excursion by asserting that labor and capital are identical because you read in a Tim Ferris startup manual that &quot;every man is his own capitalist!&quot; or something.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a radical to just use these terms in their original way.
