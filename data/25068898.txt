Then one day I couldn&#x27;t see any of my saved locations. What? I did some research and found out that a recent update now requires you to enable location history. WTF! Their brain damaged logic is the location you saved was done in the past so it stands to reason that it&#x27;s part of history! Of course that&#x27;s not really the reason, the reason is to force people to turn location history back on.<p>Bullet, meet foot.')
