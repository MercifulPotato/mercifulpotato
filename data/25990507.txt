There are two fields where I mainly act: (1) DevOps; from database administration and data modeling to back-end programming or front-end design all the way to orchestrated deployment with latest tech and (2) Standalone software; involves embedded development in restrict environments, blockchain applications mostly related to Parity&#x27;s Substrate and plain command-line interfaces.<p>On the open-source side of things, I regularly contribute to several projects, helping and communicating with other developers. Take a look at the available coding portfolio in my GitHub profile at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c410-f3r" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;c410-f3r</a> where my public collaborations in the last fours years are more focused on the Rust Programming Language ecosystem.<p>Over 40 certified courses have been completed and eight professional certifications that covers a wide range of area were obtained from different organizations, e.g., Google (Cloud) and the Blockchain Training Alliance. Learning is very important to keep up with both old and new technologies, my newest certification is the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) and more certifications will be earned over time.<p>To finish, IT in general is like a living organism that is constantly changing, that is why I am always looking forward for a new challenge to increase knowledge. For example, my proudest project is a constrained NP-problem solver compiled to WASM (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c410-f3r.github.io&#x2F;mop-playground" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c410-f3r.github.io&#x2F;mop-playground</a>) where I spent years reading scientific articles to write efficient data-structures and algorithms.')
