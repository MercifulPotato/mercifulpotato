An interesting point to note about their pricing plans and policies in general - is that they&#x27;re &quot;flexible&quot;.<p>Foe example there&#x27;s a 200 email per day &quot;limit&quot; on the cheapest plan, but each plan comes with a 25% tolerance.<p>Similarly the storage &quot;quota&quot; on each tier.<p>I just asked Migadu&#x27;s support about whether there was a 10GB option available, as 5GB was too small for mea and 30GB too high &#x2F; costly.  &quot;Sure,&quot; he replied in under 4 minutes - &quot;there&#x27;s actually no fixed storage limit on each plan, please see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.migadu.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;#how-do-storage-limits-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.migadu.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;#how-do-storage-limits-work</a>&quot;  And sure enough - 5GB, 10GB, 15GB...  all would be possible on the &quot;5GB tier&quot;.<p>If you get close to or exceed the 30GB quota of the next tier up, their systems contact you and suggest upgradng which sounds pretty reasonable.<p>I&#x27;m just going to check if Apple or Google are quite so accomodating...')
