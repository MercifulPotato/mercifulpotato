Item(by='magicalhippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608307070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468166, text='I&#x27;m no expert, but AFAIK one thing is secure communication, in the sense that the recipient can detect if anyone is eavesdropping.<p>As I&#x27;ve understood it, to &quot;listen in&quot; the eavesdropper has to destroy the entangled state by measuring it, and there&#x27;s no way to perfectly clone the entangled state before doing that.<p>The recipient can compare the entangled data with the measurement results (sent via classical means) and detect statistical inconsistencies if there is an eavesdropper.<p>edit: I see their page[1] mentions quantum metrology, which I found reference to in a page[2] describing work to improve GPS and similar detection using quantum entanglement. Not sure if it&#x27;s directly related but seems like there should be room for some interesting work using this quantum network in this area.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieqnet.fnal.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieqnet.fnal.gov&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.engineering.arizona.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;quantum-entanglement-offers-unprecedented-precision-gps-imaging-and-beyond" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.engineering.arizona.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;quantum-entangleme...</a>')
