You won&#x27;t be able to use the Supercharger stations which I took as the main focus of TFA. I&#x27;m also wondering if this would work for any stations which would be selling power, it seems these are only basic systems without any billing. So mostly only those &quot;patrons only&quot; kind of stations.<p>Ultimately buying Tesla is supporting vendor lock-in and proprietary connectors instead of industry standards. And what a joke, as if Tesla bothered to even offer such a thing to allow the other automakers to use their connector and signaling.')
