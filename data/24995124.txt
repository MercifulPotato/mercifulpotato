It seemed they just relied on the supplied IP address in the XML payload to verify that a device was authorised to use the gateway.<p>A small proof of concept showed that it was exploitable, e.g. a small script proved a bank card would be processed successfully without needing to actually be on an authorised network or go through any kind of session handshake - we didn&#x27;t try any of the other functions like requesting refunds or cancelling payments but figured the bank would like to know they had a big glaring hole in their security.<p>After finally getting through their merry-go-round of customer &quot;support&quot; to someone in their IT&#x2F;Security team, the initial cordial emails stopped and we received a threatening letter from their legal department blathering about legal repercussions of cyber crime and fraud etc. They also contacted the client and threatened to shut down their accounts and merchant facilities for our transgressions.<p>Anyway, definitely makes me think twice about reporting any public-facing security issues directly to a company, I don&#x27;t have the resources or willpower to fight a major corporation if they decide to swing that way, that&#x27;s for sure.')
