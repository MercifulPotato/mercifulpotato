We have a protocol meant to replace IPv4 and eliminate several kludges (NAT) in the process. But guess what? People would rather keep on hacking the previous protocol to the extremes than learn and implement a newer better system. IPv6 is better than IPv4 in literally every sense, but your sysadmin can&#x27;t be bothered to deviate even slightly from her decade old knowledge.<p>So now we have all sorts of v4 in v6 tunneling, someone even talked about NAT for IPv6 (WTF?!). The end result is that v6 is incredibly complex due to these backward stuff.<p>We need Apple to deprecate IPv4 like they did 32 bit. Otherwise companies will keep us locked into old technology for eternity.')
