In school I once read somewhere that if you knew you had a computation to do that was 100 MFLOPS (or whatever seemed like a large number at the time), and you had to complete it sometime in the next 18 months, a solid strategy is to wait 9 months and buy more-modern hardware.<p>You&#x27;d end up with more &#x27;residual&#x27; computing power (when your computation is done, you have the hardware lying around, and now it&#x27;s more powerful than if you had bought on day 0), and it would probably cost less in energy as well.')
