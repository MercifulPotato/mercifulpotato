Could you imagine trying to test a 40 hour game?<p>Sony and MS&#x27;s teams aren&#x27;t QA. Neither are Apple&#x27;s. Apple&#x27;s team looks for the standard stuff like are they using IAPs properly? Is there anything deceiving happening here? etc.<p>By the sounds of things Sony and MS&#x27;s review teams did find that Cypberpunk 2077 was NOT in a good spot. But they took CDPR&#x27;s word that they would fix it before launch (the typical day 1 patch situation). And that bombed hard.<p>I think your expectation on what happens is not in line with reality unfortunately.')
