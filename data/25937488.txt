I might know that a mob acts like a mob, but I&#x27;m certainly not going to be surprised if &quot;my&quot; rights are affected if I&#x27;m part of the group from which the mob manifested. That doesn&#x27;t mean the decision to alter my rights is directed at me, personally.<p>Random speculation about why this was done or who did it, for what reasons, is also a type of mob thinking.')
