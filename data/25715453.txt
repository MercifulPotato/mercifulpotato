In 20 years, when we drive only electric cars, TSLA will be the near-monopolist of that market, similar to Google, Amazon, or Facebook.<p>I don&#x27;t think I really believe that case, but that&#x27;s the way the valuation is justified. It&#x27;s not something that can be captured easily in a discounted cash flow model, because after a couple years you&#x27;re basically just inventing numbers there. But if you knew for sure that TSLA would succeed in dominating the electric car market, you&#x27;d probably buy it at much higher prices than we see today.')
