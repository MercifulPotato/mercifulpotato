Even ignoring the possibility you have a double-bit error that causes a crash, or a triple-bit error that maybe can&#x27;t be detected, frequent ECC errors are problematic. I&#x27;ve encountered machines that consistently ran my software horribly slowly. I don&#x27;t remember specifics, but let&#x27;s say at least 100X latency of other machines for similar operations. When I dug in, I found these machines had a huge amount of correctable memory errors. The correction apparently degrades performance significantly. I&#x27;m not sure exactly why, but I guess there&#x27;s an MCE trap to report the memory error, and perhaps that path is slow.')
