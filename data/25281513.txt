I&#x27;m currently between options because nothing works for me. I was a happy Google Play Music subscriber for years. All they had to to was change the colour scheme and swap the backend and I would have been a happy camper. Now I have canceled my subscription and don&#x27;t know what to use.<p>At the end of the day music isn&#x27;t critical to me, so I don&#x27;t really care if Google dominates it. If I had to switch I&#x27;m not too worried about being locked into something.')
