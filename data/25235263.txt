What drew me in is that you can convert Postman collections to k6 scripts (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;loadimpact&#x2F;postman-to-k6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;loadimpact&#x2F;postman-to-k6</a>) if you already have Postman collections. If you don&#x27;t have any Postman collections, you can just start with k6 and you can have a simple script up and running in under a minute. I&#x27;ve used k6 at work and for personal projects testing Scala, Go, and Python (I guess the language you&#x27;re testing doesn&#x27;t matter b&#x2F;c you&#x27;re just hitting http endpoints). If you&#x27;re doing testing that requires getting an OAuth token, there&#x27;s a flow for that. I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experiences and would heartily recommend k6 if you&#x27;re looking to performance test!')
