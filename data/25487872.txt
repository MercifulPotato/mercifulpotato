There are without a doubt lots of bugs. I have friends who enjoy the game who are still seeing the bugs.<p>It&#x27;s okay if you like something that is still buggy. Don&#x27;t be so insecure that you can&#x27;t enjoy something even with it&#x27;s faults.<p>Just don&#x27;t pretend those faults don&#x27;t exist.')
