I regularly post on HN because these are computer related investigations or things I find interesting. I was hoping it would lead to interesting discussion about how to validate this stuff, or someone to point out I&#x27;m wrong (and thus I could improve my analysis). Don&#x27;t we all want discourse and to improve our understanding of reality.<p>I&#x27;m just the super curious, I have to know the world to make it better. I also love when I hear some confusion I do FOIA requests, pull data and dive in. I don&#x27;t care about the results at the start. Exploring the data helps me make informed decisions.')
