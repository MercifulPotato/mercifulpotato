I wanted to buy a 10k lux light to see whether it improves my winter health.  I spent well over an hour on Amazon going through reviews and products.  When I found something I liked, on several occasions, Fakespot rated the product a C or D and noted it saw tons of reviews being removed and other heuristics.  Then I personally noticed some products from different brands looked almost identical.  And sometimes I noticed the same product from the same brand with separate entries.  Also, when I wanted to read 3 or lower star reviews, I was told there were some, but I&#x27;d click the filter and it&#x27;d find no reviews lower than 4 or 5.<p>The other month I posted a review on Amazon for six canning jars where 5 spontaneously cracked in the fridge by themselves, unmolested.  My review got removed and Amazon said it failed some guideline.  This never used to happen.<p>Look, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more here and there, I rarely look for the cheapest thing or budget item.  But why is lying and deception so commonplace and lackadaisically accepted?  It&#x27;s grating.<p>Someone should invent an Honest Amazon competition.  Honestly, Ebay vendors are often more trustworthy.')
