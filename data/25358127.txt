I would have thought it sorted on family name, not middle name?<p>For example, &quot;Alice Betty Cass&quot; should be sorted as &quot;Cass, Alice Betty&quot;. The example given would sort it as &quot;Betty Cass, Alice&quot;. That would only make sense if the surname was double-barrelled. e.g. Alice Betty-Cass.')
