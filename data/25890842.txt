Physical transport layers run their own protocols and the physical media themselves<p>Whoosh, you missed the point. The “base layer” of the Internet is the one that allows cross-connectivity of the networks. All of the layers beneath tcp&#x2F;ip are interchangeable and people will still be able to get on the Internet.<p>&gt; And while these have been mostly commoditized whoever controls them does have a lot of power.<p>They were immediately commoditized by design when we standardized on IP. IP over MPLS vs IP over ATM vs IP over frame relay looks no different to the end user. In one minute I can roam from a network based on dwdm to one based on microwave back-haul and I still can connect to hackernews and pull down comments over TCP&#x2F;IP.<p>When people want “Internet access”, the vast majority don’t give two shits about the medium, the link layer protocols, or anything like that. They want IP connectivity that has decent speeds. That’s the “base layer” that everything on the Internet is built on. Anything below that is transparently (and frequently) replaced because it’s an irrelevant implementation detail stripped off at the boundary of each network.')
