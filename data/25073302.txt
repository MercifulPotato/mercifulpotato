Plus there&#x27;s the people that think pip&#x2F;venv aren&#x27;t enough, but that tools on top of them plug the gaps (poetry).<p>But I think that the share of professional developers who see it as a solved problem at all is less than 90%. Obviously, we&#x27;ve all got some way of working with&#x2F;around the issues, that doesn&#x27;t mean that we don&#x27;t feel that they exist.')
