Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[24683016], score=None, time=1601843383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681117, text='Now you&#x27;re talking in circles. @seattle_spring&#x27;s theory is that people in the &quot;boondocks&quot; keep voting against infrastructure projects, even though &quot;cities majorly subsidize rural living through taxes.&quot; Now you&#x27;re saying that &quot;most areas need federal funds to keep up with these expenses.&quot;<p>Is California rich enough to pay for its infrastructure projects by itself, or does it need money from other states to do it? If @seattle_spring is right and California doesn&#x27;t need the money, then the Senate isn&#x27;t holding anything up. California can proceed unilaterally. Maybe they can even vote for Republicans at the federal level, who won&#x27;t make them continue to &quot;subsidize rural living&quot; in other states.<p>But if you&#x27;re correct that California &quot;need[s] federal funds to keep up with these expenses&quot; then why shouldn&#x27;t the rural states oppose it when it won&#x27;t benefit them?<p>The reality is two-fold.<p>1) People in dense urban states aren&#x27;t actually willing to spend this money, they just want to use these issues to get votes for Democrats. That&#x27;s why they never actually build these things when they have to do it with their own money only.<p>2) Dense urban states want access to the Federal government&#x27;s money printing machine. States cannot run structural deficits. But the rural urban states will be on the hook for that debt too.')
