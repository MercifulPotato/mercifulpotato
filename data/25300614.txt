If you&#x27;re infected, of course your mask will also be contaminated by SARS-CoV2, but you hopefully will not distribute as much of it around you as you would without the mask. If you&#x27;re not infected, the only way to contaminate the mask with SARS-CoV2 is to be exposed to infected people exhaling it. And in that case it&#x27;s better for your mask to become contaminated than to inhale it unfiltered.<p>As for the &quot;announcement effect&quot;, I did start wearing a mask when the mandatory mask policy was announced, before it became actually active in the following week. And I wasn&#x27;t the only one that did that, so some announcement effect is very plausible to me.')
