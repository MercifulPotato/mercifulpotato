From what I understand, content _is_ being generated and there are attempts to boost the SEO, so they&#x27;re providing a service and it&#x27;s not outright theft. At worst it just sounds like poor practice and gaming the system. They&#x27;re not acting maliciously, illegally, and&#x2F;or destructively, which is how I&#x27;ve always defined black-hat. Am I missing something?')
