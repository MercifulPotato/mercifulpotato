For me, a large document is 200-300 pages and 20-30 Meg in size saved in docx format.  I didn&#x27;t count but I&#x27;d probably have well over 50 images - maybe double that???  However, I do put my images in at a fairly low resolution (maybe 1280 x 800 or something) to keep the file size under control.  There is no noticable difference in the final product (at least for my purposes), it makes it practical to transfer my document back to our master file server over my peasant internet connection, and it keeps the file size reasonable enough to allow us to email a PDF version to our clients.  Word has some feature I can&#x27;t remember the name of off the top of my head that will optimize image sizes like this automagically for you.<p>Hope that is useful information for you.')
