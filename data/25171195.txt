Those financial aid programs are amazing, but I always did find it a bit unfair that the kids at the best schools are the same people getting the highest paying jobs that would be able to pay off loans if they had them.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that system, it&#x27;s great for the people it benefits, but just a bit sad is all.')
