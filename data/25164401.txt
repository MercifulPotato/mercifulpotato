The project:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinacahalan&#x2F;piano_waterfall" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinacahalan&#x2F;piano_waterfall</a><p>With his motherboard it was impossible to keep both FFT views scrolling at full speed if they were large. He ended up creating a circular buffer in video memory so that he would be able to reduce the PCIe traffic to just the fresh new edge of the data. The fix doesn&#x27;t work everywhere. Virtualization seems to break it, including with a Chromebook.<p>Is VkFFT a reasonable tool for attacking this problem? How difficult might it be to get the FFT result into the needed color component, gamma corrected and scaled, with all the other components?')
