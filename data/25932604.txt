The link puts you 11 minutes into the show, where the interview with Chamath Palihapitiya begins.<p>Palihapitiya is a regular guest on this show, but was invited to appear today because of the extraordinary price action in the common stocks of GameStop ($GME) and AMC Entertainment ($AMC) resulting from short squeezes on each stock.<p>The remarkable thing about what Palihapitiya says is that he criticizes the institutional investment community which operates hedge funds who use excessive leverage to bet against small investors who-- in this case-- have bet that the stock is oversold.<p>At one point today 140% of the total number of shares of $GME stock had been shorted (meaning it was borrowed and sold to others, with the expectation that the investors who borrowed the stock would be able to buy the stock back as shares of $GME fell from inflated levels).<p>The interview makes extensive reference to the &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets</a>, subreddit and constructive analysis of the trade setups for these stocks.<p>According to a related CNBC article, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;chamath-palihapitiya-closes-...</a>:<p>&quot;Instead of having ‘idea dinners’ or quiet whispered conversations amongst hedge funds in the Hamptons these kids have the courage to do it transparently in a forum,” he said. “What it proves is this retail [investor] phenomenon is here to stay. There are 2.7 million people inside wallstreetbets. I think they are as important as any hedge or collection of hedge funds.”<p>&quot;Palihapitiya claimed the best research on stocks done by retail investors inside wallstreetbets is nearly indistinguishable from the best research on Wall Street. “That edge is gone. Now all of a sudden, retail can be on the same footing and they don’t have to be the ‘bag-holder’ to Wall Street.”<p>I think a lot of people in this community will be interested in the idea that members of a subreddit can compete with institutional investors when the institutional investors&#x27; theses about a stock are either incorrect or so crowded that almost no one can make money trading with the institutional investors&#x27; strategy.')
