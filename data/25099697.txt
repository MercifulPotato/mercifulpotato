Their single benefit is nominal biodegradability.<p>It is far better for the environment if single use plastics are just minimized, for example by re-using all containers in your supply chain. This has therefore been our focus.<p>For the last mile to the consumer, however, it&#x27;s unfortunate that people are now used to disposables, so it&#x27;s likely going to take a technology shift like Dr. Zhu&#x27;s or an improved form of traditional techniques such as palm leaf wrapping (common in South and Southeast Asia) or single-use clay pottery (India) to improve the situation.<p>Our company have been considering sponsoring an open robotics challenge in this space (commercially viable deployments of traditional palm leaf wrapping).
