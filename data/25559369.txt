And both were biased in a direction the community hated (quite explicitly, and since before the change).<p>And the problem with Reddit didn&#x27;t stop at the design. Yeah, the new site is slow, ugly and hard to use, but the larger issue is that the new design favors video and memes over good content. If not for that point and the lots of on your face growth-hack, I don&#x27;t think the reaction would be that strong.<p>And none of those despised changes happened by bad luck or technical incompetence. They all come from managerial decisions. The technical act of redesigning can be harmful, but it&#x27;s not as risky as they examples make it look.')
