And that pink. GRX is a great a choice on these bikes.<p>The Dutch is brilliant. This fall I was able to go for a 50 mile ride with my mom, her on her step through ebike, me on my road bike. I never thought that would be a think we could do together. But- the thing is too damn heavy for her. If it drops she has a hard time picking it up. There&#x27;s not a chance she can bring it inside her home by herself. The dutch looks to solve all that at a comparable price point the ebike she has.<p>From the brand, solid warranty, good returns, a global launch.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see LeMond back on the scene with some funding, some great product, and what sounds like an interesting patent portfolio.')
