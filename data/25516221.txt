But in a super straightforward simple way.\nIt&#x27;s just ridiculous how quickly you can iterate on apps that use telegram as their frontend, so much cuft is left behind.<p>Telegram allows you to write apps that solve real needs, in a humane way.\nAnd as a dev that gives me hope that our industry isn&#x27;t lost just yet.')
