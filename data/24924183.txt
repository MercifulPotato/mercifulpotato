Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[24924640], score=None, time=1603919378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922565, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t get why people object to performance work on languages not intended for performance<p>My gut feeling is that Python is just not safe or static enough to ever be worth trying to compete with (say) C++ with. Python sure is easy but I think the asymptotic cost of using it for a big project (in my hands at least) is just not worth it.<p>I like Python&#x27;s syntax quite a bit but I feel bad watching people learn to program using it - partly because it&#x27;s an oddly low-level language (It&#x27;s closer to being C than Haskell) and there&#x27;s no compiler to stop you shooting yourself in the foot (If I write something fundamentally unsound I want to know about it <i>now</i> not when the process has been running all day)')
