(hopefully against RIAA, obviously, is my position)<p>But it brings up a side point in my mind -- how interesting is it that sometimes, a company, or university will have someone in their administration who cares enough to say, we&#x27;re going to take this on, and not roll over?  Or be willing to say, &quot;even though this is a small annoying cost to us individually, this nuisance is taking $B across everyone and should be stopped&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a very rare thing to see.  I remember only a couple of times this has gotten to the news in a major way:<p>-- When Newegg took those patent trolls to court<p>-- When Caltech, or was it MIT&#x2F;Harvard took the MPAA to court to say that they are not responsible for their students&#x27; hosting of content<p>I.e. not some non-profit or foundation dedicated to the topic, but an actual business that goes out of its way (and at cost to itself) to fight something.   I&#x27;m sure others can give better examples.  (And perhaps I&#x27;m not aware, but some industry association also helps back the lawsuit financially?)<p>But still, it takes some kind of courage of legal counsel, probably with backing of the CEO or president of the company, to take stands like this and actually make it a big deal and push back.<p>Funny how personality and individuals at corporations can still show through what you would think is otherwise bland legal daily life.  I almost take that as more of a brand equity enhancement &#x2F; reason that a company gains in reputation than sometimes its products.  Or maybe it&#x27;s those companies that have strong culture and brand that choose (or have the strength) to do this.<p>Anyway, the story just made me reflect on that.')
