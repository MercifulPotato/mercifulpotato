You cannot move the goal posts around regarding the nature of your application architecture and then claim that I am spreading FUD as a result. Strong type checking <i>across the scope of the entire problem domain</i> is the guarantee that I am ultimately looking for. Only if you compile your whole application into a single binary output do you get these guarantees.<p>I do not care that each microservice independently passes type checks. This is hardly a compelling argument if we are talking about delivering working products. The most critical points of verification in a system with multiple services are where all of these pieces connect back together.')
