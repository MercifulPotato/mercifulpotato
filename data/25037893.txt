Lack of safety is a feature in game development, because the optimizations required are typically unorthodox and a super strict language slows development down. Additionally, object ownership can be unclear in a game development setting, which typically makes use of global variables for state. The benefits of using Rust over C++ for game development are unclear in these regards.')
