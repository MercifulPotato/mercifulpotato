In the x86 world, hardware virtualization extensions don&#x27;t crop up until 2003. Efficient dynamic binary translation (a key component for efficient virtualization without hardware support) I generally reckon to start with DynamoRIO (~2001), with Intel&#x27;s Pin tool coming out in 2004.<p>(Do note that hardware virtualization does predate x86; I believe IBM 360 was the first one to have support for it, but I&#x27;m really bad with dates for processor milestones).')
