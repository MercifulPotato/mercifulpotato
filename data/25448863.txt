You think we can tell the big polluters to take it down to zero and just continue by ourselves? Not only is that incongruous, we wouldn&#x27;t be reaching 1.5Â°C either. Unless perhaps you pay for scrubbing of your CO2, which would be fine by me (I currently pay for Climeworks, not because I can reach net zero that way (yet) but because it helps them fund the way there, they just need enough customers; something tells me we&#x27;ll need scrubbing tech and capacity <i>in addition to</i> cutting emissions, seeing as the person above... let me just stop there).')
