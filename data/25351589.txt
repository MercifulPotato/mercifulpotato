Item(by='bogwog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607462843, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349565, text='&gt; many Android devices and apps are useless without Google&#x27;s proprietary services.<p>And not, in fact, open source. Due to the non-GPL license, every single Android device out there is effectively running a closed-source fork of AOSP.<p>I had an old Samsung device automatically install TikTok when I powered it on after sitting in a drawer for years. TikTok didn&#x27;t even exist when I bought the phone, yet someone with more control over my device than me sold the remote access (they gave themselves, without my consent) to TikTok.<p>Of course this is not a new development, but the proprietary BS and Google&#x27;s increasingly evil actions over the past decade really highlight how much of a problem that is. Trusting Fuchsia is just repeating that mistake.')
