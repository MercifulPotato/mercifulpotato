It is in my opinion the most important skill I have learned<p>- Asking why when debugging<p>Finding the code that&#x27;s causing a bug is only the first step. The next is preventing a similar one happening again. By constantly asking &quot;why was this choice made&quot;, you end up finding the actual weak points in both the code and your process. Whether it&#x27;s because a hack some other place forced you to write another hack, that then failed or because there was a deadline so the commit was made at 3am, there is an important lesson to be had. If you combine that with good communication, you can talk to the team about changing things, so you avoid creating similar bugs in the future. (Pro-tip: 99% of bugs are there because there wasn&#x27;t time to do things better)')
