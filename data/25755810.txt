Editing happens in Sublimetext, all under version control. I use Nikola because it&#x27;s written in Python and easy to customize. I use a daily blog-post as <i>inbox</i> for all thoughts&#x2F;notes&#x2F;todo&#x27;s during the day. And at the end of the day I write down what I did and what needs to be done tomorrow. And every project has it&#x27;s own project-page with outline, milestones, journal, etc. From time to time, sometimes at the same day, sometimes at the end of the week I review and move content from the daily posts to their corresponding pages.')
