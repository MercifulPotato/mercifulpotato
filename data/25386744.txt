Also given that I know that browsers can successfully load XML documents with XSLT (I’ve seen one or two web pages that actually do this), and that I know that the XML parser is accessible via DOMParser (this can be useful for some kinds of markup sanitisation), I’m not sure why I thought XHTML was completely dead in this way. Something’s niggling at the back of my mind, but I can’t place it.<p>I believe browsers would be quite within their rights to do DTD validation and consequently reject such a document as this, but they don’t actually do so. (Even if the DTD is specified correctly for XHTML 1.0 Strict, nothing changes.)<p>Thanks for correcting me. I have updated my mental knowledge repository.')
