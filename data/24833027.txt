Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603156251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24832462, text='&gt; exempt all drivers from getting basic benefits like health insurance<p>That wasn&#x27;t my understanding of it. This[1] says:<p>&gt; Companies that employ drivers through apps — among them, Lyft, Uber, DoorDash and Instacart — would instead keep workers classified as contractors and be able to offer narrower benefits, including pay at least 120% of minimum wage, health care subsidies and accident insurance.<p>&gt; Benefits under Prop. 22 would be tied to drivers’ “engaged time” completing passenger routes, excluding any wait time on apps between rides.<p>So if I understand right, current status quo is that companies aren&#x27;t obligated to pay squat, &quot;yes&quot; on prop 22 commits to certain pay guarantees (which I assume means some increase in price to cover for those costs), and &quot;no&quot; on prop 22 means companies have to use employee model (which they argue means large increases in prices, as well as reduction of coverage due to needing to follow taxi density logistics)<p>I tend to think about Uber in a similar way as McDonalds (i.e. lots of competition, but strong worldwide presence and strong brand), and I suspect that it will be more or less fine regardless of the outcome because of its strengths.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve had enough bad experiences with taxis that I can see the appeal for these companies wanting to maintain high driver volume. I guess what remains to be seen is whether &quot;yes&quot; would provide someone working 40 hours a week to get the same level of compensation as an employee would, while still allowing casual drivers to pocket extra money in between part time jobs or whatever.<p>The 120% of minimum wage + the possibility to earn linearly more given more hours certainly seems like a better outcome than an employee that makes exactly minimum wage for a maximum of exactly 40 hours, and hopefully other benefits are equally sensible, rather than a loophole for undercutting drivers. It would be great to get more clarity on how the rest of benefits numbers work out.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calmatters.org&#x2F;election-2020-guide&#x2F;proposition-22-gig-workers-ab-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calmatters.org&#x2F;election-2020-guide&#x2F;proposition-22-gi...</a>')
