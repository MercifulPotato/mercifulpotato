I have seen the characterzation of many of trump&#x27;s followers as white supremacists though.<p>Can you cite an example (and preferably multiple, since you said &quot;they&quot;) of the former, that his rallies are &quot;dangerous white supremacist meetings&quot;, and not simply the latter?<p>If not, I think it&#x27;s you who is engaging in hyperbole.<p>(I&#x27;ll also note the difference in tone between Trump&#x27;s address today from the Oval Office and his prior statements. Today, for the first time, he <i>didn&#x27;t</i> speak out of both sides of his mouth when discussing violence from his supporters. He unequivocally denounced violence. The difference between &quot;Stand back and stand by&quot; and &quot;Violence and vandalism have no place in our country and no place in our movement...no true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence&quot; is obvious. If his statements had been, from the beginning, that clear and unequivocal he would have faced far less criticism. I mean he clearly would have faced some, Biden faced criticism for repeated unequivocal denouncement of violence[0], from people to his right and left. I expect trump would have faced the same. But we probably wouldn&#x27;t have had last Wednesday, and Trump probably wouldn&#x27;t be facing down a second impeachment, nor enough upset Republican Senators that he might actually get convicted).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-biden-condemn-violence&#x2F;fact-check-joe-biden-has-condemned-violent-protests-in-the-last-three-months-idUSKBN25V2O1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-biden-condemn-v...</a>')
