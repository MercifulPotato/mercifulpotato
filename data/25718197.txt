Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=[25719385], score=None, time=1610305251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717764, text='&gt; Reproduction is a fundamental function of your organism, whether you chose to use it or not (for example, I am not going to reproduce). Any entity forcefully removing your body&#x27;s ability to perform any of its fundamental functions is obviously abhorrent. If the state were seeking to remove your ability to see or your ability to consume food or excrete it, would you find that a matter of definitions?<p>And what test or criteria might you use to decide what is and isn&#x27;t a “fundamental function of one&#x27;s organism”?<p>&gt; By contrast, male circumcision and teeth straitghening are essentially cosmetic differences.<p>It is not so much the result of both that I find problematic as the painful methodology by which they are achieved.<p>Cutting up a man <i>sans</i> any anæsthesia, sewing him back up, and leaving him otherwise alive but with a scar is also merely cosmetic; it was, however, rather painful for him.<p>&gt; I have no idea where you have seen this. I haven&#x27;t even seen the sex or gender of the person being potentially sterilized discussed at all in any discussion of the horror of forced sterilization. Certainly nowhere in this thread or even the deleted tweet.<p>It has been well discussed and noted that physicians seem to be far more willing to perform elective sterilizations on males than on females and find some kind of greater moral fault with the latter than the former.<p>&gt; it isn&#x27;t, anymore than gouging your eyes or removing your inner ear would be).<p>And I would submit that most, if not nigh all human beings when given the dilemma of either surrendering their reproductive capacity or an eye, would surely pick the former.<p>It&#x27;s telling that human beings willingly surrender their reproductive capacity all the time, but I have seldom heard of a man who decided to have a healthy eye removed simply because he wanted himself rid of it.<p>So yes, I consider removing a man&#x27;s reproductive capacity to be quite trivial and inconsequential compared to removing his eye.<p>Which of both would you choose?')
