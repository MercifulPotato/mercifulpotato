Discord will ban Ripcord, and Ripcord users, if it ever gets popular. They&#x27;ve already said that Ripcord is a violation of the terms of service. They&#x27;ve banned third party before and will again.<p>&gt; All 3rd party apps or client modifiers are against our ToS, and the use of them can result in your account being disabled. I don&#x27;t recommend using them. - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;discord&#x2F;status&#x2F;1229357198918197248" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;discord&#x2F;status&#x2F;122935719891819724...</a><p>They make their money by selling their users and they can&#x27;t do that if they allow other clients. So they have their policy of not allowing it and banning all third party. Of course they only act when it begins to effect their money. So for now ripcord is usable.')
