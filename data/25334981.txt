Pretty much no allergic reactions to either raw or ripe mangos (in me or anyone I know), unless you call a bit of irritation or sensitivity around the edges of the lips, a reaction, that too, only with more acidic raw mangos (or maybe also with the skin of ripe mangos). I say &quot;more acidic&quot; because there are some less acidic, almost non-acidic varieties that we used to love and gorge on as kids - named Rajapuri or Totapuri mangos. A bit larger than the average ripe mango. Mild but really good tangy flavor. We used to eat them with  pinches of salt, but they were tasty enough to  eat without. I think a little sweet-sour. And you could eat a large amount without getting a stomach upset, like a couple of them.<p>Edit: Those were raw mangos.')
