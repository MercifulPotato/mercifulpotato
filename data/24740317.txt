It would probably be the same under any administration. Abuse of the current system essentially incentivises consulting companies to compete with each other based on salary structure. The ones willing to lay existing workers off fast enough, and repeat often enough, have a steady supply of low-cost workers and can undercut their competition. Other companies are forced to copy in a race to the bottom. This is obviously hurtful to the laid-off workers and their families, and to the unemployment insurance system&#x27;s balance sheet. So there are obvious, purely functional and apolitical reasons to re-adjust the incentives.')
