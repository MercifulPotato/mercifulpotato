If someone puts in effort to help you or contribute to something you&#x27;ve created, just be a decent person and respond to them. It costs you nothing. There&#x27;s a difference between being entitled to something and just doing something because it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>The idea that this costs them nothing is, well, garbage. It costs time and energy, of which many have a very limited supply. What might take you 5 minutes might take another an hour and leave them utterly drained.')
