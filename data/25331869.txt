We&#x27;re seeing occurrences of &#x27;the plague&#x27; and TB in skid row. This is what happens when we allow people to living in squalor.<p>At some point we as a society need to make a statement that living outside, even seemingly by choice, especially in context of mental illness or drug addiction is not something that should be respected or tolerated.<p>We&#x27;re at the point where cities (spurred on by activists) have exempted homeless population from all municipal regulations and decided that allowing people with drug addiction and mental illness to live in squalor, and filth is a basic human right that trumps forceful institutionalization. I really don&#x27;t understand why forced institutionalization into highly regulated institutions, staffed by clinical professionals is so evil.<p>Worse, a social worker friend of mine in the homeless space, highlighted one issue that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of. She says she sees young people who are &#x27;homeless&#x27; as a lifestyle choice, using (and draining) resources earmarked for the chronic homeless (typically those suffering from mental illness). She is convinced that this group is at least partially responsible for the large part of the waste in this space.')
