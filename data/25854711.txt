For example:<p>log.debug(&quot;Unexpected, got %r&quot;, (got,))<p>By doing it this way, it can defer rendering the string until it is actually needed, which is (assumed to be) a win when the logging module is normally just going to toss the low level messages away rather than emit them anywhere.<p>I think you lose this optimization if you use f-strings. I don&#x27;t think rendering of the string can be lazy, deferred until actually needed.')
