Have you? I think it&#x27;s remarkably sadder that people have to deal with pain like this. And you jump right to wanting to lock up people and take your revenge. Isn&#x27;t that a rather sad state of affairs?<p>I&#x27;ve been in the presence of people who need pain medicines like OxyContin and who are not able to continue living without it. Not because they&#x27;re addicts, but because they have horrendous medical conditions caused by all sorts of things, ranging from US armed conflict all the way to cooking accidents while on the job at a restaurant.<p>For however many people you think are addicted and killed by drugs like OxyContin, there are far more people that are in need of drugs like these through no fault of their own, and often times, directly due to the very same politicians who are now celebrating this &quot;takedown&quot; of Purdue.<p>The difficulty one of these individuals had in obtaining their necessary Oxycodone during the COVID-19 lockdowns resulted in him attempting suicide. This person is not alone in this dilemma. The ridiculous scapegoating and guilt-tripping of this drug has led to the ruination of countless lives as well. Many people are suffering right now because some people think it&#x27;s a corporation&#x27;s fault when they choose to put a highly effective narcotic into their system.<p>We can&#x27;t send people to foolish overseas conflicts, require people to engage in dangerous jobs like oil rigging and construction work, and then not give them medicine to make their on-the-job injuries livable. Doctors are the ones who make decisions about what to prescribe - they are the ones who commit the fraud of prescribing unnecessary medicines. If you&#x27;re truly so eager to throw someone into a cage for their terrible crimes against humanity, you may want to start with the doctors and politicians before the wealthy, greedy Sacklers. I know that doesn&#x27;t fit into the neat little boxes on top of which people love to grandstand these days, but the truth is a lot more valuable than filthy, emotionally-driven platitudes.')
