Hiltzik&#x27;s <i>Dealers of Lightning</i> about the heyday of computing research at Xerox PARC isn&#x27;t universally praised (IIRC it&#x27;s more or less Bob Metcalfe&#x27;s version of the story) but it is very readable.<p>Bob Johnstone&#x27;s <i>We Were Burning</i>, about the golden age of Japanese consumer electronics (wich also covers many events and actors in the US and UK).<p>David Kushner&#x27;s <i>Masters of Doom</i>, about the heyday of Id Software.<p><i>The First Computersâ€”History and Architectures</i> is a more academic book, a selection of history papers, but it&#x27;s still very readable.
