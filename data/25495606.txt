Anyone <i>who is already a user</i> can. If you restrict distribution of the binaries, you also restrict the amount of people who can get the sources. You cannot impose NDAs or the likes, but you can introduce some restrictions on their overall privileges going forward (i.e. you republish sources? No more patches or support for you - which is basically what RH does with their paying customers).<p>RH could stop publishing sources entirely, if they really wanted to, and just provide them to paying customers on request. They don&#x27;t do that because it&#x27;s a nuclear option that would effectively push them out of the Linux ecosystem they&#x27;ve invested so much into dominating (RH is effectively the one company who can steer massive amounts of the Linux ecosystem on its own - as shown by systemd <i>et al</i>).')
