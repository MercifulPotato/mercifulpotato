This isn&#x27;t much of a surprise, since they stopped giving any updates pretty quickly into the pandemic.<p>I have family that live in China.  Government officials are fired if Covid spreads at all, which will only result in officials fudging the numbers to save their job.<p>Vietnam used some of the same tactics and Australia is mostly desert and an island that is easy to control when it comes to borders.<p>There was a rumor that Trump mentioned to a book author that he thought Covid was airborne..and people lost their shit and wanted him in jail.  If he implemented the same tactics as China, he would be on trial for mass murder.<p>The US is punished for actually telling the truth about Covid and testing.  It seems like many people would much rather hear complete lies about the numbers to make themselves feel better.<p>Trump warned us back in January and wanted to close the borders and the Democrats told us to hug an Asian person and go to Chinese new year celebrations.<p>Taiwan warned the WHO back in December and was promptly dismissed.  The mainstream US media silenced anyone that went against the WHO.<p>Corrupt organizations like the WHO and the government of China are to blame.  China caused this mess and covered it up for months.')
