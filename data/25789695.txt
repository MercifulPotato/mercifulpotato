I&#x27;ve tried it at least once a year and it still has\nthe same issues it had on day one. The UI is incredibly slow and\nhas an input delay on most mouse inputs. I gave up on it when\nthey introduced Philips Hue remote controls instead of fixing\nthe overall user experience or adding features like bookmark &amp;\nsettings sync(Light controls don&#x27;t have a place in a web\nbrowser, ever, unless it&#x27;s an opt-in addon).<p>The vast number of settings and features is great, but that&#x27;s\nmeaningless if the everyday browsing feels like using a bloated\nwebsite on a Raspberry Pi.')
