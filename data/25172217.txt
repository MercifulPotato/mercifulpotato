Eastern (Communist) Germany painted itself as an &quot;anti-fascist state by definition&quot;, but in reality there were <i>awful lots</i> of Neo-Nazis active in the GDR - and after the Mauerfall Western cadres only had to move in to find faithful people. It&#x27;s estimated that there were 15.000 (!) Neo-Nazis at the time.
