But a powermeter is a closer approximation since the effort is captured. In cycling, if you don&#x27;t have a power meter the estimate would be based on distance and climb and won&#x27;t factor wind or other external factors.<p>Also, I know it&#x27;s definitely greater than the Watch estimate. With a below average cardio I can&#x27;t bike the distance or climb I do on average. I did 3 metric centuries last year (with climbs over 4000ft each), for example.')
