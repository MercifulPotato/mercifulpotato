Let&#x27;s say a company is good at what it does, but then becomes a monopoly that can dictate unfavorable terms and capture the surplus, was it an efficiency gain on the whole? Let&#x27;s say companies do very well, but deplete natural resources and lobby against infrastructure projects, did society gain as a result? These questions are naturally difficult to answer but there&#x27;s at least more to the story than just the inductive reasoning of creative destruction fixing everything. Less efficient actors getting booted out is only a small part of the process as usually the consequences are on the second order range.')
