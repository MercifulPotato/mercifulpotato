Everybody has to agree on what&#x27;s stored. But the way it normally works is that each entity gets to do its own thing. E.g., if company A sends a package received by company B via shipper C, each one is going to keep their own records of what&#x27;s going on. They don&#x27;t have to agree at all on what gets kept when. There are specific, limited points of interaction. It&#x27;s only if some problem occurs that everybody compares their individual records and reconciles them.<p>That looks like waste to the &quot;blockchain [jazz hands]&quot; crowd. But it prevents other wastes. Like trying to get a whole industry to come to consensus on ontology and process. Or trying to comply with systems build around that fantasy process when local needs differ from the standards.')
