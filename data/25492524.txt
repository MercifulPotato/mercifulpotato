Item(by='SulphurCrested', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608531026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492318, text='In the late 1970s&#x2F;early 1980s VAX hard drives usually took cartridges which could be conveniently unplugged and carried across to a drive on another machine. But by 1986 drives were often &quot;Winchesters&quot; - sealed, rack width, a foot high, and weighing maybe 100kg. The cables were an inch thick and the plugs the size of a large ham and cheese sandwich. Hence the comment in the article that they&#x27;d need to pay a DEC technician to come out and physically do the move.')
