Many will say &quot;we need better laws! punish those police!&quot;. Why even give them the opportunity to use your data maliciously in the first place? Why place all that trust into a complex system, a system with so many points of failure? It&#x27;s inherently untrustworthy. &quot;Oh, we won&#x27;t use your data for malicious purposes, promise ;)&quot;. All it takes is one bad actor to inherit that system to cause problems. Again, don&#x27;t even give them the opportunity; don&#x27;t forfeit your freedom to begin with.<p>Delete your facebook. Delete your twitter. Get rid of your spyphone. Breathe the free air again.')
