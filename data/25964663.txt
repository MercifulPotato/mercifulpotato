This is also why hedge funds have prime accounts directly with bulge brackets. My recommendation is to always have at least two accounts plus Fidelity. FIDO, while expensive, invested a ton of money into their platform&#x2F;technology. I rarely see them go down. Plus they basically own everything including cryptos. Key is to have multiple accounts and know how to wire money without even looking up the information so that youâ€™re up and running in minutes not hours or days.')
