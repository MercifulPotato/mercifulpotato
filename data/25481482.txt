They are well known for experimenting to maximize engagement and growth. And we know they already do topic modeling and interest tracking, as that drives ad targeting.<p>So in their shoes I&#x27;d be looking at newsfeed articles about Facebook, user sentiment in the post text and the comments, and subsequent impact on UAM and DAU numbers.<p>In their shoes, I&#x27;d also be tracking the performative departure. I&#x27;ve seen a number of people post about Facebook and saying they&#x27;re quitting. It wouldn&#x27;t be hard to look back at what they&#x27;ve been reading and forward at the impact on their friends who read the post.<p>If I needed more data, I&#x27;d tie all this in with user surveys and user studies for deeper qualitative and quantitative data. Not sure if Facebook does those, but I know other platforms do.')
