I guess if you&#x27;re a hardware implementer and poke around you&#x27;ll find people saying it&#x27;s not USB-C, but that&#x27;s not in any way Nintendo being explicit. Why they might have been explicit about would be to never use anything that wasn&#x27;t Nintendo branded at a major markeup. After the last few decades of profiteering a lot of users have been trained to assume that the only reason is money.')
