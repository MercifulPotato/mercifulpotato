In a Turing space is all you need to implement every other program. Arguments that &quot;there exists no program&quot; come with an inherent verifiability criterion of &quot; well here&#x27;s one.&quot; The thing that Oracle is pissy about is that things get transpired out of Java Byte code, into Dalvik or ART.<p>Oracle wants patent like protections for the output of Java, and overall API structure in all languages. They want copyright on a meta-pattern. Just trying to imply skulduggery to &quot;look, they joined our API structure, and didn&#x27;t even do a good job of it, so they should have to pay us for infringement&quot; is a transparent farce.
