I was a mid level product engineer at a recently IPOd company (joined 2 years pre IPO). My base salary was $200k, and the stock and bonus more than doubled that.<p>There was a little bit of “pick the rocket ship” gamble - I had an Uber offer that probably would have been ended more like $250k&#x2F;year, but it’s not unreasonable to get half a mill joining a late stage pre-IPO startup, and base salary is high enough you do it with little risk.<p>Hell, I know some mid-level post-IPO folks at Square making $700k due to it 10xing in share price.')
