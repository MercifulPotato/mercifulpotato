People can and do coordinate over long time spans and multiple generations. Heck, that&#x27;s basically what a corporation is.<p>&gt; compounding interest will only grow his wealth further<p>Only insofar as they have deferred consumption for longer. This is how interest works.<p>&gt; At the end of it, they have $358,816,... a huge amount of money.<p>Signifying the economic benefit from deferring consumption and instead putting those resources to productive use. This is a Good Thing.<p>&gt; So any interest paid to the traveler should be calculated at the fraction of time experienced, so 5 minutes to 5 days would be 1 &#x2F; 1440.<p>As you&#x27;ve described it, those travelers will already be more inclined to accept a lower interest rate than non-travelers.
