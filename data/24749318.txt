Nearly 7 years.<p>This has cost me thousands and thousands of dollars.<p>My logic is that when I use a computer, it&#x27;s the monitor that I&#x27;m looking at. I don&#x27;t sit next to the case staring at RGB LEDs. I can&#x27;t &quot;experience&quot; a processor in any aspect except speed, and that&#x27;s been perfectly acceptable for a decade.<p>But I&#x27;ll stare at the screen for 8 hours a day for work, and an additional few hours at home.<p>Spending money on improving the image quality of something I <i>look at</i> for 10+ hours a day is absolutely worthwhile!<p>This is also the advice I give people: Buy a bigger, better monitor than you planned, and make sacrifices elsewhere. A larger 4K monitor is a <i>very visible</i> upgrade in the literal sense versus, say, a few hundred more megahertz on the processor.')
