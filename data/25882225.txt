The point was mostly that the .NET GC can get away with not being as advanced since it commonly has to do less work than in Java anyway. C# gives the developer more low-level control over what actually runs on the CPU in the end, so there&#x27;s a slight shift in responsibility for performance from the JIT&#x2F;GC towards the developer (although the latter two also improve, of course).<p>______<p>¹ Plus a number of algorithmic improvements and the ability to leverage specific CPU instructions that help as well.')
