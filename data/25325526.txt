I enjoy reading (and still read fiction), and I <i>want</i> to have that motivation, but I just can&#x27;t seem to muster it. This includes books that have good reviews, because apparently a lot of people don&#x27;t seem to mind. It just seems like there&#x27;s a lot of people writing books because it&#x27;s &quot;the thing to do&quot; and probably makes more money than the couple blog posts or long article that would have been a better format.<p>Anyone else experience this, and how did you get past it?')
