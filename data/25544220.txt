I’m most familiar with F#, so I’ll use it as my example,  but it is built on .Net just like C# and VB. That means you not only get access to all of the features they offer, but in a functional language that doesn’t enforce any of them on you.<p>Microsoft was clearly going for a best of both worlds approach - .Net if you need it, just your data if you don’t. I find it a pain in the ass, but all the data guys at work love it because they can mix and match with our existing code and still do their own thing.')
