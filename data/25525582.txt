I get panic attacks thinking about this regularly. I’ve heard all sorts of answers to this question, “accept what you can’t control” being the prevailing theme.<p>The issue for me has been that while that advice is easy to hand out and to some degree I agree with it, it doesn’t say anything about how to reach that point of acceptance.<p>I’ve tried a lot of things to alleviate these panic attacks, and that’s as successful as I’ve been so far.<p>The answer: meditation and medication.<p>I visited a psychiatrist this year after a particularly difficult time and got diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. The doctor put me on a program where I started with natural alternatives, I was hesitant to try medication. But eventually, once it was clear that the natural remedies were not working, I put my reservations aside and tried the medication the doctor prescribed. And lo and behold, it’s actually helped. I don’t get the panic attacks as often and when I do they are not as bad.<p>There is only so much that medication will do for you however. My psychiatrist recommended I a read a book called “10 percent happier”, and this has helped become more aware about what goes on in my mind and what my body is trying to tell me.<p>P.S. - this has worked for me YMMV.')
