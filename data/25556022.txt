Most complex systems share those properties. It makes glaringly obvious that isolating blame&#x2F;personal responsibility has limited effectiveness in preventing accidents. While we need a blame assignment system that&#x27;s clear to reason about for financial reasons, for other systems where that need isn&#x27;t so great, more effort ends up getting spent on figuring out how to prevent outages than assigning blame for them.')
