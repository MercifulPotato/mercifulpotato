It&#x27;s a hassle, and if I have to pay for every thing I want to click on, I&#x27;m mostly not going to click anything at all.  Even if it&#x27;s just pennies.  It is the epitome of &#x27;getting nickled and dimed to death&#x27;.<p>I expect the future of the &#x27;net is a collection of walled gardens, where you pay just once and get everything from news to music, movies, etc.  Basically what Apple is trying to do now, among others.  The independent news sources will have to negotiate contracts to be in these gardens, except for a few stand-out services that are so good people will pay for them directly.')
