Nobody issues with SHA-1 any more, haven&#x27;t for several years. It&#x27;s almost all SHA-256 and at Let&#x27;s Encrypt I believe it always has been because SHA-1 deprecation was already well underway before they span up Let&#x27;s Encrypt so it would have made no sense to implement that only to immediately rip it back out.')
