What&#x27;s actually happening is we&#x27;re seeing something in the present moment (thinking memories in the present moment too) and that thing we&#x27;re seeing causes an emotional response, often an unconscious one.   The unconscious mind then looks for neighboring memories by emotional lookup and brings those familiar memories up into conscious thought, which is how ideas pop up in our head.<p>This is a pretty profound insight, because for example, it means when one is in a depressed state, if it is strong enough, all they can remember is memories of being in a similar emotional state causing a memory compartmentalization.  This forgetting of positive memories makes depression seem like it&#x27;s forever.  One helpful thing is a photo of a good memory, or a letter to ones self, or another form of nostalgia, which can then pull the person out of the depressed episode.  For some people it&#x27;s enough to end the depression then and there in its tracks.<p>Likewise, from this understanding, it can be easy to see the challenge therapists face regarding depression and other memory compartmentalization related psychological disorders, because their patient forgets instructions that could help them when they need it most.<p>This also shows how manipulation works.  How, emotional language can determine how a person thinks, programming them.  One fun experiment is to watch a bit of Fox and look at the emotions instead of what they&#x27;re directly saying.  You&#x27;ll start to see things like they&#x27;re telling people to not trust others, for example, or like how they were saying anything regarding Biden is boring, so you shouldn&#x27;t watch it, and so on.  Manipulation is controversial to talk about, but so is depression, so fuck it.  Let&#x27;s have some fun.  ^_^')
