Did you know that your common household 120v feed is simply a single phase being split into two 120v &#x27;legs&#x27;. Both 120 degrees out of phase. So if you remember elementary school math the abs() of phase A at its peak of +120 and phase B at it&#x27;s valley of -120 = 240.</i><p>The two legs are <i>180</i> degrees &quot;out of phase&quot; (that is to say one is simply the negative to the other). The peaks on each are +&#x2F;- <i>170</i> volts, with a total peak across both of <i>340</i> volts. But we talk about AC in terms of RMS voltage, which is the DC-equivalent voltage that would perform the same work into a resistor, which is a factor of sqrt(2) for a sine wave, or &quot;120&#x2F;240 volts&quot;.')
