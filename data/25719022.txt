Either I&#x27;m some genius (I&#x27;m not), or what you see online is what you get: 99% garbage.<p>The way people discuss online censorship is like that scene from Star Wars &#x27;I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.&#x27;<p>Facebook Twitter et al are just companies, and companies come and go. They are a source of amusement, to be sure, but, at their most serious, they spread more darkness than light. Sci-hub is more likely to contribute to a cure for cancer, or heart disease. If Instagram called it quits tomorrow, it would no more detriment the life of the average person than if a restaurant or a disco they liked went out of business.<p>In short: these social media websites, as designed, are just bad at, for lack of a better phrase, &#x27;enlightenment stuff&#x27;. Millions of people use them (sure, someone pooped out a good physics paper on 4chan, even) but they mainly produce memes and self-promotional nonsense. Not worth ruining liberal democracy, and social harmony over.')
