If it&#x27;s not that often, you might be served fine with something like<p><pre><code>  sed -i &#x27;s&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;g&#x27; **.rb\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not precise, so it might take some manual work and tweaking with the patterns, but for how often I&#x27;ve had to rename identifiers, it works good enough to handle the bulk work.<p>A bit of forethought when first naming things works wonders, too.')
