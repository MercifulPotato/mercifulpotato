Unless you consider the IMU and feedback loops that keep it level &quot;autonomous&quot;, since it is technically some degree of autonomy...<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d be a little more specific and say something is &quot;bricked&quot; when it cannot be repaired with the speaker&#x27;s skill level or equipment.<p>Ultimate bricking would be frying an IC with e.g. heat or ESD.
