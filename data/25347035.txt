Item(by='RobertKerans', descendants=None, kids=[25349516], score=None, time=1607443497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341558, text='&gt; What it seems to lack, which I find a sticking point whenever I consider some greenfield personal project, is the dizzying array of &#x27;tooling stuff&#x27; that JS has, and how it does or doesn&#x27;t fit together, etc. There&#x27;s just all sorts of weird layers and not quite equivalents and can be equivalents but could also be used togethers, half the stuff it&#x27;s not even clear what it is or if it&#x27;s necessary at all.<p>Aha, yes, this. I am [currently] a JavaScript person and it is a shitshow. The clich√© used to point and laugh at JS is framework churn, but that&#x27;s not really much of a thing [imo], it&#x27;s the tooling. The tools can be genuinely very good <i>if</i> you pick the right combination in the right context, but that&#x27;s often more luck than judgement.<p>I suspect as wasm usage becomes more widespread, it&#x27;ll get worse, not better, at least for a while. There&#x27;s always a shining future to hope for (and despite the gripes, things have generally improved steadily over the years, so not <i>too</i> idealistic a hope).<p>If Rome[1] fulfils its goals (big if), then you might get what you want. Very early days though, and going to be very hard for the maintainers to keep control as the scope of the project expands.<p>Aside, but I think it would be interesting to figure out how much cargo culting is going on with JS tooling. Theory: most configurations of tooling beyond &quot;install CRA&#x2F;similar&quot; are built up via Googling done when building out highly context-specific configs -&gt; that brings back articles on how to set up tooling that was specific to the author&#x27;s particular situation -&gt; they are used in lieu of the tool&#x27;s documentation because Things Just Need To Get Done Now and it&#x27;s just some dev dependencies, whatever -&gt; those configs are used in a situation they aren&#x27;t needed -&gt; process repeats.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rome.tools&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rome.tools&#x2F;</a>')
