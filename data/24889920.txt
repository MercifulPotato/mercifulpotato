It’s cheaper to raise your own, but you will get traits that are undesirable, aggression being one.<p>The drones in a hive are not all raised there, they move about hives, so killing the hive won’t get them all.<p>Hives that have got a laying worker are also very hard to requeen and it usually isn’t possible. One way is to shake all the bees out some distance away then hope the laying worker doesn’t make it back to the hive (she can’t fly). However those hives are hard to fix, as they usually reject the new queen.<p>There is a lot of differences in beekeeping region to region and country to country, so whatever I have seen and done may be very different to other places.')
