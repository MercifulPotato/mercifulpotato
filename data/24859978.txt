So assembly code that does stuff with the GPU just looks like loading a shared library, passing in some shader code, and then passing in some drawing commands. This project looks like it aims to compile rust to a shader intermediate format so you can use it instead of more common shading languages like GLSL or HLSL. Basically your HLSL&#x2F;GLSL&#x2F;(now Rust) code ends up as an intermediate format, which the CPU passes in to a graphics driver before asking that driver to draw things.')
