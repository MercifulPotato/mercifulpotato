Mastery is achieved when you do; do practice problems, do timed tests, discuss concepts with those better, equal or worse than you, etc.<p>The value add of teachers at your school&#x2F;university is that they assign problems to you at the average skill level of the class, and they give space for discussions, but most importantly change the difficulty of the course, or go over stuff in a different way if you fail to understand.<p>If you want to create good remote education, you will have to at least create these values as well.')
