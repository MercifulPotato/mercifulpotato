Item(by='cbthrow91', descendants=None, kids=[25234478, 25234563], score=None, time=1606528529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234286, text='It&#x27;s unclear but I think when it&#x27;s mentioned PHL employee is able to work remote, they mean they are able to work out of the NYC office which is remote relative to the PDX office. It was not my read that they are working remote from home.<p>Your wording speculates on how the communication around remote was delivered in an unfavorable light. We know the decision was made to end WFH&#x2F;remote, and one employee managed to get permission to work from the NYC office. A more realistic (still speculative) scenario imo:<p>-Company announces end of wfh&#x2F;remote for a team. Folks are asked to relocate to PDX.\n-Employee asks for permission to work from NYC. Request is approved.')
