My personal favorite is &quot;Confession of a mask&quot; for its ambiguous feelings.<p>On the literary side, the article does mention the &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; tetralogy where the second volume is the most political, with a surprising depiction of an idealistic coup that cannot succeed. But the quality of this tetralogy clearly goes down with each volume.')
