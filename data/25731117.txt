But is this a logical assertion? Isn&#x27;t this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn&#x27;t this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn&#x27;t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God&#x27;s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion?<p>We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.</i><p>MLK Jr., 1963<p>&quot;don&#x27;t refuse to do business with them because they&#x27;re violent thugs! that&#x27;ll make them act like violent thugs!&quot; is a very stupid line of argument.')
