Patents are for non-obvious inventions, and they exist to encourage sharing that invention&#x27;s details with the public.<p>The idea is that a patented invention is novel enough that it&#x27;s unlikely someone else would independently invent it, so the patent encourages the inventor to share all the details of the invention (and in exchange gives them a monopoly on it). Patents are specifically _not_ for good ideas that aren&#x27;t non-obvious inventions. You can&#x27;t patent the idea of &quot;1 click buying&quot; or &quot;a time machine&quot;, only an actual invention&#x2F;implementation that does those things.<p>I agree amazon&#x27;s 1-click experience is a really good idea. It&#x27;s also well designed and implemented. The question though is whether some other developer could, given the idea of &quot;1 click buy&quot;, create this &quot;invention&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s unquestionable that, given the problem statement, many other developers of the time could have created the same thing.<p>In fact, a bunch of other developers have already created 1-click buy buttons, and I assure you the vast majority did not read amazon&#x27;s patent to figure out how to write that code.<p>The fact that people can build this invention without looking at amazon&#x27;s patent, to me, proves it should not be patentable. The general public gained nothing from the patent.')
