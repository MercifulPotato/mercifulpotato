Who knows, maybe someone at parler knew and never raised the issue because they were disgruntled and actively shot down security measures....kind of like what I did before<p>Basically a startup I worked for 12 years ago were fucking me big time on compensation so I purposefully argued against encrypting the database knowing how shoddy their security was. I didn&#x27;t allow ANYONE to secure the backend. 4 years later, their database gets leaked and they get &quot;acquired&quot; for an &quot;undisclosed amount&quot; which usually means they sold themselves at a huge discount pending lawsuits.<p>No regrets. They were the single most worst offenders of labor exploitation. Serious human rights violations were going on and I did what I had to do. Take them down with the same incomptence they have shown towards me and others they exploited.')
