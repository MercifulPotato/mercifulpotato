Reddit is holding for $1000, but there comes a point where the funds would be so unable to fulfil their shorts that any ones left holding it will declare bankruptcy rather than pay, and you lose yours too.<p>Even if you&#x27;re willing to risk throwing away some money to &quot;stick it to the man&quot;, it will take a while - It may be easier in the US, but I signed up to Degiro to get some shares a couple of months ago and it was a fairly lengthy process even for Europe&#x27;s closest equivalent to Robinhood.
