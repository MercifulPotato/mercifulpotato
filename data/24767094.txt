You could use photons to do the measurement but there are other ways which all have the same result.<p>It&#x27;s a mystery how the particle &quot;knows&quot; (In other words, nobody knows when the wave function collapses) but one popular interpretation is that the particle exists in all states, i.e. in a pure description of reality. When any quantum system interacts with it, then it becomes entangled with the result of that measurement, branching it into a new universe (edit for clarification: a new world where it was as if it was never a wave, and it was always a particle). That&#x27;s my understanding of the many-worlds theory.<p>That entanglement propagates across nearby particles, so it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with eyes or consciousness. If the air molecules around your body interact with the particle then that entanglement propagates through your body and places you in the new world.')
