Having children really makes some people entirely unable to think. I&#x27;ve heard people entirely willing to outlaw any form of encryption to &quot;protect&quot; their children from pedophiles despite the likelihood of getting their identity stolen, bankrupt and unable to feed their children  being significantly higher than a pedophile targeting their child even now, and would increase by several orders of magnitude if we suddenly weren&#x27;t allowed to encrypt things like e-banking and email.')
