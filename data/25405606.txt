Some blame this exclusively on Carly Fiorina, but I want to hear from more people knowledgeable about the situation at HP during this time, since I heard from somewhere that the board was interested in moving away from the HP Way, and they hired Fiorina precisely to change HP.<p>From the 1970s until the late 1990s, HP&#x27;s calculators were renowned for their build quality, similar to how IBM ThinkPads were renowned for their quality.  However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some high-quality calculators such as the HP-32SII and HP-48GX were replaced by calculators like the HP-33S and HP-49G, respectively, that did not have the same build quality.  This led to HP&#x27;s older calculators being sold on eBay and other secondhand markets at high prices.  (Thankfully HP&#x27;s calculator quality would improve in the late 2000s with the HP-35S and HP-50g.)<p>I&#x27;ve heard similar things about HP&#x27;s printers and personal computers; there is a discernible difference in quality between those built before the late 1990s and those built afterwards.')
