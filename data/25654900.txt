I didn&#x27;t fund that many projects as I got burned by a couple, and a couple more were pretty underwhelming, but I used to like browsing it to see what innovative ideas people had (often my favourite were too far out of the norm, so never got funded).<p>Nowadays I see ads for Kickstarter and other crowd funding sites popup in my feeds quite a lot. The product is often interesting, but then when I look into it I realise it&#x27;s an existing product, available now on AliExpress, that&#x27;s just rebranded. The &#x27;founders&#x27; of course give their &#x27;story&#x27; about how they are tirelessly making this innovative product to change the world.<p>One notable example was a set of silicon lids for pans and plates as a replacement for plastic wrap. I saw the product, and was actually quite tempted to fund it as it wasn&#x27;t very expensive (&lt;$20), but it still had quite a while left for the campaign to complete and the estimated delivery was a few months away. I then found exactly the same product on AliExpress, for less than half the price, and it arrived before the campaign had finished funding :D')
