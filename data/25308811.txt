Feels assuring knowing I&#x27;m not alone (although clearly in the minority) waving my hands at how crude and ineffective the common advice to &quot;do leetcode&quot; really is. That training site idea sounds exciting, much better than what exists today.<p>The key perspective shift from me was from \n- &quot;I need to solve 200 leetcode problems before I can approach interviews with confidence&quot; \nto \n- &quot;Here are 50 techniques. Most solutions use a combination of these&quot;<p>I started my journey splitting things into buckets (Arrays, Strings, Binary tree, BST, Stacks, Linked List, Matrix, Graphs, DP). I went through EPI and Leetcode populating those buckets. I started solving the easies for a month. Built a repo of questions and links so huge, it would take me years (really, years) to get through it sequentially. That was depressing and with no sense of immediate reward, gave up.<p>A few weeks later, I decided to reduce scope and focus only on Arrays, Strings, BST and Graphs. Turns out that isn&#x27;t a great approach either as there are a lot of overlaps between Array and String problems and by the time I got to the string problem that used a technique similar to what I had used in a problem in Arrays, i&#x27;d forgotten most of it anyway. Repeated this a few time and it gave me the impression that I couldn&#x27;t remember shit, I wasn&#x27;t cut out for this and gave up, again.<p>My latest attempt is to focus on data structures (properties, strengths and tradeoffs) and techniques. This has been liberating so far but is a lot of work which drove me to look for resources adopting such a perspective and I found none. I believe its probably a lot of work (like you mention) but I wouldn&#x27;t know unless I get through more problems. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
