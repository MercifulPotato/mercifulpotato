My scraper wrapping the tool automates most of the task and only keeps the manual task, reducing the amount of required clicks (and time) required to get the task done.<p>I use a mix of headless browsers (for JS-heavy apps) and raw API calls. Sometimes I even use the browser to login, trigger a single sample APi call, extract all headers and content, close the browser, and re-run that api call directly using a HTTP lib. The request body obviously gets modified on the user’s requirements. We’re bypassing the slow login process as long as the session is valid. We’re also sharing sessions&#x2F;logins&#x2F;accounts this way without exposing credentials to users.<p>It can also be done to bypass the only-one-session-per-user systems. This is done with permission from 3rd parties. They’re fine with it, they just didn’t want to provide a proper API or let us bypass the only-one-session rule because it requires code changes they’re not willing to make only for us.<p>Sometimes the tool breaks when the html\nOr api changes but it usually only takes a few minutes to modify the code to fix it.')
