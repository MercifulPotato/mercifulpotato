Doesn&#x27;t being free from having to carry an extra dongle around feel good?<p>I don&#x27;t insist it (a USB-A port) should be there but I would be pleased to have one. Its lack would mean I would have to always carry a dongle with me. Why not build it in if you always carry it with you anyway?<p>&gt; Plus it would keep the machine smaller (the physical height is an issue with the cases).<p>Some extra millimetres are exactly the thing I absolutely couldn&#x27;t care less about. Completely irrelevant. Definitely not willing to sacrifice, let alone pay anything for this.')
