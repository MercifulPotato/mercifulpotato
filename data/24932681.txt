It&#x27;s also about providing a framework in which crime is avoided by <i>all</i> because they know there are repercussions they can&#x27;t avoid.<p>When the expectation is that you&#x27;re rich and you can get away with killing someone either through paying someone to take the fall or bribery, then that will happen more often.  If the expectation is that everyone is equal under the law, that will happen less.<p>The US isn&#x27;t perfect in this regard, but I think it&#x27;s a lot better than what&#x27;s being described here.  If Ivanka Trump drove recklessly and killed someone, it would be a lot harder for it to play out the same way here.  That&#x27;s not to say she would necessarily face justice, just that it&#x27;s a lot harder to get out of it, so there wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be an <i>expectation</i> that it will go away.  There&#x27;s a huge difference in expecting to get away with something and knowing it&#x27;s uncertain when the consequences are years in prison.')
