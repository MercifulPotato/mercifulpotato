But I can completely understand that it&#x27;s not great for the majority of users.<p>Stable is <i>too</i> stable for the average desktop user - often kernel is missing drivers for newer hardware models, or system libraries are too old for newer applications.<p>Testing works <i>most of the time</i> but is not stable enough. Most recent example; zfs, which is on 0.8.x, is completely broken in testing since the kernel upgrade to 5.10 in December. zfs has not (and prob will not) backported 5.10 compatibility to 0.8.x. Last I heard, the Debian maintainers were still not decided on if they are going to backport the 5.10 fix to their own fork of zfs 0.8.x, or if they&#x27;re going to do the upgrade to zfs 2.0 already.<p>I had a couple of servers where I had stupidly enabled unattended-upgrades, which broke the filesystems and required recovery to make services start again. Annoying, but it was my mistake.<p>This kind of situation is completely expected and there&#x27;s really no one at fault. But it is a good example of why vanilla Debian is not suitable for many users and use-cases. Mint does seem like a better Ubuntu, though.')
