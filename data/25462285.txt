Furthermore, most visitors to Amazon have no idea that their products are being fulfilled by different people and not by Amazon. They think that Amazon has a warehouse for 100% of the products they sell on their site, and these other sellers are non-obvious to the vast majority of users. When they see things related to &quot;sellers&quot; on a product page, they just think that means the manufacturer. They don&#x27;t get that any scammer can &quot;open a store&quot; on Amazon because Amazon goes to great lengths to make the experience seem like it&#x27;s all 1 big store. Sure there are weasel words all over the site that point out that Amazon is only an intermediary, but almost no non-technical user understands this. Thus, leaving bad seller feedback anywhere other than the product page allows Amazon to keep scamming users through these 3rd party sellers.')
