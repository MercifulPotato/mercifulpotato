Thankfully it was in clinical psych (which from an observer&#x27;s point of view is the &quot;best&quot; of the psych programs) and she abandoned academia so she has a decent, well-paying job.<p>America mints way more liberal arts PhDs than we have jobs for. Being in debt w&#x2F;o a job at 30 is not a great position to be in.<p>Also, getting the degree (aka being a low-payed servant for her PI) wasn&#x27;t far from misery.
