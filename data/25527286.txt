Eventually, I got into it enough to go through all the memorization bits.<p>If piano sounds appealing to you, I recommend using software like Synthesia to make the first few months as easy as possible, to get excited about it.<p>I have the impression that many people learning instruments, and sadly also many teachers, take an approach that kills motivation.\nIt seems to me that very few people want to become professionals, and that most just want to be able to play a few songs and have fun.
