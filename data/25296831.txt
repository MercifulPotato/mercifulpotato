As a PhD student I&#x27;ve already had a (strong) disagreement with my thesis advisor about whether to submit a paper or not. My advisor thought I shouldn&#x27;t, I thought I should. In the end, I submitted it and it got rejected and that&#x27;s where the whole affair stopped.<p>Actually, I really can&#x27;t think of how my advisor would tell me not to publish a paper, except to suggest that it&#x27;s not ready for publication.<p>But perhaps, as is often the case in these conversations, we&#x27;re talking about different &quot;academia&quot;&#x27;s? I think there are differences between fields and between different countries&#x27; institutions in the same field etc.')
