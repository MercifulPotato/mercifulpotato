They clog up cities like Berlin and take more and more space. They&#x27;re also completely useless as no one actually needs a 4x4 or extra-elevated car, it&#x27;s pure marketing and ego stroking.<p>Japanese cities and places like Okinawa use public space so much more efficiently, you see tiny cars and Microvans everywhere. For urban settings they&#x27;re really the perfect choice of vehicle IMHO, so it&#x27;s quite sad you can&#x27;t buy them here.')
