This strawman is presented every time this topic comes up. It&#x27;s not about the quality of the Post&#x27;s journalism. It&#x27;s about whether Twitter should restrict it.<p>Twitter is a private company. They constantly, if unevenly, exercise their right to ban hate speech and what causes it.<p>&gt; But it is a newspaper. A newspaper with a better reputation for reporting the news than Twitter.<p>Twitter is not a newspaper. Or a news organization. It&#x27;s a social network.<p>&gt; But people on HN try to falsely characterize it as the equivalent of the National Enquirer.<p>That&#x27;s debatable. You admit it&#x27;s a rag, that publishes some of the lowest quality journalism. It&#x27;s also very politically biased, in a way that damages the very fabric of society. Restricting its reach is the responsible thing to do in their case.<p>As for the National Enquirer, nobody takes them seriously or call it a legitimate newspaper. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to hold the NY Post to a higher standard.')
