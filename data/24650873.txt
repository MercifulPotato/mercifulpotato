It&#x27;s true, you currently need to be careful when buying cables, but if you are, you can charge all your devices with the same plug. And usb-c video means your monitor can act as usb hub for keyboard and mouse over the video cable, so you only need to replug a single cable to move video and mouse and keyboard between computers. I use this a lot with my laptops, I find it super convenient. It&#x27;s not like the previous situation was easier to navigate for consumers. Sure, I&#x27;d be nice if usb-c was an even bigger improvement, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be called &quot;total mess&quot;.')
