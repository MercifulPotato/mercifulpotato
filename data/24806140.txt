They merely want it to be.<p>Saying &quot;thank you&quot; and giving credit to someone who did you a solid is pretty universally a norm.<p>&gt; If you have a good number of people disagreeing on it, take it as a humble suggestion that norms differ across geos, industries, culture, etc.<p>Or, there&#x27;s just the fraction of people who disregard and push back on norms.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t find a need to credit Claude Shannon, John Von Neumann, Tony Hoare, etc in all our products. I find this to be OK.<p>It&#x27;s a bit different here, in that the people you cite are titans who developed ideas that might be a portion of a work... which is a bit different from using the work wholesale.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would expect Amazon to thank&#x2F;cite&#x2F;acknowledge something they used that comprised 1% of a product... but when it reaches a very high proportion it&#x27;s time to mention it.<p>Further, these were academics.  We <i>do</i> have a norm of citing them when we&#x27;re deeply using and building upon their work academically.')
