In subjective areas where we rely on a sense of &quot;taste&quot; , this multiplicity is often inherent.<p>Preference is much easier to map to your actions, but does not imply you think it&#x27;s the only way.  To go back to the analogy, I can think the other form is equally interesting, but realize I haven&#x27;t spent enough time on it to really differentiate things at the level I can with my preferred form.  There is no question where my preference lies, but that does not imply I think it&#x27;s a superior form.  Presumably if I thought it was an inferior form, I might change preference.')
