We are talking the difference between living in a shared accommodation and maybe having a small apartment, maybe having a used car, etc.<p>Plenty of students get bankrolled by a combination of scholarships, their parents, and loans, and have for decades.  There’s nothing wrong with it (or with going the frugal route either).<p>Edit:  \nTo live in dorm 25 years ago in a standard Canadian university (for me) it cost $500&#x2F;month plus another $500 a month in mandatory food card.  That’s equivalent to 650 euros.  That’s plus utilities, off campus food and drink, computer, recreation, and transportation, probably another 100-150 euros.
