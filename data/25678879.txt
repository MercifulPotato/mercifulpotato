They are part of the development build tools which gets stripped out. You can run a single build command on your laptop and SCP the result.<p>&gt; In fact every dependency was manually downloaded and put on a vendored folder of the project. It was added as a dependency by adding a HTML tag.<p>You can lock the dependency versions so your production code would have the same code.<p>You can commit node modules along with your code.<p>You could use zero installs by yarn which compresses node modules to make it easier to push them to version control.<p>Why manual?')
