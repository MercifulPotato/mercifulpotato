I&#x27;m not at that level but I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m not talking about spending hours studying openings, but simply being able to name things is helpful. That way you can pick new ideas along the way, memorize past mistakes more easily, communicate with other players. And it doesn&#x27;t take much time to know the first few moves of the most common openings.')
