Further, real world engines have limited RPM ranges which generally don’t damage freely spinning tires.<p>So, while such simple differentials can get stuck fairly easily, they also work surprisingly well.  The obvious trick is to apply some breaking power to the spinning wheel to then apply force to the stuck one, thus <i>traction control.</i> Or to just lock a differential when bouldering etc.  More complicated mechanical systems can always provide some power to both wheels, but they aren’t actually necessary.')
