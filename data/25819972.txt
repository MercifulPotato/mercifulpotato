Quite the opposite. Also, having a diet that isn&#x27;t varied is a way to naturally regulate hunger&#x2F;ghrelin.<p>I know we don&#x27;t want to commit the naturalistic fallacy or anything like it, but it does give me pause given how little we know about the microbiome. Presumably, in human evolutionary history, we coevolved with a microbiome that relied on a very homogeneous diet. What is the impact of suddenly having a diet with 50+ food types instead of 5? We already know that this sorta screws up our hunger regulation mechanism, but could there be other deleterious effects?<p>I easily accept that a whole foods diet is ideal, however.')
