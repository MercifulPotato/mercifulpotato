It doesn&#x27;t matter is a song is &quot;good&quot;, if spotify decides it&#x27;s the next hit it will become one. &amp;c.<p>It&#x27;s like TV or radio on steroids, everyone listen to the same thing, read the same articles, watch the same netflix shows. Anecdata: a lot of my friends started to play chess seemingly out of nowhere, I really didn&#x27;t get it until I learned there was a new netflix show about chess that made the game hype again')
