Taubes is not discussing, for example, the difference between healthy and unhealthy obesity and the role that dysfunctional adipogenesis plays in the latter by inducing hypertrophic changes in fat cells (distended fat cells) rather than hyperplasia (create more fat cells).<p>A lot of research has focused on finding agonists for PPARgamma to restore healthy adipogenesis and reduce unhealthy inflammation of fat tissue.  Some have been taken off the market for suspected toxicities, but piaglitazone is still widely prescribed.')
