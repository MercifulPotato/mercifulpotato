Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611267415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864897, text='&gt; This is funny (as in, LOL funny) to point out because it makes parler seem completely inept, but it’s only technically correct.<p>This is one of the cases where technically correct <i>is actually</i> the best kind of correct, because it goes directly to Parler’s claim that Twitter is a similar situated entity hosted on AWS being treated differently.<p>&gt; They just negotiated a fat contract to host twitter, and that’s set to go live in the next few months. Can that really not be considered an endorsement of twitter’s content with respect to AWS’ ToS?<p>Um, no?<p>(1) Because if Twitter is under the standard TOS, they’ll be subject to the same reactive enforcement and quick cancellation as anyone else. Bringing someone on on those terms simply means you have the same trust as you’d extend to a random member of the public that they won’t break your TOS.<p>(2) Since they just “negotiated a fat contract”, they may or may not even be under the same TOS as are offered to people who just want to pick up hosting without negotiation. Which would be even farther from an endorsement of their content adhering to the general TOS.<p>&gt; I do think that parler can make an interesting case about AWS picking a winner and damaging a loser.<p>Its possible that they could do so in the abstract, but they <i>have</i> made an argument along those lines, and its pretty clear that that concrete argument, as opposed to any hypothetical one they could have made, was, in the context of the particular evidence they’ve profferred to support it, unconvincing to the judge.')
