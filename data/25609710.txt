PEX has much lower pressure ratings than metal.  I plan to use PEX for a water purification system, but it will be sub 100 PSI.  Most PEX-A are rated to 200 PSI at room temp and 120-150 PSI at 180 degrees F. They will rupture at 400 to 800 PSI of water depending on the brand.  Metal pipes can handle thousands of PSI, required for pushing water through membranes.')
