It&#x27;s probably more likely to crash immediately <i>in practice</i>, but it&#x27;s also easier for an optimizer to &quot;see through&quot;, so you may get surprising optimizations if you get it wrong.<p>Honestly, unless you <i>really</i> cannot afford it time-budget wise, I would just ship everything with ASAN, UBSAN, etc. and deal with the crash reports.')
