His reputation would definitely never be the same. The fact he didn&#x27;t spend time in prison might be a good thing. I recall seeing a horrifying doco about a guy in prison who stabbed another inmate like 100 times and killed him. The stabber was already doing life in jail for murder. But his partner who helped him by holding that inmate down is a guy who ended up in prison for a minor fraud of a check or something along those lines. The fact they mix those people in prison is crazy (that was a pretty old case, maybe today things are different).')
