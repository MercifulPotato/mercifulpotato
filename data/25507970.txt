I have a friend that started a year ahead of me who was a &quot;turn back&quot; for an honor violation. The violation was in her first year and they decided she was still adapting to the honor code when it happened. The result was 5 years at West Point where she had an in between rank of Cadet PFC for her second year.<p>The idea of zero tolerance is a little crazy. Have you ever violated a software license, or streamed something with someone else&#x27;s account? Those should technically be honor violations, but they aren&#x27;t prosecuting those. It isn&#x27;t 100% clear to me where to draw the line.')
