No one would even care if the Hunter Biden related emails passed DKIM except for the widespread allegation that they were fake, and no one still cares because conversation about them passing DKIM is widely suppressed (including on HN, unfortunately, where a post about it was immediately flagged).  Oh well, I suppose it&#x27;s like when the ACLU used to defend awful speech for the sake of defending free speech because those were the cases available which could make an impact.<p>Unfortunately publishing DKIM secret keys only goes so far towards avoiding accidental non-repudiation:  Recipients can cryptographically timestamp the signatures before the keys are published. ... and doing so already makes sense independent of DKIM.  In fact, one of the ways that the public was able to prove that the outdated google DKIM key was a real key was that we were able to find cryptographically timestampped google signed emails from back when that key was still in use.<p>Better than key publication is to avoid having a non-repudiateable    stamp to begin with. This is much easier in the context of end-to-end two-party interactive protocols, but I believe is still possible for multiparty protocols.<p>The analog for DKIM wouldn&#x27;t work so well unfortunately, because DKIM isn&#x27;t end to end.  E.g. DKIM could be changed so that the signature demonstrated that either the sending server or the recipient server signed the message-- this would be just as good for anti-spam, but really wouldn&#x27;t improve the non-repudiation in most cases. Contrast that with applying the same approach to end-to-end messaging, where it gives you pretty strong non-repudiation.')
