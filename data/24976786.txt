While in charge of sanitation on the Panama Canal project, Dr William Gorgas discovered which varieties of mosquito spread both malaria and yellow fever, worked out their life cycle and reproductive habits, figured out how far they would fly, etc.<p>He figured out that malaria is spread by mosquitoes that live in human settlements and lay their eggs in clean stagnant water, so he created a workforce that did nothing but police the towns and villages for stagnant water where these mosquitoes could breed. They installed running water in both Panama City and Col√≥n so that nobody had to fetch water from wells and then store it in jugs.<p>Yellow fever on the other hand is spread by a mosquito that only lives in the jungle, and only lays it&#x27;s eggs in running water. They will only fly a few hundred feet in open air, so Gorgas&#x27;s workforce cut the jungle back far enough from the working and living areas of the canal that the mosquitoes couldn&#x27;t bite people. They also kept all the grass mowed throughout the zone, and put kerosene drips in all of the streams in the zone so that mosquitoes couldn&#x27;t breed there.<p>He also segregated hospital patients by illness, rather than by country of origin. When the French were running it, the hospital had been a breeding ground for disease because a mosquito could fly in and bite a man dying of yellow fever, then bite the man in the next bed over who had a broken bone. On the other hand you might not be able to converse with your neighbors while you were there. Everything is a trade-off.')
