(If that doesn&#x27;t do it, then it&#x27;s either just a logic bug, or you have a really strange bug in the first place!) The main issue people have with it is that its terminal interface is almost always unusable (you get thousands of lines of gibberish text), and there aren&#x27;t many good Valgrind GUI frontends available. Thankfully CLion has an integrated valgrind inspector that really helps a lot.')
