Every state gets two senators and because of that 2 bonus electoral college votes. That&#x27;s why Wyoming gets 3 times as many electoral college votes per person as California. Without the senate the electoral college is just a popular vote. The 3&#x2F;5 compromise doesn&#x27;t even exist anymore because slavery is now illegal.')
