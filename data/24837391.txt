But if you&#x27;re reliant on China and others for all of your manufactured goods including semi-conductors, you&#x27;re in for a world of pain, oceans or not.<p>Likewise, oil and gas aren&#x27;t all that helpful if you can&#x27;t get them out of the ground because your equipment is broken and all the replacement parts are made in China.<p>I say this as a patriotic American.
