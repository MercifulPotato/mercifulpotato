I know the syntax like the back of my hand, however i still struggle with organizing my code&#x2F;projects.<p>I have the following problems:<p>1.When i work with classes am not sure what should be a class on its own, and when to use inheritance. The examples available are pretty stupid e.g Animal -&gt; Dog etc.<p>2. I do not know when to create a new file, where should my code live? How should i structure it?<p>3. I seem to get confused by my own code after a couple of weeks when i look at it.<p>What would you guys recommend me to read&#x2F;learn? Am looking for some kind of pattern i can work with.<p>Thanks')
