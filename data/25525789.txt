Item(by='janniks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608796365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519536, text='That‘s a very good question! I am not sure how easy it is to do in a agnostic way. If we want to utilize the static generation features and other framework features, it‘s necessary to use some framework specific components (e.g. Next and Nuxt both have their own version of the „link“ that allows for smarter page loading after an initial render. It might be possible to just replace these parts somehow and leave the rest agnostic. But I don‘t think that‘s an easy task and you might lose some features when switching to a „dangerous setting inner html“ approach that isn‘t very well optimized in the compilation steps of the frameworks.\n Btw, I love your content!')
