I know, it doesn&#x27;t exist yet, but big tech and lefties are making it happen by changing the meaning of commonly used words in the dictionary.<p>As personal communication, Newspeak is to be spoken in staccato rhythm, using words that are short and easy to pronounce. The Party intends to make speech physically automatic and intellectually unconscious in order to diminish the possibility of critical thought occurring to the speaker. English words of comparative and superlative meanings and irregular spellings were simplified into regular spellings; thus, better becomes gooder and best becomes goodest. The prefixes plus- and doubleplus- are used for emphasis (for example, pluscold meaning &quot;very cold&quot; and doublepluscold meaning &quot;extremely cold&quot;). Adjectives are formed by adding the suffix –ful to a root-word, e.g. goodthinkful means &quot;Orthodox in thought.&quot;; while adverbs are formed by adding the suffix –wise, e.g. goodthinkwise means &quot;In an orthodox manner&quot;.')
