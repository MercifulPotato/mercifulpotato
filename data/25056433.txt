I suspect that this has something to do with gender politics, which most prominently falls within the sphere of the left wing, predominantly focusing on issues affecting women. It makes sense that if you&#x27;re tuned into spheres primarily amplifying issues impacting women, and not men, that you would assume that your own son&#x27;s issues aren&#x27;t necessarily representative of the population at large.<p>Over 60% of college graduates are women, and up until the age that many women choose to have a family (early 30s), women actually out-earn men. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with either of those things, but certain models in our collective understanding of society need to be more cognizant of these facts, among others. People that speak about the problems with the way we conceptualize gender issues, people like Warren Farrell, Karen Straughan, Janice Fiamengo, and Christina Hoff-Sommers, actually face an embarrassing amount of vitriol from institutions, when invited to speak on these topics.')
