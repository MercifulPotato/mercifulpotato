Item(by='wayneftw', descendants=None, kids=[25972930], score=None, time=1612034004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971393, text='&gt; But Ctrl+C to Copy is the broken part, so I do not want it! :) Ctrl+C is a signal to the running application inside the terminal, and should be passed without interference by the terminal emulator.<p>No, detecting when some text is selected and performing a copy instead of sending the signal is the correct way to do this in 2020.<p>If you don&#x27;t like that, every OS lets you remap keys.<p>&gt; If by that you mean &quot;doing things the reasonable way and not needing to offer workarounds for their failures&quot;, then we are in complete agreement. :)<p>I guess next you&#x27;ll be telling me that never implementing a real &quot;maximize&quot; feature for application windows in your OS is reasonable. :) (And no... Alt + click on the green button does not maximize every window.) As usual, with a Mac you have to continually work around Apple by using apps that will probably not work after a big update if you want to do anything out side of the &quot;Apple way&quot;.<p>&gt; I want OneModifierKeyButNotCtrl+C to Copy in all GUI applications including terminal emulators. I would settle for SomeModifierKeyCombinationNotCtrlAlone+C to Copy in all GUI applications including terminal emulators.<p>And you can absolutely have that in Windows or Linux [0]. That&#x27;s because both of them are <i>easily</i> orders of magnitude more flexible and have more options than any OS offered by Apple. Heck, I can&#x27;t even turn off that idiotic marketing tactic of old, the startup chime, in my old 2012 Mac Pro.<p>Anyway - whatever you think is correct about Ctr+C, there&#x27;s no denying that Macs are completely inflexible in many, many, many ways and the only reason you&#x27;re on one if you&#x27;ve got strong opinions is because your opinions happen to align with what Apple thinks. If your opinion differs at all, you&#x27;ll be the one bending. Enjoy that!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=change+copy+paste+shortcuts+linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=change+copy+paste+shortcuts+...</a>')
