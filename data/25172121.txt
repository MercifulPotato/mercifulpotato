They’re designed for:<p>- more accurately and more maintainably typing existing JS interfaces<p>- enabling more advanced compile time features for libraries<p>I’m probably one of these “typstronauts” you reference, I have extensively used nearly every advanced type feature in library code. But I’ve seldom found a need for any of them in consuming code. My approach since I adopted TS has always been:<p>- libraries can and should provide types at whatever level of complexity necessary to make library usage flexible, safe and simple<p>- end product code should use simple types wherever possible and depend as much as possible on the flexibility, safety and simplicity of the interfaces provided by those more complex libraries')
