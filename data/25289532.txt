This is very attractive in terms of cost.<p>As best I know they don&#x27;t have a GPU chiplet, and so they can&#x27;t just add one to a CPU. All their processors containing both CPU and GPU are designed like the M1 - one big chip with both.<p>Hopefully this will change soon, and we&#x27;ll have Navi 2&#x2F;3 chiplets going around.')
