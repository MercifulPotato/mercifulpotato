Married at 16. First kid at 18. Last child at 44. Grandma didn&#x27;t get a washing machine until 1970, if I recall. Had she not been there to take care of the kids and the farm, Grandpa couldn&#x27;t have worked at an industrial bakery from 4 a.m. to noon. Then from noon to around 3, he&#x27;d come home and sleep, then take over work in the fields until dusk.<p>Grandpa sold his body in manual labor, but Grandma was right beside him.<p>It kind of disgusts me that a lot of modern women look down on someone like my Grandma, who built a happy home, a beautiful family, and fostered literally nothing but warm and special memories for all her kids and grandkids.')
