Credit card vendors have flat fees that will eat up a whole transaction if it&#x27;s too small. For instance, strip has a flat 30c fee. This means the only reasonable way to do this is to have a user pre-pay a large sum and reduce from that, or to batch their transactions and extend them some credit. The former dissuades people from making a payment at all, and the latter runs the risk of bounced charges or users never purchasing enough to justify the charge.<p>2. There is no universal payments API. Browsers are starting to work on this with the w3c web payments standard <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;Payments&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;Payments&#x2F;</a> but this is just for user input. You still have to work with companies like Stripe or PayPal to then actually make the charge.<p>3. Dark patterns are more successful. You see this with a lot of game currencies. By forcing users into larger purchases, you can get them to justify spending more (e.g. bundling multiple items into one package, maybe with &quot;discounts&quot;) and if you sell your own currency, you can make the values not add up evenly so that the user has leftover balance that they perceive as being &quot;wasted&quot; unless they buy more.<p>I work on a web extension that provides a javascript API for making payments using the Bitcoin Lightning network: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightningjoule.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightningjoule.com&#x2F;</a>. I really love the possibilities that small payments open up, and have been working to smooth out the UX of having to confirm a payment every time: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@wbobeirne&#x2F;introducing-joule-allowances-2b08bec75e3a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@wbobeirne&#x2F;introducing-joule-allowances-2...</a>. However it&#x27;s still a long way from any mainstream adoption.')
