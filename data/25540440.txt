I do not know what this means. I was not part of any local assemblies as I am not German, nor do I speak German, and many of the assemblies at 35c3 seemed to be treating me very coldly as they are just local clubs from all over Germany. (Understandable, I do not fault them).<p>&gt;My only recommendation here is to fly into Berlin and take the hourly train down to Leipzig. It&#x27; somewhat cheaper to fly into and the train ride is a nice ride.<p>yes. I was looking into this, Do you have a recommendation for a good website to explore train timetables and routes? What I have to be careful about is timing because if I need to stay overnight in Berlin then it may increase the cost such that if it wastes a lot of time, then it may not be worth saving the additional plane money(as many flights have stops in some other city on the way to Leipzig anyway).<p>Thank you for the response!')
