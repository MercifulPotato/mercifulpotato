We know it causes an immune response. We don&#x27;t know if that stops you from catching it, and we don&#x27;t know if it stops you from being infectious. It tips the scales in that direction, and  all we really need is for it to be effective <i>enough</i> to drop R0 low enough that coupling it with reasonable restrictions makes the virus go away, which is why it&#x27;s worth pursuing, but that&#x27;s a different goal to ensuring you can&#x27;t catch it at all.')
