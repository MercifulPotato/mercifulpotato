I watched both Java and Go since they got released and Java really quickly went into the over-engineering and complexity camp long before generics. I worked as a consultant doing Java long before generics and the culture of over-engineering was already there. The language also really encourage it.<p>Go is an entirely different beast. The language, libraries and whole community is really worshipping simplicity in a way Java never did.<p>Just look around a bit at the standard library. There are pretty much no setters and getters. No inheritance hierarchy to speak of. Not even constructors most of the time.<p>It is not without reason that Go angers a lot of people that think they know how to do software. It breaks all the rules they have kept sacred, that they think all “real” programmers should follow.<p>Think about it this way. If Java is SLS assembled in a clean room never getting done, then Go is more like SpaceX assembling a rocket in open space with guy who normally weld water towers. It isn’t how it is supposed to be done but it works and they get shit done 20x faster.')
