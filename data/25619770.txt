But it tends to be more basic and not rely on weird tricks that deeper knowledge of the language will allow you to do.<p>My larger point is that the first attempt to solve any problem in code is going to suck, so you might as well suck in a different language that won&#x27;t ever have a chance of being deployed into prod.
