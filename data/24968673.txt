I didn&#x27;t hear many serious people saying that, though I did hear it from a few propagandist talking head types. I ignore those as a rule.<p>Trump is too egotistical to serve anyone but himself, and he&#x27;s too wild and unpredictable to be a reliable agent to anyone. The allegation was that Trump <i>accepted</i> help offered by Russian agents, which is likely as I&#x27;m sure he would have accepted help offered by anyone.<p>I just thought Russia may have covertly backed him in an attempt to get an intensely repellent and divisive candidate into office and damage America&#x27;s reputation. There&#x27;s a good deal of evidence that Russia is <i>still</i> in the ring for Trump, such as Russian state TV running anti-Biden stuff all day right now. There is also evidence for Russian propaganda targeting the Democrats and the left too, like sock puppets infiltrating BLM chat rooms and pushing the most divisive messages possible. The ultimate goal is destabilization and damage to America&#x27;s reputation, not the victory of any specific candidate.<p>That being said, I think the ultimate goal of this Russian propaganda may be more inward-facing than outward-facing. Putin needs to portray American democracy as a failure in order to hold onto power <i>in Russia</i>. Meddling in American and other democratic processes can be a way to do that.')
