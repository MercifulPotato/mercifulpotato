I don&#x27;t use any extensions that request this permission. My company even pushes a Chrome policy that outright blocks them.<p>Manifest v3 fixes this by taking away blanket &lt;all_urls&gt; permissions. This would break ad blockers, so they add declarativeWebRequest and remove the blocking webRequest API that would be useless anyway.')
