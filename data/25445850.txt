Brave also does additional work, liking inspecting the CNAME to see if the domain is an alias for a third-party, known tracker. One area where Brave is a little behind is in the aesthetic blocking, things like clearing elements off a page. We have that ability as well, but it&#x27;s not quite as mature and well-rounded as you would see in something like uBO. Our work is not complete :)')
