I think what we&#x27;re really touching upon here is that it starts to go against our belief that we are exceptionally special.  And of course we are -- we don&#x27;t really know any better.  But maybe it simply doesn&#x27;t matter and it would be good enough.  Think of it like going to sleep -- how do you really know, beyond theoretical doubt, that you&#x27;re still &quot;you&quot; when you wake up?<p>I&#x27;m simply here to provide a perspective perhaps not often considered.  More for sparking additional thinking on the subject than anything else.  I too believe we&#x27;re super duper special unique snowflakes ;)')
