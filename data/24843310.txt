It didnt replace a database, it used a decentralized database for a new purpose.<p>Other new ways of using blockchain have clearly not emerged, but I feel like the rollercoaster of popularity came from people completely misunderstanding how it added value to cryptocurrency and looking for the wrong kind of applications. Distributed tasks (bitcoin is uber for transaction verification) are where it&#x27;s at, not a database.')
