Item(by='simion314', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602937436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808040, text='GDPR is not about advertising, so you can put a billion ads if you want just don&#x27;t track me behind my back then share this data with 100+ companies so now they all know all y activity on the internet.<p>GDPR should not dictate how you implement ads, if you want targeted ads then maybe the industry needs to implement them respectfully, the user would opt=in, connect his browser with FB,Google,Twitter and then he will get targeted stuff. They could make a browser, DRM-it to shit and if you use that browser you get less ads but all of them are targeted and ever click in that browser is tracked, it would be an opt-in stuff where you sell your browsing activity for ad-points that you can spend on  different websites to read articles.<p>We need strong laws because the industry is fucking the users, they sell you products like a TV or an OS but they still want to make a few more cents so they continue to track you and sell your data to advertisers.<p>IMO advertising is mostly manipulation, make people buy expensive diamonds or expensive clothing or phones when they don&#x27;t have too, I would be curious if we could create a economy simulator and ban all advertising like it was done for cigarettes and see what happens.')
