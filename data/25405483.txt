But still, in practice, what&#x27;s left of SemWeb (on the web) is used for marking up HTML for search engines, in the form of meta-tags, Open Graph annotations, location data, RDFa, microformats, etc. The question is, should they, when Google will preview their data in search results such that they don&#x27;t get clicks? Which is exactly the problem with semantic technologies on the web.')
