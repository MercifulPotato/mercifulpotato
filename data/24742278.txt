Those have now reached ridiculous levels of technological sophistication. They&#x27;re light, powerful, indestructible, and can carry any load you plug into them. And in a blind test with good speakers they will sound better than anything &quot;high end&quot;. Oh and they&#x27;re almost always under $1K, with brownout inducing 2KW+ units below $2K.<p>If it&#x27;s high fidelity sound reproduction you&#x27;re after (rather than just &quot;pleasant&quot; coloration), today&#x27;s upscale studio and live gear can&#x27;t be beat IMO.')
