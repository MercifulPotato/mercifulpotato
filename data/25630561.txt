The comment about the AI researcher that was allegedly fired for being &quot;critical&quot; hints at the latter.<p>While a union that represents workers interests is a good thing, I think it would be dangerous to give even a part of google to people with ideological fervor. If, for instance, this group actually wants to and succeeds in turning google into a tool of the cancel culture, things will get ugly soon.<p>Now that leaves me wondering if it is wise to leave this comment here...<p>edit:<p>Just an example from the mission statement:<p>&gt; We will prioritize the needs of the worst off. Neutrality never helps the victim.<p>What this means is, not all google workers will be treated equally by this union. &quot;Victims&quot;, i.e., persons will be ordered by their &quot;oppression status&quot; and gain preferential treatment. Now it will probably be fun to watch the details in this valuation process (e.g., &quot;is a woman more victim than a black (disabled) male?&quot;), but this inherent categorization of human beings into more and less worth is ugly as hell.')
