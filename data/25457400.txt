There is a literal system in the US equities space that says what the best price for a symbol is across the exchanges.<p>The internalizer can arbitrage this system due to physics &amp; CAP there on but they can also do it in more prosaic ways, by having previous inventory that is priced better or by simply taking the spread between an internal netting (thus internalizing it).<p>In any case it’s Robinhood who holds the fiduciary duty not the internalizer so if they aren’t getting appropriate execution they need to change their contracts with the internalizers, switch to a different set or send directly to lit exchanges (which destroys their business model &amp; likely gives worse execution than a more fair internalization setup would).')
