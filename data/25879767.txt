I don&#x27;t think expressing concern that the hype over hydroxychloroquine is misguided and wasting resources equates to an assumption that all drug research is futile on their part.<p>Indeed, it seems like many drugs have received research attention (I did one quick search that turned up over 3000 trials registered this year for various treatments, though many might have been duplicates or meta analysis or not approved). I have limited time and interest in researching Ivermectin specifically, but, as I see oft quoted here, the plural of anecdote is not data. My understanding is that Remdesivir is currently the best treatment option, is approved by the FDA for use, and was a repurposed drug developed against other viruses.<p>Thanks for the link to BMJ. If that turns out to be true, it would be disappointing to me (relative to 90%). But also still seems to show a reduction in severity, which is good for all of us. Thus also an increased importance that everyone who can gets vaccinated, for their own health (if we learn that you can&#x27;t depend on herd immunity to protect you) and continued exploration of improved treatments.')
