There&#x27;s a premium to be someone (and a nation of someones) who can deal with harsh realities and crush through adversity. Every society that got to &quot;the top&quot; got there because of this, and I suspect every society that declined did so because of overindulgence in decadence and weakness. We don&#x27;t want that.')
