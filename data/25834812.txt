What I have been using is VScode with some scripts and other features. Really want an alternative to scrivener that keeps everything in markdown.<p>The key thing I miss in all the other versions is something that will:<p>1. Count the words in a chapter&#x2F;scene&#x2F;section<p>2. Give me a total based on the &quot;in work&quot; chapters&#x2F;scenes&#x2F;sections<p>For example suppose I am writing Chapter 1-9. I don&#x27;t like Chapter 8 so I am rewriting an alternate. I want to know what the old chapter 8 word count is, what the new one is, and what the total word count is (and I can select which chapters or sections to include in the &quot;total&quot;).<p>Looks like this does something like that so long as I put all the relevant chapters together in the same folder. (Good enough if I get to use Markdown.)<p>Only issue is, if I go into the folders, I don&#x27;t see the Markdown files. Isn&#x27;t that the point?')
