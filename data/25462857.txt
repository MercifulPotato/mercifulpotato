This is quite common. Sirlin assumed a sort of community knowledge as to the context that people who came across the series later tend to lack.<p>Playing To Win is about people who refuse to learn the rules of a game. That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening here. What&#x27;s happening here is that people who understand the rules very well are pointing out that they have holes in them.<p>Scrub statement: &quot;throws are cheap&quot;. Informed statement: &quot;the way SF2 tick throw setups work biases the gameplay too far in favor of the player with offensive agency.&quot; You&#x27;ll note that the latter makes no mistake about the purpose of the rules and makes no judgments about players using the tools provided. Instead it focuses on system interactions and their net result. You&#x27;ll note that almost every big fighting game in the 20 years since the end of the SF2 series has reduced the power of tick throws by means of frame data or broader system changes. Players generally decided that getting the first knockdown should not have <i>that</i> much influence over a match.<p>Scrub statement: &quot;I hate people who get upset at review purchasing.&quot; Informed statement: &quot;Review purchasing makes the buying process worse for everyone by creating incentives to deceive buyers, increasing costs for sellers that purchase reviews and reducing sales to sellers who do not. It shifts the Nash equilibrium towards paying more for lower-quality products.&quot; Again, the latter examines the system interactions and emergent behavior rather than making moral judgments about the participants.')
