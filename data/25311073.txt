(Sorry if I misunderstood your original post.)<p>Yes, agree that maybe <i>some</i> vegans would go back to eating meat if it was lab-grown. But my guess is that <i>most</i> vegans (anecdotal going from the ones that I know) would not eat lab-grown meat, just like people in general probably wouldn&#x27;t eat lab-grown human meat. I mean, if human meat is &#x27;no-go&#x27;, why would animal meat be ok?<p>This is all from the perspective of being vegan for ethical reasons. If someone is vegan <i>only</i> for health or environmental reasons, then maybe they won&#x27;t care so much. But my experience is that people that go vegan for health&#x2F;environment quickly change to be more ethically focused.<p>&gt; Cells taken from “source” chickens are cultured in a laboratory<p>And then there is also the discussion whether lab-grown meat actually resolves the ethical issues. I mean, in order to grow the meat the lab has to initially source some cells from animals. Any vegan for ethical reasons would oppose that.')
