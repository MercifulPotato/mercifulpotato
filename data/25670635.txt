This is like 9&#x2F;11 with a four year warning of the planes arriving and being able to watch them on Flightradar, towing a huge sign saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to crash this baby into the Pentagon&quot;. And nobody doing anything about it because that would mean that &quot;both sides&quot; weren&#x27;t in fact equal.<p>Pleasantly surprised that the death toll was only four, of which only one was shot; much better than the regular death toll of single mass shooter incidents.')
