There were a few backward incompatible changes with modularisation (in order to break module cycles) but the bigger disruptive changes were moves away from sun.misc.* packages which should never have been used by production code (but which often were, because speed).<p>Fortunately Java took a middle-of-the-road approach; it didn&#x27;t quite get rid of as many things as it could (Unsafe stayed around in a few ways). Had it all been killed off then the transition would have been more problematic.<p>With Java 17 being the next LTS I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s appetite to break things before then but it&#x27;s quite possible that Java 18 will really put the hammer down and remove Unsafe for good. That, I think, will be one of the last disruptive things Java does.')
