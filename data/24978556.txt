I got them from Tanenbaums site <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electoral-vote.com&#x2F;evp2020&#x2F;Pres&#x2F;Graphs&#x2F;all.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electoral-vote.com&#x2F;evp2020&#x2F;Pres&#x2F;Graphs&#x2F;all.html</a> and this shows that Trump would win all swing states and thus the election, if there was not the surprising swing in Texas from Rep to Dem lately, which broke Trump. You cannot really trust Tanenbaums summary as heavy Dem fanboy, which was wrong last time and is wrong this time, but the raw polling numbers are showing a clear picture. Early votes missed the Hunter Biden scandal, and Texas was champion in early votes.')
