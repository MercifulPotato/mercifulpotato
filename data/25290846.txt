Normal banks make money on interchange on bank cards and interest spread (as well as less savory activities like crazy overdraft fees). Is there any revenue split with the partner? E.g., maybe Goldman pays 0.82%, I offer my customer 0.50%, and so I pocket 0.32% of the balance.<p>Second, what about customer service for the end customer? There&#x27;s clearly a top-level layer that&#x27;s managed by the partner, a mid-level layer managed by Stripe, and the deep backend banking layer managed by the partner bank. How is customer support split up among those 3?<p>Those were my two main questions. I heard a couple of people asking about use cases. My use case would be an idea I&#x27;ve been kicking around for a while. I&#x27;ve been working on a concept for a next-level-totally-awesome personal finance budget app. The fundamental purpose of a personal budgeting app is to assist you in knowing when to say yes, and when to say no to a purchase, and to do autopsies on past purchases that may have messed things up. I tried a basic version using Plaid to get a data feed from my bank, but the Plaid data feed is inconsistent from bank to bank (with how it handles authorizations that later settle or fail to settle). Being able to bundle a budget app directly with banking could be killer. You&#x27;d have real-time, 100% accurate data coming in. That would be a game changer that might make me finally finish my dusty app.<p>So, Tara, if you&#x27;re not doing revenue sharing with partners yet, please consider it:-). Revenue sharing is a great way to make apps-on-top-of-platforms flourish.')
