Great to see it here! I have worked with the PlaceKeys (n) a bit already and it is amazing to have a standard that is decipherable. Rather than some long string of characters that seemingly have no rhyme or reason, it is nice to have a code that stands for something on the user end! The native inclusion of batch processing made the work flow much much faster as well! Looking forward to the event on October 7th!')
