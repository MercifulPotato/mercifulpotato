Being able to create a free Discord server is great, and it is incredibly capable for most communities that don&#x27;t need the fancy perks of Discord Nitro etc.<p>&gt; The free Discord plan provides virtually all the core functionality of the platform with very few limitations. Free users get unlimited message history, screen sharing, unlimited server storage, up to eight users in a video call, and as many as 5,000 concurrent (i.e., online at the same time) users.<p>For a lot of small communities that aren&#x27;t focused around commerce of any kind, Discord&#x27;s free offering blows Element Matrix Services out the water. It&#x27;s a non starter. If I could create a server with feature parity to Discord&#x27;s free server, any new community I&#x27;d create I would definitely jump on EMS in a heartbeat, and I&#x27;d start trying to recreate communities currently within Discord, to be on EMS.<p>So like a very normal progression for Discord servers is that some niche sub-community wants to gather, and so they create a free server, and people join and there&#x27;s all kinds of rich content that gets posted and curated and great discussions and then as it gets bigger, people running the community or people who want to support the community will boost the server with Discord Nitro for additional features like more slots for custom emojis (I can&#x27;t communicate enough how important of a feature this is to Discord&#x27;s success, even though it seems like minor window dressing).<p>That kind of model is what would justify a server starting to shell out money every month for EMS. I would note that Discord&#x27;s pricing for this kind of level of community is tiered and not a per-user thing. You unlock more features based on how many users are paying for Nitro, going up a tier based on breakpoints of 2&#x2F;15&#x2F;30 Nitro Boosts per month. It doesn&#x27;t cost more to have a tier 3 server if you gain more users. This is a big deal for fostering growth and unseating incumbent social networks (which is what Discord and Slack are).<p>Just some thoughts. I really want stuff like Element&#x2F;Matrix to succeed!')
