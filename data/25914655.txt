The difference is neglible if you ask me, and 5 years isn&#x27;t that long anyway. The fees depend on the ETF you buy - in Europe, the difference between ETFs tracking All-World and Developed is around 0.08%. The biggest difference is that the Developed index &quot;only&quot; has 2000 stocks instead of the 4000 of All-World.<p>Another issue in Europe is that the accumulating ETFs (more tax efficient in most countries) tracking the Developed index have low liquidity.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.ftserussell.com&#x2F;Analytics&#x2F;Factsheets&#x2F;Home&#x2F;DownloadSingleIssue?issueName=AWD&amp;IsManual=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.ftserussell.com&#x2F;Analytics&#x2F;Factsheets&#x2F;Home&#x2F;D...</a>')
