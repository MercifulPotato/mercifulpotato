But it&#x27;s nice knowing it&#x27;ll someday end, otherwise I&#x27;d seek out some middle-ground (e.g. co-working space). I can&#x27;t see myself ever enjoying full-remote or full-office permanently. I&#x27;d love to work at the office 2 or 3 days a week. Without the commute, the mandatory grooming to be presentable, and the eating and such I do at home during reading &#x2F; passive meetings etc, I feel there&#x27;s a bit more time left and I have more energy to be extraverted with my people of choice after work. Rather than be forced 5 days a week to socially interact with people I happen to work with, and be drained after I get home. I like office friends, just not 5 days a week.<p>4) Listed main pros above. Cons are that I feel I was part of a company more, spoke to way more people than I worked with directly, at the office. Those relationships continue WFH, but not for long. If I&#x27;d started at a new job from home, I&#x27;d miss out on a lot of contacts, both social and professional. Another pro is that I find myself exercising more and destressing more at home. Few of us can be productive for 8 hours. So we&#x27;re often productive 5 hours. Then spend 3 hours talking, getting coffee, browsing the news, sending a friend a quick meme on our phone. At the office however a lot of that time is kind of wasted, it&#x27;s &#x27;fast food&#x27; content. Whereas at home, sometimes I take a 45 minute lunch break, grab some food from the fridge and watch a nice episode of a detective. Then get back to work. My unproductive time is more valuable and purposeful, less aimless.<p>5) No, in hindsight it was easy to see Covid-19 lasting all year. We kind of all said it. But there were also various signals that said otherwise. Some countries got a hold on it and opened up after. Other countries had successive lockdown&#x2F;open-up waves, the situation kept normalising to some extent. But if I knew what I know now (western-europe would begin the pandemic in lockdown and end the year in lockdown), and my manager did too, I could&#x27;ve made the case to move to another country and WFH. I&#x27;d rather have been stuck in say Taiwan or China as of the summer, than Europe. Way cheaper, way more fun, way safer, and just generally a nice adventure. Time zones would&#x27;ve been a challenge. But no, I stayed home (western-europe). I&#x27;d have way more energy working from home, knowing at 5-6PM I could head out to a nice restaurant, get some drinks, go to a comedy club, visit the museum next evening... than just being stuck at home all evening and working the next day.<p>6) Yes I recommend it, but we still have a long way to go culture-wise. I&#x27;d hate to WFH in a company that doesn&#x27;t actively facilitate it. Most companies got a big cultural headstart this year, but we&#x27;re not there yet.')
