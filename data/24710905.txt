Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602093776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709545, text='I always understood Firewire to be a standard designed for <i>complementary</i> use-cases to USB. Firewire isn&#x27;t an <i>attempt at</i> &quot;USB but better&quot; (though devices could theoretically be made to use it that way); it&#x27;s an attempt at &quot;powered SCSI, but smaller and more ruggedized.&quot; It&#x27;s a professional-equipment port, designed—on the one hand—for devices like laptops that can&#x27;t fit the older, full-scale professional-equipment port (like SAS or mini-XLR); and on the other hand, for manufacturers of high-BOM high-margin professional equipment, as an <i>extra</i> port they can slap onto their device to allow these portable devices to connect to them.<p>In that sense, Firewire is less analogous to a Lambo (&quot;a better car&quot;), and more akin to a truck. But a very tiny truck, designed for both off-roading and portability. Which is to say: an ATV.<p>An ATV isn&#x27;t better at being <i>a car</i> than a car is, but it is better at being <i>a truck</i> than a car is (though worse at being a truck than <i>a truck</i> is.) But sometimes, especially in constrained environments (e.g. search-and-rescue in the Alaskan wilderness), a truck won&#x27;t fit, and a car won&#x27;t work. So you <i>need</i> an ATV. It&#x27;s <i>well</i>-engineered for that particular set of constraints.<p>Which is also the deal with Thunderbolt: it&#x27;s PCI-e, but smaller and ruggedized, for places PCI-e itself wouldn&#x27;t work (like a laptop), but where you nevertheless still need PCI-e -alike performance and bus semantics.')
