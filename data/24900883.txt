It seems like agencies like the DHS and CBP have all the power (backed by the president, who seems to have complete and ultimate power), and all Congress has the power to do (or perhaps, doesn&#x27;t care to exercise any power it may have) is draft letters and launch investigations that have no real repercussions for those responsible for abuses. It would make me really happy if someone provides links to cases where the opposite was true - where Congress successfully exercised power over DHS, CBP, ETC.')
