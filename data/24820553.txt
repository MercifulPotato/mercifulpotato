Hyliion, OpenDoor &amp; Virgin Galactic come to mind. If you haven&#x27;t heard of HYLN, check it out. It&#x27;s currently in a massive dip due to many people cashing their early SPAC price + many people associating Nikola with HYLN because they&#x27;re both in the EV truck industry, but HYLN has actually amazing tech, great founder and I&#x27;ve talked to many truckers who cannot wait to retrofit the new engine in their old truck.')
