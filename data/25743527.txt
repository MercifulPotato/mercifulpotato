It’s not mutually exclusive, you can have a corporate job and run a gig&#x2F;startup on the side, it is possible with some tradeoffs. Over time, I actually prefer this approach over going all in at first. It let’s you earn money, gradually build&#x2F;develop your idea( something I’m doing now). I find I’m also a bit more conscious now of optimizing my time and willing to delegate, pay for stuff to be done.<p>Regarding interviews, most tech role interviews tend to focus on looking for specialists vs generalists, this has stung me quite a bit. I’d say to favor this in early on when searching, and be very upfront with interviewers in breadth value depth of knowledge')
