They don&#x27;t realize that they are the ones adding value to Apple&#x27;s platform, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to pay Apple to do so! With its app store, Apple acts like a corrupt bureaucrat middleman between developers and users, and demands an unnecessary bribe from both to distribute and use the app. It reduces profit for the developers and increases cost for their clients.')
