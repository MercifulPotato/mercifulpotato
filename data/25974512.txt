We don&#x27;t want to go into specifics, but suffice it to say that it&#x27;s not related to WallStreet Bets or anything like that, but instead is the sort of thing that causes you to get locked up for life.<p>We spent today doing an audit by revisiting recent issues reported to abuse@matrix.org, which had already identified and acted on the content in question.  We also took the opportunity to explain how Element and Matrix fit together, what decentralisation is, and the steps we take to mitigate abuse on the servers we run.<p>As a result, it looks like the app has just been reinstated while I was typing this message: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=im.vector.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=im.vector.app</a>.<p>Thanks everyone for your patience and support while we sorted this out (and huge thanks to the overall Element team who spent their Saturdays on the audit).')
