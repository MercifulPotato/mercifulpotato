No, if anything the original xpath was pretty well positioned to be consumed and used by non-programmers. The current, not so much.<p>The current xpath&#x2F;xquery language is poorly supported, mostly ignored and <i>incredibly</i> over engineered to the point where it’s almost comically unfit for purpose. Sorry.<p>&gt; XML is one of the most misunderstood technologies in our industry<p>It’s pretty well understood and has valid use cases. However it had a history of overly complex, over engineered tooling created by a committee and stuffed full of acronyms.<p>This quite rightly puts people off, and there are just better formats and technologies to use that isn’t encumbered with XML baggage.')
