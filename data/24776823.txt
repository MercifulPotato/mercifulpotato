Guzzle had this, where you could set a Proxy request header and all the curl requests would try to use the address you sent for it&#x27;s calls.<p>Any header the user can set is always suspect.<p>We &#x27;use&#x27; it when the ALB sets it for real-client-ip in nginx (while understanding that if something looks weird we should look at the full header). However a better solution is if your edge service sets (and protects, that&#x27;s important) a header with the client IP to use that.<p>Cloudflare does this. Fastly does this as well, and I know Fastly protects it because I tested this specifically.<p>Cloudflare actually can set it in two different ways, however one of the ways is an upsell (only because it names it Real-Client-Ip which is apparently something set by other products, including Fastly). I was very amused when I got the Cloudflare rep to admit that.')
