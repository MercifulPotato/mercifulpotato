The one women who came a little too close to breaking into where some VIPs were was shot in the neck and died.<p>Meanwhile, the media and law enforcement approved of the women&#x27;s march protestors. They were free to roam around the capitol and physically harass and menace elected representatives suspected of not approving of their side. Including at times cornering them alone in elevators. They bragged about all of this and cheered each other on.')
