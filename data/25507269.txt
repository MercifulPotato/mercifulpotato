Whether it&#x27;s a quirk of vision or an outright disability really tends to depend on the intensity, for some people it doesn&#x27;t affect their lives at all but for others it&#x27;s completely disabling because they can&#x27;t read any more. Personally I&#x27;m quite lucky, I&#x27;m never going to drive in the dark or be good at things that require excellent vision but I can still hold down a job as a programmer.')
