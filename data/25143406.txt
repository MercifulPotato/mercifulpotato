The problem isn&#x27;t social, or political. The problem is one of economics. It simply isn&#x27;t in the interests of those manufacturing the voting machines to make them secure.<p>They go unpunished for flaws, and it isn&#x27;t legal, most of the time, for anyone to try and peak beneath the covers and see if there are flaws present.<p>They have no incentive to make things secure, and can simply attack anyone who tries to look at their security, with a high degree of success.<p>In a simple cost&#x2F;benefit analysis, it is cheaper to ignore security.
