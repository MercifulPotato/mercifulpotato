Prices were almost always is the $120-$150 a night range. Examples of bad: claiming to have reserved parking but not having parking. Claiming to be one place but being another. Claiming to have usable internet but not. Claiming to have a bed but just having a cot. etc...<p>At this point I&#x27;d mostly choose hotels over AirBnB because generally a hotel will try to fix an issue but AirBnb never will. Their position is effectively &quot;sucks to be you, you shouldn&#x27;t have chosen that listing&quot;.<p>They policy is basically &quot;unless it&#x27;s life threatening shutup!&quot; and the worst part is either you suck it up or you&#x27;re out a day of your vacation travel etc as you try to scramble to find another place. It&#x27;s not fun.')
