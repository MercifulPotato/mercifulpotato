I&#x27;m caught between a rock and a hard place...<p>Apart from their other downsides, stackful coroutines can make asynchronous code less readable. For example, it&#x27;s not obvious that your self:move() call is split across several frames.<p>Implicit coroutine construction has the silent failure mode which you describe.<p>Explicit coroutine construction, (coro f), would make `yield-from` even more noisy than it already is!<p>I wonder whether a naming convention would solve the problem? If all coroutine functions and methods have names like fire-arc* and move* , then your synchronous call to fire-arc* would stick out like a sore thumb. This would also force the programmer to visit every callsite after changing a synchronous function into an asynchronous one, or vice versa. It wouldn&#x27;t exactly be convenient, but I think I value explicitness more highly than convenience in this case.')
