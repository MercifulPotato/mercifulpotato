Spent a few million USD and ended with nothing much to show. Turns out formation flying is hard. Especially with satellites with limited orbital alignment capabilities, as the small uneven effects on the orbit from various sources (other planets, atmospheric drag, etc) eventually add up and you have to be able to correct the orbit from time to time to keep the formation. Apart from that, communications tech reliable enough for the kind of distributed in-orbit computation was still not there last I checked.<p>I wonder if anything has changed in the meanwhile.')
