I&#x27;ve been working on it for about 4 months and we&#x27;re close to launching the initial product. Although I&#x27;m at FAANG, my full-time job is nowhere near interesting or motivating to me as what I&#x27;m working on the side, which gets me up at any point in the night or day with 0 second thoughts.<p>Working out helps me a lot and allows me to refresh and get more capacity.
