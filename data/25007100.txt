Basically most if not all of what Google&#x2F;FAANG is doing.<p>Which European company does all those things and at such a large scale? Having some random small search engines that nobody is using, funded and kept alive by EU grants just to show that <i>&quot;we can&quot;</i>, is in no way comparable to the scale of Yandex.')
