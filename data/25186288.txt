So more internet than phone in that aspect, it&#x27;s not at all like SMS hiding in the free space in beacon frames. Therefore coverage won&#x27;t be any better. The only possible minimal difference would be using authentication via SIM&#x2F;carrier instead of the Whatsapp method of sending a confirmation code via SMS&#x2F;call. But that is a very minor difference.')
