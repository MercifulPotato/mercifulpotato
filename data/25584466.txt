Think about that.  He was in the upper half of the income distribution, on &quot;minimum wage&quot; ? really?<p>(A typical minimum wage job pays $10k a year BEFORE taxes -- 28 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, $7.25 an hour.  It is <i>extremely rare</i> for low wage employers to allow an employee to work more than 29 hours a week, as it may oblige them to offer benefits at the 30 hour mark, and extra pay at the 40 hour mark.)<p>2. There is not a single state in the union where median rents are as low as he describes -- did he just rent the very cheapest room in the entire 50 states?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experian.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;ask-experian&#x2F;research&#x2F;median-rental-rates-for-an-apartment-by-state&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experian.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;ask-experian&#x2F;research&#x2F;median-...</a><p>Americans <i>love</i> telling each other stories about how they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, but they also love to omit the details of how they got things like 45 hours a week, or made more than 50% of American workers, despite working for a &quot;minimum wage,&quot; or got paid time and a half on his &quot;minimum wage&quot; job, or found housing near a job center at below the median cost for even the most rural and blighted parts of the country.<p>All of these, individually, are staggeringly unlikely.  Together, they come off as the luckiest man alive. It seems impossible unless he was working in his uncle&#x27;s bakery and living in his brother&#x27;s apartment.<p>(The refreshing thing about this comic is that the author <i>didn&#x27;t</i> blow smoke up our asses about &quot;bootstraps,&quot; it&#x27;s very plain he felt lucky to escape his situation.)')
