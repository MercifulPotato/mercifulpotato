When u go to school, u r mostly rated on giving the single correct answer. This is fine. But if you get a chance to go into graduate studies (Ph.D.), u would see some good innovators there, and learn how to innovate. I am sure there are other life conditions that also teach you how to innovate. But I agree, by comparisons with the product managers in the enterprise where I work, people are scared of innovations and prefer the sure thing instead.')
