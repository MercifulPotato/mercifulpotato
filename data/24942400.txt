People put effort and time in writing good tutorials and software. You complain about “free” platforms selling your data, and about paid articles that they are “restricting learning opportunities”. How are they meant to support themselves if they service entitled people like you? You are restricting your own learning opportunities by not rewarding good content and people for their time and effort.')
