Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607118505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305722, text='Correct, you need a page but not a wall&#x2F;banner unless you need to seek consent for something.<p>Again, the law is not all lawyerspeak and it&#x27;s fairly easy to find if you click my link to the law above. Article 14(3):<p>&gt; The [website] shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:<p>&gt; (a) within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data [...]<p>&gt; (b) [...] at the time of the first communication to [the user] [...]<p>Where &quot;the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2&quot; is the basics: who you are, what you collect, for what purpose (marketing or so), retention period, what the user&#x27;s rights are, and other things that may apply from the lists in those paragraphs.<p>The easiest way to fulfill this is, of course, a nice little link at the bottom with this info laid out for everyone.<p>This is also perfect if you&#x27;re Google and your products, taken together, process basically every piece of data about a human going about their daily life. Then you basically say &quot;we collect basically every piece of data that you supply or that we can otherwise get our hands on&quot; and the user is not only none the wiser when they use only reCAPTCHA, but they now also agreed to the rest because that&#x27;s all in one policy.<p>By and large I&#x27;m still happy that it has improvements over the previous law (most notably enforcement and uniformity between member states) even if there are things to be improved, but I digress. Point is: policy available to read when desired: yes; annoying pop-up banner: NEIN :)')
