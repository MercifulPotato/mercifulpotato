A measured consideration of why they might do that?<p>Of course not. Immediately a false narrative was created that citadel forced them to do it under threat that they would stop their order flow. Had any politician or public\nfigure merely suggested we let the CEO of Robinhood explain the decision, they would’ve been dragged by the Twitter mob. Just look at how Steve Cohen, Lee Cooperman and John Fortt were shamed for raising what I believed to be perfectly legitimate questions. But nobody is interested in legitimate questions when it’s hive mind mob rule which is what <i>always</i> takes hold in a bubble. In fact the vilification of naysayers is one of the tell tale signs of a speculative bubble.<p>To answer the last question who are the speculators here, shorts or wsbers? Both. But what I’m talking about are the speculators who are simply buying this up with the expectation they will make huge gains like deep fucking value. They can say all they want about how they don’t care about potential losses and this is something bigger. Total nonsense. Let’s see who gets blamed and who plays the victim if we get a crash.<p>It’s an interesting world when Mark Cuban and chamath palyhapitia can be portrayed as champions of the little guy when they have made billions of dollars at their expense. Chamath takes a SPAC public every Tuesday. Who do we think are buying these up? Warren Buffett? Didn’t Cuban make his fortune selling a worthless business to Yahoo? These guys are using this entire thing to build their own popularity.')
