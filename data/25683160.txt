Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610099647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681188, text='&gt; Alumni returning to their colleges after 20-50 years may notice the following phenomena: there are a lot more buildings (with donor names on them) but there is an incredible number of empty rooms at any one point in time... many more than when they went to school back in the day.<p>I will be 40 later this year, and I continue to live next to the University I started attending over 20 years ago: the University of California, Santa Barbara. I mean, right now, campus is empty due to COVID-19; but, right before the world switched to &quot;everything from home&quot;, I am pretty sure that we had almost no free capacity... campus keeps buying and renting building as they need more classroom space, study space, and living space. Yes: there are a lot lot lot more buildings, and the footprint of the campus is much larger; but the entire campus is <i>packed</i> with people... the #1 thing that feels weird about it is not that the campus feels empty, but that the campus feels completely and utterly full despite all the new construction. The core areas of campus now have a ridiculous number of people swarming through them constantly, and people are now sometimes living four to a room in buildings where, when I was a student, there only had started to be rumors that someone might be in a triple somewhere (again: despite there having been a very large number of new housing projects built in the last couple decades). I just can&#x27;t track anything about your point here with my lived experience.')
