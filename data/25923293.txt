It&#x27;s not meant to be insulting at all. At most, it&#x27;s a personal reflection on certainty. I guess maybe it acts as something of a Rorschach test, but that wasn&#x27;t the intent either.<p>We could probably have an interesting conversation in person, maybe even a meaningful one; but on the internet that&#x27;s pretty much impossible. I certainly don&#x27;t expect to change your mind, or even to convince you there&#x27;s a possibility you might be wrong. You don&#x27;t seem to have anything particularly new or insighful  to add, so it&#x27;s unlikely my opinions will shift. So there&#x27;s not really a point in having a discussion, at least not in a format where we need to type out long comments and do point by point rebuttals.<p>And in any case other people are already doing the point my point contentious debate thing with you, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much of an effect on anyone so it&#x27;s a pretty obvious waste of time.<p>You seem the argumentative sort though so feel free to respond to this and explain why I&#x27;m wrong about whatever. I&#x27;ll be drinking scotch and I do recommend that instead, but whatever you decide have a nice Tuesday night.')
