Classic.<p>Nope, I&#x27;m not a furry, but over the years I&#x27;ve been quite fascinated by how people react to them.<p>For instance, the first person who responded to your comment seemed to correlate images of fursonas with partial nudity,  which is often sexualized.  Over the decades I&#x27;ve observed furries (which has been rather unavoidable as a gamer&#x2F;hacker), from what I can tell, it isn&#x27;t a sexual thing.  Sure, some furries are horny, and those furries like sexualized images... but there&#x27;s plenty of folks who are furry but don&#x27;t use that as an outlet for their sexual energies.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like leather.  Some people wear leather for protection, some people wear leather because it&#x27;s stylish... and some people have a leather kink.  The kinksters don&#x27;t ruin leather for the rest of us.')
