Shouldn&#x27;t the responsability lie with the student to actually do the math and not graduate in pottery at 20k$&#x2F;year since there is no chance of ever paying it back?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think tuition should be much lower in the US to avoid the situation entirely (much like we do in Canada), but it&#x27;s not like the debt magically appeared, they had to apply to college knowing what it would cost, chose to take on debt and then the government should &quot;fix&quot; that bad decision for them?')
