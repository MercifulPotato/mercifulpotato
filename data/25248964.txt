In this context the relevant check was for DIMMs dropping out.  What it read needed a fudge factor, because the value changed at least once with a BIOS update.  You couldn&#x27;t just check the number was the same as when you initially set it up.<p>Experience with several hundred-node clusters is that the hardware doesn&#x27;t obey the conservation law many people assume.  It&#x27;s not that uncommon to find cores and DIMMs disappearing from &quot;sight&quot; -- or being absent initially and not spotted by the vendor.  (I&#x27;ve yet to see an HPC cluster vendor that understands real system management.)')
