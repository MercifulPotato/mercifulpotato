When you want to move money out of a country you need to find someone willing to sell bitcoin in the currency you have. Then you need to find someone willing to buy the bitcoin in the new currency you want. Since it’s difficult already to move money between said currencies, the friction is likely to be seen as volatility in the price. You’ll also see big swings just from moving a lot of money.<p>I’d be more skeptical of the moving money around hypothesis but I know people who looked into it when thinking about leaving the US. So at least people are honestly looking at  bitcoin for that purpose, even if it may be impractical.')
