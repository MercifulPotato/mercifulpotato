Tesla&#x27;s cost to value ratio is the best in the business. Yes, you can find a cheaper electric car but it&#x27;ll also be a much worse car than Model 3.<p>If you spec VW&#x27;s ID.3 or ID.4 to the closest Model 3 &#x2F; Y, you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;re paying about the same for less (less range, smaller screen, software that is generation behind, no supercharging network and more).<p>Additionally, Tesla&#x27;s profit margins are the best in the car business (not just electric car business) while reports say that VW is loosing $3-$4k per car and doesn&#x27;t expect to have them profitable until 2025.<p>Or compare the prices of just unveiled GM&#x27;s Hummer EV with prices of Cybertruck. Hummer is 30-50% more expensive.<p>The first truly mass market car, the one that tips the scale towards electric cars, will also come from Tesla, not from any other car maker.<p>Tesla already announced $25k in 2022. No-one else is even close to producing a decent EV at such price.')
