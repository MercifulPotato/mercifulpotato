But in the case of Google Analytics, the author spends most of the words complaining about a bugged&#x2F;glitchy upgrade rollout. Which of course is worth complaining about, but shouldn&#x27;t be <i>the</i> main example in a screed about company-wide failure – has there ever been, in the history of tech, a product upgrade+redesign that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> glitch and anger long-time users?<p>But more to the point, GA is a specialized product for an audience of (relatively speaking) power users. What is the other analytics product that purports to deliver a comparable variety of metrics, in a more useful way? That&#x27;s not a rhetorical question – I honestly want to know, and expected an article with this headline to have specific and tangible comparisons.<p>In the case of GMail – I honestly couldn&#x27;t find how to get the specific view that the author sees. I&#x27;m still using the same GMail account that I opened in its launch month, which over the years I&#x27;ve tweaked to my liking – such as setting &quot;Button labels&quot; to &quot;Text&quot;. So I checked a relatively new alt-Gmail account, and also my main Hotmail&#x2F;Live account, and was surprised to see how similar the two interfaces are.<p>So what is the author&#x27;s point of reference when he claims <i>&quot;Even Gmail is a cesspool at this point. Nobody would ever design a webmail interface like that, starting from scratch&quot;</i>. I&#x27;m looking at my Hey account right now, and sure, it&#x27;s <i>different</i> from my GMail interface, but I also use it 0.001% as much as I do GMail, and for a much smaller subset of communications. I sure as hell wouldn&#x27;t tell people Hey is so much better than GMail and expect it to be self-evident to people, not without providing visual comparisons.')
