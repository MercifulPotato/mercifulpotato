Rust is more about that your program won&#x27;t trample memory and won&#x27;t crash.<p>That said, Rust seems to have reasonably good performance compared to C&#x2F;C++.  Also the concept of lifetimes is interesting too.<p>Just because your program compiles in C++&#x2F;Ada(no-spark)&#x2F;C&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Rust doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s correct.  If it compiles in Rust, the compiler is telling you it&#x27;s memory safe and thread safe.')
