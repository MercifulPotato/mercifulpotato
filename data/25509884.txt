Humans enjoy working with systems that so _something_ as soon as they interact with them and a placeholder&#x2F;spinner&#x2F;animation is that exact something. Of course, you don&#x27;t want any placeholders or animations to go on for too long, but it&#x27;s good to know that the button you just pressed actually did something and the screen hasn&#x27;t hung.<p>Minimal JS pages often have very little direct interaction built in, so they feel blazing fast when the connection is good and the payload is small (HN is a great example) but terribly slow if your internet connection is bad and it&#x27;s not masking the network delays (again, HN is a great example).<p>The 2-5s mentioned on Twitter are something else though, perhaps the Hey app is being transferred through a saturated connection in the US or something.')
