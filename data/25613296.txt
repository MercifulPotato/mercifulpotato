I’ve seen exactly this ext4 corruption in production on windows server 2012R2 with CentOS 7. Even to the point that the machine remounts root read only.  Unfortunately our windows operations guys are severely lacking in diagnostic savvy and just reboot the machine over and over again or blast it and provision a new one and don’t analyse the problem.<p>From what I’ve seen it’s a combination of the storage drivers and the storage virtualisation in HyperV rather than a specific issue. I imagine it’s something similar in WSL.<p>I really don’t trust it as a platform at all. It’s barely better with windows guests.')
