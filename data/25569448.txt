There is&#x2F;was (cat and mouse) a discord file server which allows you to use any text handling interface such as a shell window or text editor as a chat client. There is also an IRC file server which does the same and acts as a bouncer giving you a persistent connection. So you can have a single acme window open writing code, chatting on irc and discord while checking email and composing an email. It&#x27;s all text so treat is as such. Wild stuff.')
