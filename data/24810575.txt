Typically the way it works is when you initially charge the bill the card processor with authorize the amount of the meal plus some percentage (Pre-Auth - I forget the amount or it may vary) and then after the bill is signed you do a second transaction (post-auth) to record the final amount being charged and this releases any difference. Depending on the card processor it may not be possible to post-auth more then a certain percentage of tip because it exceeds the amount authorized and&#x2F;or they are flagging tips beyond a certain percentage as possible data entry errors and declining so that it does not result in a chargeback. So if you want to tip your waiter $1200 for a $20 meal, you ought to plan on doing it with cash.')
