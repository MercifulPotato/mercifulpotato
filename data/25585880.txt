So long as the federal money printer is still running, spreading money around to Americans will keep the economy alive during the pandemic. Who cares if you give a bit of extra to people who don’t deserve it? Chances are they’ll spend it on local food and what not which’ll help keep other people off unemployment. This is especially true in cases where speed is of the essence, since you’d happily accept some level of errors to get the aid out immediately.')
