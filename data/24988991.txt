What I am trying to figure out is why.<p>About 25 years ago, I was enthusiastic about exploring 3D computer graphics.  These days, I could hardly care less.  Challenge isn&#x27;t really an issue here because excellent 3-D graphics are more difficult to create simply because the bar has been raised so much higher.  I suspect that doing something that feels innovative may be a big part of the problem.  While this doesn&#x27;t take away from the personal challenge of learning something new, it does diminish the sense of accomplishment.  Or maybe something else is going on.')
