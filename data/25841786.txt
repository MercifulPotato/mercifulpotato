I&#x27;ve had them going on 8 years now, they still work perfectly after daily use outdoors, in the rain, thrown in bags etc for ~7 of those years. Battery still lasts 2-3 weeks with ~2 hours use per day and the only &quot;damage&quot; is the faux leather on the headband and ear cups peeling.<p>I replaced the latter and it&#x27;s like having a brand new pair of headphones.<p>Now granted that the codecs are old and audio quality will be better on something more modern, but I&#x27;d love to see if the air-pods last as long, particularly if given the same abuse my Sony&#x27;s have had.')
