Why does Mozilla need a CEO making millions? Why do they need a bay area HQ?<p>Said differently: I have no problem with how Mozilla raises money (although I do have some doubts about how much they&#x27;ll make by reselling a â‚¬5 VPN service for $5, even taking into account discounts), I have a problem with how Mozilla <i>spends</i> money.')
