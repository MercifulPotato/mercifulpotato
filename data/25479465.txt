There is never really a _true_ information state. Charles Sanders Peirce called the world we build a &#x27;phaneron,&#x27; the information state as presented by the senses. Everyone&#x27;s eyes are a blurry figment of what the true photonic field is. Same with touch when it comes to surfaces and well, all the senses. And those senses degrade over time as we age.<p>I hate hearing the phrase &#x27;real world&#x27; or &#x27;physical&#x27; being used to describe non-electronic interaction. Call the in-person stuff analog if you&#x27;d like. But the digital stuff is just as real. We never have the entire quantum state of other people accessible. We always just get a small blurry sample of their true presence. Does it matter whether it goes through air or down a copper wire?<p>The only difference is with regard to security. I can see that argument as valid. But unless security&#x2F;imposters are a concern, it&#x27;s still the real deal.')
