See below.<p><i>&gt; Different composition means different interactions during the fall and different amount of radiated energy.</i><p>All of that can be taken into account <i>before</i> the object falls into the hole; the observer outside can measure it all and deduct it from the mass he expects to be added to the hole.<p>We are talking about the mass that gets added <i>after</i> all that; and for any given mass added to the hole after all those things are taken into account, there are many different possible combinations of objects falling into the hole that can add that mass.<p><i>&gt; Infinite number of bits can be encoded in single real number.</i><p>We are not talking about math, we are talking about physics. The number of bits that can be stored in an object of finite size is finite as far as physics is concerned.')
