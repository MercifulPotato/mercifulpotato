If I say, let’s go and burn that police station down now!  Let’s be there at 9:15.  It’s pretty clear.  If you say, I wish that police station would get burned down.  I don’t know.  It’s not a nice thought, but you’re not actively working to have it burned down.  On the other hand the wish does not have pure intentions.<p>This is why I think it’s impossible to “monitor” and purge or ban violent tweets or what have you.<p>One, what is the intention of the speaker, two who is responsible for the audiences reaction?  Do you take the most extremely negative interpretation?  It cannot work.<p>And that’s not even taking slang into account where violent words don’t mean violence and normal words can take on other meanings.')
