One took place via Facebook&#x27;s own platform while the other did not.<p>If their own platform officially allowed for third parties to collect user data, it is reasonable to complain about that being the case.<p>If their own platform explicitly forbid collecting user data in such a manner but they stood by and let it happen anyway, it seems reasonable to object to that.<p>I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any of their business what a legitimate user does with their own data after it&#x27;s been sent to them (ie the page loads). I suppose they could add a provision to their ToS disallowing such use; if a violation were discovered they could ban the user in question. But a third party almost certainly never agreed to such a ToS. It&#x27;s not the existence of the program that violates the contract but rather a specific instance of its usage.')
