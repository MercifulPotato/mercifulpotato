Item(by='chrononaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609345646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582142, text='&gt; In practice, this means that I often need to skip past amazon entirely and go straight to the product manufacturer, sometimes paying more, just to be sure I&#x27;m not being screwed.<p>You&#x27;re not the only one. Depending on the item and it&#x27;s use I would probably pay upwards of a 20% premium just so I know there&#x27;s a far less chance of the received item being fraudulent.<p>Pandemic aside, these issues also have made me much more likely in the last 4 to 5 years to purposefully go shopping in-person at stores since they seem to have a higher chance of having a proper supply chain established.')
