Item(by='kian', descendants=None, kids=[24982024, 24984238], score=None, time=1604423960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980275, text='I think the poster you are replying to is saying that shutting down people for spreading false conspiracies will be a net negative,  because all of net harm from spreading false conspiracies is a tiny little drop against the vast hurricane of actual governmental conspiracies and the harm that can come from them, and that anything that might make it harder to hear about those conspiracies is far more harmful to the world than letting people say things that are untrue. (as evinced, here, by the poster pointing out that there was an actual governmental conspiracy in living memory, whereby hundreds of thousands or millions of (innocent) people died, in part because people were shut down as conspiracies theorists [or in some cases, even branded enemies of the state] and removed from discourse.)<p>I find it hard, as the poster seems to, to imagine a scenario in which even 100k clones of Alex Jones could cause the same level of harm.  And while Alex himself may never uncover any real conspiracies (and really,  how could you personally guarantee that?), that doesn&#x27;t mean the same tactics used on him won&#x27;t be turned on someone who has uncovered genuine malfeasance. (keep in mind, I&#x27;ve never been a fan, and I think he is a personally odious, obnoxious, and ill-intentioned individual who no one <i>should</i> listen to. Still,  he shouldn&#x27;t be silenced.)')
