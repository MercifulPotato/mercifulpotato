Item(by='Leherenn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605625923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25122333, text='It doesn&#x27;t have to be so negative I think.<p>There are two broad classes: changing regulations and clarifying&#x2F;improving existing ones.<p>The former are the easier ones, a shift in regulation can create new markets (and destroy others). Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a new mandated requirement for banks, if you can provide them with a solution then you have a very captive market. Conversely, sometimes new possibilities arise, e.g. instant transfers. The changing regulatory framework create vacuums to fill, and contrarily to new technologies, you don&#x27;t have to be on top of the game to fight in those spaces, just on point and on time.<p>As for the latter, sometimes things are done one way because navigating the regulation is so complex that no one really wants to do it. There&#x27;s already a solution, it works decently, why bother. However, as time goes by, cruft accumulates, or maybe technology makes it now easier to solve the problem or circumvent regulation. If you&#x27;re willing to do the work, then you can disrupt the existing market. I would class Uber and Airbnb in this category. It doesn&#x27;t have to be illegal though, it&#x27;s just that regulation is often unclear, especially if you go into the details, or in some new situations that did not exist when it was written.')
