I don&#x27;t really think of it like a &quot;want&quot; of a puppy because I had wants like a puppy too and those go away after a few weeks or months in childhood. It&#x27;s not something like years and years of never going away.<p>Btw, most people don&#x27;t consider that being denied something like I was and that has life long consequences as way more hurtful while knowing you were right; and others prevented you. Thinking about things in my life I&#x27;ve been wrong about, such events are way less painful because it felt like my fault when people weren&#x27;t involved by stoping me from what was right. The painful events are when people involved prevent what was right for you. Basically, it&#x27;s way more awful when you undergo the wrong circumstances because of someone else that prevented what you knew was right instead of undergoing what was wrong by your own mistake. I tried my best to make that not confusing before I go to sleep.')
