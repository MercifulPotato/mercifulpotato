It discusses many things you have mentioned. There&#x27;s only so much depth one can put in a comment, but some of my favorite books are ones I found metioned in passing here. You can take it or leave it.<p>I&#x27;m really not sure what the &quot;mainsteam science of food&quot; is. Studies linking food to health outcomes are notoroiously low quality, and there isn&#x27;t strong consensus on most things, other than basic stuff like &quot;eat more vegetables.&quot; And it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that the USDA was saying &quot;eat more grains, less veggies.&quot; If you think it is simple I would suggest you read a larger variety of sources. Human health is a very complex subject and there is a lot we still don&#x27;t know.<p>I would rather we teach people how to help themselves, rather than teaching them ways to trick themselves. It&#x27;s hard to trick yourself for long periods of time, especially when you are up against biological imperatives. People who&#x27;s strategies don&#x27;t rely on tricks are more successful.')
