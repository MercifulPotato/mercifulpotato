I mean what type of products would we need to stop using if we wanted to actually take this issue, I find it hard to believe that &quot;all&quot; plastic&quot; use would be bad by default, I&#x27;m sure some uses must be much worse than others.<p>It does mention in the article that this plastic is likely from cosmetics, which I cannot believe there are plastic in cosmetics, wow.<p>Thinking thing from things like tyre dust, cosmetics etc.')
