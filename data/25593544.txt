[1]  A cop, truck driver and a passenger car with a little girl were pinned together under water in a lake.  The NS4 (robot) passing by saw the accident and calculated the cop would have the highest probability for survival and rescued him and not the child, giving him PTSD.<p>I am morbidly curious how much from that movie will play out with cars and other machinery as things evolve.  I am also curious if we will learn any lessons ahead of time or if like city traffic lights, {n} number of people have to die before it becomes a financially viable discussion.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_MFGx8d1zl0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_MFGx8d1zl0</a>')
