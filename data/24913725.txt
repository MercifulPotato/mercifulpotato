It was early in my career, and part of my duties was to run a merge&#x2F;purge process on dupe records.<p>I&#x27;d select the dupes for merge using a checkbox, but the vendor&#x27;s interface for this just had a &quot;confirm&quot; button. So, I confirmed. However I&#x27;d selected the &quot;select all&quot; box and.... confirmed. Merging every. single. record. into one (1) record.<p>I was fortunate, the vendor was able to roll back the changes, and nothing was lost. I also had a very good mentor-like boss who avoided reaming me out before we knew if there was a solution or not, and when there was he simply told me &quot;I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve learned your lesson, but don&#x27;t do that again.&quot;')
