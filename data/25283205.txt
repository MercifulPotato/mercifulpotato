If a small change like this costs a company any more than a thousand bucks, they are Doing it Wrong.<p>You might argue that $1k is also a lot to expect, but consider that the company has likely already spent north of $25k (and sometimes a <i>lot</i> more than that) on the recruiting process that brought them this new employee.  If they&#x27;re going to throw that away to avoid an internal approval process that costs another thousand, that sounds like a bad financial decision to me.')
