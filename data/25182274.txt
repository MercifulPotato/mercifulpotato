This is an indictment of the media who have failed in their job at keeping the public informed in an unbiased manner, reducing complex macro-economics and geopolitics to catchy headlines and gotcha-questions.<p>Is my country any better? God no, most of our media is just a budget version of the American model, but it is America who infected the rest of the world with this.<p>When policy and idea&#x27;s become the most important part of any election, that&#x27;s when you can start addressing real social and economic problems like homelessness, LGBT rights, wealth disparity and the loss of jobs to offshoring manufacturing, because you&#x27;ll have more time to discuss these things like adults now that politicians aren&#x27;t reducing their job to 140 character hot-takes.')
