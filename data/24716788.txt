Observe how it lacks the Blog link in the header, which is missing in what the server is rendering—see &#x2F;images&#x2F;index.html in the repository.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instantmultipageapp.com&#x2F;images" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instantmultipageapp.com&#x2F;images</a> loads from the service worker, and the server serves &#x2F;index.html for it (which is very wrong) rather than &#x2F;images&#x2F;index.html.<p>This is purely a bug in the demo. Kind of a fundamental bug that leaves me unimpressed, but a simple bug nonetheless. If you were to actually run the service worker on the backend, it’d resolve this kind of problem, and also the inconsistency between what the two platforms render, as seen in the missing Blog link.')
