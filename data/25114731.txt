I think it&#x27;s the organization working as 20 engineering teams of 50 people each, and where the 20 leaders meet a few times a year in a single location or perhaps a few locations around the world.<p>I also don&#x27;t think that people who have lived for 10 years in the San Francisco Bay Area or New York metro area are well equipped to live in a random American small town where the town is nearly monoracial and the local fine dining is an Olive Garden.<p>Both of these are recipes for strong economic growth (and of course, the attendant gentrification) in small cities in America and around the world.')
