The chips in the phones are not actively cooled and run circles around their Intel equivalents. Apple won’t change the thinness and cooling characteristics of their laptops but were likely hoping Intel would improve their processes such that they’d run cooler. Now that Apple will have control over the silicon and even have the actively cooled potential performance should rise not to mention all the acceleration they’re building into the chips themselves. I don’t have hard evidence other than the initial performance of the dev kits and the utmost bullish take on Apple’s in-house chip designers: I don’t know why anyone would bet against them.<p>That being said I think the OS is holding the platform back a ton. For me Docker is a huge part of my workflow and the need for a Linux VM is a deal breaker on my Mac. Spinning up docker means my mac’s fans scream at almost 100%. I hate that. Since moving to an admittedly uglier Dell Linux laptop (not an XPS) I don’t have that same issue.')
