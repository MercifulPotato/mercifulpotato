It&#x27;s been experimentally proven many times that at the moment you look at your marble, the other marble&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 probability of being red and blue shifts substantially to, for example 75&#x2F;25. And that&#x27;s without it having any way of knowing that you&#x27;ve seen your marble. So there are hidden variables that we don&#x27;t understand, but they&#x27;re not local. They somehow affect both marbles.<p>This is completely incorrect, to the point where what you were trying to correct was actually more accurate, though incomplete.<p>The usual setup is that for any given axis, each person always measures 50:50.  Measuring your own doesn&#x27;t change the odds of the other.<p>Knowing the _results_ of your own does.  For the same axis, the correlation is exact.  For axes with an angle theta between them, we get a correlation of R ~ cos(theta&#x2F;2).<p>The upshot is that there is no underlying (classical) probability distribution that can give rise to this that can explain things for all measurement axes.  This is sometimes glossed as &quot;correlation without correlata&quot;.')
