The item you&#x27;re buying may be GME stock, but now it also has an attached buyer that is contractually obligated to buy at ANY price. That is the premium people are paying for GME stock.<p>If you buy high and hold, they can&#x27;t buy from you.<p>So even if they buy at a high price from someone else... which is great for that someone else, sure... what are you getting out of it?<p>If you bought earlier and are trying to sell now, the answer is obvious, but then... that&#x27;s a VERY different game than the one people claim to be playing.')
