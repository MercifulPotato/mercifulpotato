Like, if I live in Oregon, there&#x27;s nothing stopping me from going on vacation to another state for months out of the year. So why can&#x27;t I &quot;move&quot; there without having to physically go there? I think about this in context of the red&#x2F;blue voting divide. If a couple million people in safe blue states &quot;move&quot; to red states, then the Senate would be more representative of the population. Or even to counties across the same state to break up gerrymandering.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s illegal in a bevy of different ways, though.')
