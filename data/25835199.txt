Simply lowering prices won&#x27;t achieve that. Becoming the cheap option is likely the beginning of a death spiral the company will never recover from -- it will give the company an excuse to double down on a failing strategy.<p>Furthermore, AMD is not the biggest threat to Intel. The biggest threat is cloud providers like Amazon designing their own chips, which is already happening. If those succeed, who would build them? Certainly not Intel, if they continue to manufacture only their own designs -- that business, like so much other fab business, will go to TSMC.')
