You are arguing that we have no problem, and we don&#x27;t need to do any of the three! No wonder it&#x27;s an unpopular opinion. Reducing consumption means reducing production. It doesn&#x27;t matter how effective litter prevention and recycling programs are, it doesn&#x27;t matter how seemingly bullet-proof landfills are, some percentage of produced plastic ends up as waste in the environment (estimates range from 5 to 11%). Production goes up, litter goes up. Simple equation.<p>We need to massively reduce single-use plastics.<p>Even in advanced landfill-having countries, single-use plastics end up as litter in the environment, but the millions of tons per year.

Landfills or not, it&#x27;s everywhere.<p>We need to massively reduce single-use plastics.<p>We need to massively reduce single-use plastics.')
