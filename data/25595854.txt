Item(by='brabel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609441223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595332, text='WASM is definitely more low-level than JVM byte code right now... but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll remain that way given the many proposals that are very likely to be implemented in the future (even though it&#x27;s taking a long time for even simple ones, like multi-value returns, to get into the standard). For example, with WASI and GC, which will finally enable direct access to the DOM, how much lower-level will WASM be compared to JVM? Not much, I would say.<p>The big difference is that WASM, from the beginning, is supported by all the browsers natively (a consequence of it not being a proprietary technology, but an open standard), not as a plugin... If Java had started that way, the story would&#x27;ve turned out quite differently (but we know that at the time, the browser everyone was using was made by Microsoft, and Sun was a competitor so this would&#x27;ve never happened).')
