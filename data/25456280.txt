Was gonna use GitHub Pages fronted by Cloudflare but this is even better since it has preview and password capabilities.<p>If anybody from Cloudflare is listening I would love to get on the beta asap. Would also be great if you had some ready to go simple, clean blogging templates :)<p>I&#x27;m generally impressed with the direction Cloudflare is moving, they have some really powerful and innovative infrastructure primitives (workers, durable objects) and a killer network. Going to be interesting to see how they take advantage of that as they build out higher level offerings.<p>By the way, if anybody has recommendations for simple, clean, modern looking blog template (something like medium) that they have actually used, I am all ears.
