Each distro has its own package manager and set of packages. Yay, yum, apt, pacman, dpkg, portage, the list is near endless and as each package manager needs a reason to exist, each will try to be different. For simple use cases such as installing a package, this is fine. But for example, finding out how to search for available packages can take quite some time on a new distro.<p>And having all these different package managers require me to either have blind trust in a lot of different communities, or spend a lot of time comparing CRCs and reading code.')
