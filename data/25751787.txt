I don&#x27;t think it is by any stretch of the imagination.<p>---<p>&gt; It seems like the answer is &quot;everyone buys their own TLD&quot;, right?<p>Yeah, why not? The conceptual distinction between a domain and a TLD isn&#x27;t necessary. From the Namebase docs:<p>&gt; For instance, if you own &quot;nakamoto&quot; on Handshake, you can use &quot;nakamoto&quot; as a domain itself. In that case, you would point &quot;nakamoto&quot; to your website and visit it at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nakamoto&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nakamoto&#x2F;</a> in your browser. You can also use &quot;nakamoto&quot; as a TLD and issue your own subdomains. In that case you can create &quot;satoshi.nakamoto&quot; and visit it at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;satoshi.nakamoto" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;satoshi.nakamoto</a> in your browser. A Handshake name can be used as both a domain name directly and as a TLD at the same time.<p>---<p>&gt; And if you buy space from someone else&#x27;s TLD, well... you&#x27;ve just given someone the power to censor you.<p>Maybe? Buying from someone else&#x27;s TLD isn&#x27;t the point of Handshake, for the reasons I mentioned above. But if you wanted to buy a subdomain for some reason, and still wanted it to be uncensorable, you should buy one from someone who revokes their censorship capabilities programmatically.<p>And that point is the big picture: reasoning about transparent code for very important things gives you a level of control you can&#x27;t obtain through trusting people.')
