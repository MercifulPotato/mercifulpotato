Sure, it&#x27;s not renewable, but it also would be carbon-neutral (assuming the carbon is 100% captured).  We shouldn&#x27;t let ideological issues get in the way. So what if fossil fuel companies benefit from it instead of battery companies?<p>If we were to implement a carbon tax instead of picking winners, &#x27;blue&#x27; hydrogen would come out ahead of &#x27;green&#x27; hydrogen for at least the next decade, but hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would probably still loose out to batteries for most automotive applications.')
