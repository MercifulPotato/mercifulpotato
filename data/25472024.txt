Geforce Now is great, but it has a caveat that make it dicey: â‰¤1080p only, and the window it creates cannot be resized. You&#x27;re stuck with stretched 1080 if you&#x27;re on a larger monitor (though it at least preserves aspect ratio when stretching).<p>Graphics are excellent, I was running on Ultra RTX (remember, 1080p) in most of the city and getting 50 fps, and latency was around 20-30ms. For how most games play, it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable. $5 a month is a great deal, though I do wonder how Stadia stacks up. I certainly could have used the better resolution.<p>It also works on iPad&#x2F;iPhone and Android decently, if you want to play anywhere. I didn&#x27;t have any issues trying my iPad, though it appears you&#x27;re stuck with controller input on that.')
