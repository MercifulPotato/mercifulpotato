It wasn&#x27;t SARS who funneled that money out of the country (almost certainly HSBC). It&#x27;s not SARS that is refusing to attend court dates for a criminal trial into the matter. It was a long, well planned and well executed hijacking of social structure and just jaw dropping corruption.<p>That Zuma dodged tax responsibilities is nowhere near as problematic as the arms deal [0], or state capture [1]<p>The New York Times completely misses the point with this article.<p>CORRUPTION is the root of collapse of a system of governance. A better argument to make here is that the IRS&#x27;s woes are a red flag that should be jumped on.
