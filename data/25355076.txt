All the provider has to do is just... <i>not</i> modify the software, or only make modifications that don&#x27;t expose their proprietary orchestration systems and benefit everyone else in the process (but they really benefit the most, because they&#x27;re making money off of the software).<p>If you get more nefarious with it, what if they started building tooling around it -- like a proxy that rewrote requests to fix a bug, or a file system that sat underneath the program that solved some issue with IO?<p>I also think that the <i>majority</i> of value delivered by something like RDS is not actually proprietary changes, it&#x27;s just the underlying software being kinda good (because it was developed in the open, and the F&#x2F;OSS community was leveraged as bug finders and fixers) -- I&#x27;m thinking mostly of Postgres. Even things like HA and scalability are often considered in projects these days, so you wouldn&#x27;t even need to add much to check off the usual enterprise-y boxes.')
