I don&#x27;t care&quot; - that is how this kind of comment reads. But let&#x27;s move on.<p>No, I think I&#x27;ll respond to that. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t _care_, but it&#x27;s naive at best to expect anything else. Besides, if your license allows it, they&#x27;re not really taking advantage are they? Change your license.<p>&gt;Everyone can use and modify it, but if a large company with a market cap above $100m or a company wholly funded or owned by such company decides to utilize this project as a for-profit service, then said large company must hire me at for no less than $175,000 in 2020 value.<p>Seems incredibly difficult to implement logistically, and most companies will probably just say &quot;screw it&quot; as they all hope to be valued at &gt; 100M some day. Just enforce a per-basis license negotiation for commercial use or disallow it entirely. What happens if a company goes from a cap of 99M -&gt; 101M -&gt; 98M (etc etc). Just seems wrought with obvious problems.')
