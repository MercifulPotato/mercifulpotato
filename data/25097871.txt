It <i>might</i> be interceptable.<p>HTTP is always interceptable.<p>But there should be zero reason not to set this connection up with a full proper cert. HTTP is just mega sloppy.<p>As others mentioned, you can bootstrap TLS by first checking OCSP (in the open) on your cert auth service, then use that opaque, freshly-checked connection to check the rest.')
