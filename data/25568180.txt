Each time someone raises serious issue especially against gov or big corporation, s&#x2F;he is scaremongering?! It is like a super powered dismissive term to stop all conversation. \nI guess tobacco industry is also using scare mongering when people were raising voice because so many of cancer cases.<p>Someone being scared depends on so many things and it is subjective. On the other hand being paralyzed by our mind projections or being prepared to do something about is different thing. Flight of fight response...<p>Personally I would rather know, whatever information is, and how bad it is, than choosing alternative to bury my head into the sand when ever says something that is bad. \nYou can act only if you have information, and only way to propagate information (unfortunately) in our society is if it shocking. Good news simply do not sell papers.\nJust imagine, in IT projects, someone finds a back door or Zero-day exploit, and you alarm the company and they answer, &quot;nah it is all ok, stop scaremongering users&quot; ?!<p>I am trying to imagine doctor that says to the colleague, this man has serious heart failure or cancer, but I should not tell him as that may scared him.<p>Trying to remember the movie scene&#x2F;motivation speech where narrator says &quot;Fear is good it keeps you alive.&quot;<p>Fear is good prevent us doing stupid things...')
