People choose social networks based on which people are on them. Social networks controlling what you see is therefore much more dangerous than newspapers controlling what you see, since if you don&#x27;t like what you see in a newspaper you can just switch but if you don&#x27;t like twitter removing your posts most of your reasons to stay are still there.')
