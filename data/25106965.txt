I think being a parasite usually requires two conditions be met: 1 is that they&#x27;re separate species, and 2 is that it&#x27;s bad for the creature. Children eventually grow up and generally take care of the &quot;host&quot; that they sucked blood from, and their existence is generally beneficial for the species, so it&#x27;s hard to define as a parasite.')
