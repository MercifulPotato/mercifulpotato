I tell them it&#x27;s like learning to drive in an 18 wheeler with a manual transmission.<p>Not really. You don&#x27;t have to use all its features, they are neither necessary nor intrusive. E.g. I hardly know, let alone use more than 10% of its functionality. The only reasons I use it are very smart code completion, refactoring (rename variable&#x2F;class&#x2F;function&#x2F;whatever, jump to definition, find all usages), breakpoint debugger, auto imports suggestions, and type hints derivation. I barely even use menu items besides &quot;reformat code&quot;. But the smart code completion IntelliJ IDEs offer is by far the best on the market so its worth that. Extremely useful for lazy&#x2F;occasional&#x2F;novice coders who don&#x27;t remember APIs by heart and don&#x27;t want to sopend much time browsing the docs every time.')
