I oppose any standards that for a gifted and talented school that allow anything but test scores on blindly marked tests to count because I trust that they will be used to keep the wrong sort out, whether that’s currently Asians or Jews.<p>IB is at best very little better than AP. If you’re not teaching actual college level material like Bard College at Simon’s Rock[1] a limited amount will be lost by allowing administrators more leeway to discriminate against Asians.<p>I apologize for my overwrought language. I pattern matched your opposition to the current regime to the Ed school orthodoxy or the San Franciscan attempt to actually end Lowell.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simons-rock.edu&#x2F;academics&#x2F;index.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simons-rock.edu&#x2F;academics&#x2F;index.php</a>')
