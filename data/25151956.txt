I mean almost everyone is at least somewhat familiar with cloud services, SaaS, DBaaS etc.  All of those services have established pricing models and it isn&#x27;t based on X% of what your business charges.<p>Apple could easily charge $100 for an app to be reviewed the first time and $50 an update to cover review, and the rest is very marginal. What Apple is doing is rent seeking on other people&#x27;s work, plain and simple... it isn&#x27;t even based on the profit margin against that work.<p>Not every application is a game on a console that will see millions in sales to make up for development costs.  Consoles only see dozens of games as competition, the Apple store sees thousands.  It&#x27;s not an Apples to Apples comparison (pun intended).')
