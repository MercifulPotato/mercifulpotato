Short from banning you or outright censoring you, could all your activity ; posts, comments, etc... be penalized &#x2F; downweighted automatically without you being informed ?<p>My question is 1 ) is this technically feasible ( I&#x27;m assuming it is ) and 2 ) is it being done by say Facebook, LinkedIn et al. 3 ) Is that in the terms and conditions ( I haven&#x27;t read them yet because I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s not in there whether this is a thing or not ). Anyone in the know ?')
