They could be hearing many different sources of low frequencies (long wavelengths), which have high resonance ergo long range.<p>The most general (worldwide) sources I can think of would be high altitude wind, or subterranean water flow.  I heard the hum, middle of last night, after two days heavy rain, and I live over a large watershed.  I have sensitive hearing and big ears.  The study should also ask people to rate their motion sensitivity.')
