When I was younger I was caught up in the pinch of the 2008 market. I had to quit university and move across the country to find some work.<p>I harboured a lot of bitterness and built up ideals that were not based in reality. It took some time for me to realize that  it&#x27;s never as simple a situation as you want it to be, and no amount of pain inflicted against the simplified other that you&#x27;ve created for yourself will rectify anything.<p>Blindly attacking anything that resembles the enemy you&#x27;ve crafted in your own mind will just end up hurting a lot of others like yourself, and most of all: oneself.<p>For the record, it was Ghandi who said that. It&#x27;s about rising above the condition of those who hurt you in order to not become the thing you resented. What do you benefit the world simply usurping your detractor(s)?')
