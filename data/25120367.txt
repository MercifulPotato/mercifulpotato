It’s not directly analogous to the YouTube system, but as the EFF points out, the RIAA’s reliance on German law has its own problems.<p>&gt; When Petrolink learned that one of its largest customers, EOG Resources, might switch over to Digidrill’s visualization service, Petrolink took action. Instead of paying Digidrill for access to the corrected drilling data via LiveLog, Petrolink obtained a laptop running DataLogger – along with the corresponding USB security dongle – and then, after realizing DataLogger used an open source Firebird database, managed to gain access to the database by using Firebird&#x27;s default administrator username and password. Armed with this access, Petrolink developed a program named “RIG WITSML” (dubbed “the scraper” or “the hack”) that could be installed on an MWD company’s computer running DataLogger in order to – in real time – query corrected drilling data from the DataLogger database and transfer that information to PetroVault for visualization. Petrolink then began installing this RIG WITSML program on MWD computers running DataLogger at more than 300 well sites.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;4765801&#x2F;digital-drilling-data-systems-v-petrolink-service&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;4765801&#x2F;digital-drilli...</a>')
