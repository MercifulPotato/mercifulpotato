When you write a local closure you are preventing it from ever being reused. The philosophy of this style is to assume an unknown future where anything has the possibility of being reused.<p>When too much of your logic gets inserted into &quot;local closures&quot; your program will be more likely to hit the type of organizational technical debt I am talking about above.<p>It&#x27;s not a huge deal breaker though, you can always duplicate your code to deal with it. I&#x27;m not against shortcuts but most programmers need to know when they are actually taking a shortcut while being aware of the formal rules that will actually eliminate organizational technical debt.<p>Many functional programmers are unaware of the the origins of organizational technical debt and mistakenly build technical debt into their programs with closures even when it wasn&#x27;t their intention which is separate from your case as you are doing it intentionally.')
