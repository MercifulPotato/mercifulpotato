Why aren&#x27;t they being criticised? It&#x27;s exactly the same principle.<p>In the end it comes down to the fact that people are being conditioned that they should have an opinion or position on everything, because &quot;everything is politics&quot;. And many people fall for that and therefore search around for some indication on what opinions are out there.<p>Instead we should be propagating the message that it&#x27;s entirely fine not to have an opinion on something that doesn&#x27;t affect you.
