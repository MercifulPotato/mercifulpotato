The beginner question is, why don&#x27;t we use triangle waves of square waves? Those also have amplitude, frequency and phase. Frequency just means the reciprocal of the period.<p>To which my answer is that the magical property of complex exponential functions is that they can be shifted by constant (pointwise) multiplication. Which is a really non-obvious fact at first but is crucial in the machinery.<p>The complex exponentials constitute an orthogonal basis which diagonalizes the convolution.')
