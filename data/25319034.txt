BBC certainly isn&#x27;t doing much to damp down political hatred so what&#x27;s their true aim? I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s just to reinforce whatever arbitrary ideals of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; their culture has converged on and actually stoke hatred towards their perceived enemies because their culture encourages that.<p>Modern Islam is pretty strongly anti-science and has been for half its existence - since the end of the golden age. So it&#x27;s probably not enlightening to think of those ancient people as being part of the same group as modern Muslims. It&#x27;s almost a different religion. Then, it was open to free thinking and tolerant of outsiders and non-Muslims. Now, it&#x27;s socially conservative, rigid in what thoughts are allowed, isolationist and intolerant of anyone critical of the religion.')
