Mainland china has 1.4 billion people. I believe the &quot;self-determination&quot; part is already settled.<p>&gt; and our support if they decide to go their own way.<p>Nope. Let them settle it. We shouldn&#x27;t have been involved in the first place.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s always been odd to me that the U.S. chooses to placate Beijing, at the risk of losing a reliable partner (Taiwan) in a strategic industry.<p>Are you serious? One is the second largest economy in the world. The other is taiwan.<p>Every week, there is some bullshit blog spam about how important TSMC is. Why is that? Who is paying for it?')
