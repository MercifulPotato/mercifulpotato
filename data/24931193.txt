They&#x27;re not strongly predictive though. In-context (say, a stock market) these theories can be somewhat dependable. &quot;Predictive&quot; is a strong term, but it&#x27;s less wrong within highly similar contexts... that&#x27;s how trading algorithms (non NN ones) work. They theorize within highly limited contexts.<p>In practice, these theories can be predictive enough to be successful trading strategies. In most cases, to be investably predictive a theory needs to be narrow. Certain asset classes, certain epochs, etc. Certain market conditions.<p>Even though they use similar concepts (supply, demand, price, and their marginal determinations), a theory about energy bonds cannot be applied to urban real estate. More academic theories go for generality. Broader theory, but not tradable predictive.<p>&quot;<i>Government and academics are still debating how much money is needed to distort a market. The truth is, not a whole lot is required to distort any asset market. This is a problem the stock market has been dealing with since the 1920s</i>&quot;<p>Sure. Not much is <i>required</i>, but that just makes it plausible. I&#x27;d wager some real estate markets are <i>much</i> harder to nudge than others. The highly sensitive marginal dynamics this article is  theorising aren&#x27;t a feature of all real estate markets at all times. They&#x27;re almost certainly very linked to bubble&#x2F;bull markets.<p>One rare example of broader theory being applied to actual trading is Soros. I think his concepts probably apply here. &quot;Reflexivity,&quot; specifically.')
