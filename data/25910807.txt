Plants that contain psilocin and psilocybin, DMT, THC, ibogaine, mescaline, and any other natural compounds should not be illegal.<p>However, man-made drugs that are chemically derived such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl, etc. should most certainly be kept on the illegal list.<p>Why the personal distinction? Because the natural &quot;drugs&quot; are not addictive, they are psychosomatically harmless, they have been found to be extensively therapeutic, and it&#x27;s nigh impossible to surpass the LD50 and induce a lethal overdose. On the other hand, man-made drugs destroy the body, the mind, have lead to an ongoing opioid crisis, and can easily lead to death.<p>Just my $0.02')
