So far all such attempts have led to theories which are not renormalisable. Renormalisation is not an absolute requirement for a useful quantum theory; you can do perfectly good physics in a non renormalisable theory with a high energy cut off. But we only expect quantum gravity effects to be noticeable in high energy &#x2F; curvature regimes so that&#x27;s no good to us. We already have a perfectly good low energy theory of gravity that explains all observable phenomena after all: It’s called General Relativity. A non-renormalisable theory that results in infinities that cannot be eliminated in the energy regimes that you hope to probe is not a useful theory.<p>The other source of difficulty is that existing quantum theories assume a flat spacetime background. Reworking them to account for curved spacetime makes the mathematics much harder, even if you only assume a fixed but curved background.<p>So we need new ideas, because the existing ideas give infinite answers in the regime where existing theories fail, but even testing such new ideas mathematically is currently challenging &amp; very few people have the mathematical background required.')
