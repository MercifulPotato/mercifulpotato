I have worked at multiple FAANGs (currently in one) and startups.<p>I have been stuck at SDE-2&#x2F;E4&#x2F;L4 (a level above new grad in BigCos) level for around 5 years now. I want to be more of a leader but I do not know how. I am also rather sensitive&#x2F;introverted so not a typical leader like personality.<p>Can anyone relate? Have you personally navigated something like this, or seen someone do it?')
