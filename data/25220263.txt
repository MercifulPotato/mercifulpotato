It&#x27;s only a lie if you have been indoctrinated by EPA because of hegemonial car politics in the US favouring gas.<p>Diesel still is more efficient than electro taking the whole supply chain into account. The lack of efficiency of e-vehicles is only justified if you have a &quot;I do not care about efficiency&quot; power source = the sun. And even in that case its questionable if the required ressources to produce, distribute and refurbish batteries will ever outcompete the production ressource requirements of carbon fuel.<p>Not to speak about that you can pour every diesel in every car, this is not true for car batteries.')
