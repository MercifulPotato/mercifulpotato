With little fiefdoms here, little fiefdoms there, budget battles, pet projects, clawing of funds, burrowing.  Agencies are held together by two things - a dusty org chart that&#x27;s drifted far away from reality long ago, and procedural stuff like budgeting and delegation of authority that just has to be observed.<p>Between duplicative functions performed by competing departments and counterproductive internal priorities that reflect the coteries they come from, IMO, not that dissimilar from larger established private companies.')
