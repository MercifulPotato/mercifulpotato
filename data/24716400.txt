Any sufficiently complex library is essentially an embedded language that must be learned in addition to the base language: the cost of learning a language made out of macros isn&#x27;t much different from learning a library with a large API surface area.<p>In fact, since macros reduce the noise in the &quot;language&quot; a library implements, I&#x27;ve generally found that macro-based libraries are somewhat easier to learn than libraries in other languages.')
