I ask because English is not my native language.  Around the time I learned English in high school I also became interested in computers, which to me then meant programming in BASIC.  It took an embarrassingly long time for me to realize that e.g. GOTO was actually formed from &#x27;go to&#x27; -- to me, &quot;GOTO &lt;n&gt;&quot; just meant that program flow would continue at line &lt;n&gt;, nothing more, nothing less.  &quot;IF&quot; was just a mnemonic introducing a conditional branch, etc. .  I didn&#x27;t perceive my poor grasp on English as a hindrance in learning to program (as thankfully introductory text were available in my native language).  Of course, you need a good handle on the language, when communicating with co-workers (and all code is communication), but that came much later.')
