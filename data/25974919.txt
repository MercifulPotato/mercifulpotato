You are simply forced to put one or even two layers in front of it with a multi-process architecture just to get it to a baseline deployable state (in this case, traefik + gunicorn). But the good news is there are so many people doing that it really isn&#x27;t a problem. And it turns out you probably want that architecture anyway (probably best if your application server isn&#x27;t also doing your TLS etc).')
