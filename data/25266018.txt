Item(by='skuhn', descendants=None, kids=[25266554, 25266193], score=None, time=1606836834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265692, text='There was a brief push by the government to encourage funding of things like Solyndra under Obama, but obviously that didn&#x27;t all pan out.<p>I think that putting substantial funding into making the US the world leader in climate change related technology is such an obvious slam dunk that it defies belief for me that there seems to be no political will to do it.<p>Argue about the reality of climate change if you must, but the simple facts are that there is finite oil, finite coal, finite natural gas and the extraction and processing of those fuels is an expensive and dirty business. Of course solar, wind, hydro and nuclear don&#x27;t compete yet -- how about putting in the same R&amp;D money as fossil fuels? And when you make it work, the entire world will buy this tech from you. It could clearly be the US&#x27;s next economic gold rush, after the Internet and post-WW2 manufacturing (and, I guess, the gold rush).<p>I do wonder if the economic approach is just doomed to be a non-starter, and if the faster way is to frame it as a national security issue. That leads to a number of other problems, but time is clearly of the essence and they know how to spend money over there.')
