He was meant to denounce the attack but ended up giving his fanatics a nod and a wink.<p>At least one of those people were present at the Capitol siege, he made it into Pelosi&#x27;s office. After the siege Trump called these people special. Again with the wink and nod instead of denouncing things outright.<p>Same people, years later engaging in the same terrorist activity, again supported by Trump during a time when he was meant to denounce.<p>The guy who was present for both incidents goes by &quot;Baked Alaska.&quot;')
