I’ve always viewed diaries as  pointless items until I was enticed by one simply due to its aesthetic and ended up making a purchase. It’s quite convenient to have something available to just scribble ideas in and declutter your mind. Of course, I don’t use it in the traditional sense for reflecting everyday, however once in a while, I jot down goals and future plans, as well as accomplishments. And this offers a peace of mind, increasing daily efficiency, which is great for my startup.')
