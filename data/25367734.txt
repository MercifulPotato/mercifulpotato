It is the lack of retraction of the earlier &quot;there was no election fraud&quot; claim. Just because the number of missing votes found during the recount ended up not changing the outcome doesn&#x27;t mean that the earlier claims of &quot;there was no election fraud and missing votes&quot; were correct, because they, according to the recount, are factually incorrect.')
