I work in the industry, and by far the #1 most jarring misconceptions I see floating around forums like this is conflating of &quot;privatized&quot; with &quot;employer sponsored because of decades of tax incentives and mandates&quot;. The US is not the only country that has a public-private mix of healthcare, but it is pretty much the only developed country where private health insurance is predominately received through employers rather than on the individual market.<p>If you want a true apples-to-apples cost of public vs private healthcare, you should look at Medicare Advantage vs Original Medicare. When you turn 65, you have the option to enroll either in &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, which is what we usually think of when we talk about &quot;single payer healthcare in America&quot;, or you can enroll in Medicare Advantage (aka Medicare &quot;Part C&quot;), where the premiums that would go to the CMS instead go to private insurers like Humana, United, Oscar Health, Aetna, Clover, etc. These plans replace Original Medicare, also cover Part D prescription drug benefits, and often include supplemental benefits that Original Medicare doesn&#x27;t already cover. There are some interesting findings so far:<p>- 39% of Medicare beneficiaries are on private Medicare Advantage plans instead of the public &quot;Original Medicare&quot;. Because everyone is entitled to &quot;Original Medicare&quot;, this is purely voluntary. This number has been growing so rapidly, that we expect by 2025, more seniors to be on a private plan than the public one. There&#x27;s also great variance by State. In Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Alabama, Hawaii, and Connecticut — nearly 50% of beneficiaries are on Medicare Advantage. By 2022, we expect more seniors in those States to be on a private plan than a public one. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;a-dozen-facts-about-medicare-advantage-in-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;a-dozen-facts-about...</a><p>- For most beneficiaries, Medicare Advantage costs about 39% less than Original Medicare. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-costs-40-less-than-fee-for-service-medicare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-...</a><p>- Medicare Advantage plans are, on average, of higher quality than the public Original Medicare. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-enrollment-quality-continue-upward-trend" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;medicare-advantage-...</a><p>- In Urban areas, Medicare Advantage costs less per capita to administer than Medicare — and that&#x27;s not including the extra Medicare Part D insurance that you would have to buy if you&#x27;re on the Original Medicare plan. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jan&#x2F;does-medicare-advantage-cost-less-traditional-medicare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2...</a>')
