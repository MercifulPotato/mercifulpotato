Obviously isolation will be detrimental to many, but where would you even begin to put a number on it?<p>Even more difficult, there are counterbalancing factors to mass quarantine such as a reduction in traffic fatalities. This one could maybe be estimated up front because we do have some statistics and models around traffic deaths.<p>Coronavirus is a unique situation because the negative effects are very non-linear. The fatality rate will skyrocket if&#x2F;when hospital capacity is overwhelmed. Many policy decisions have been made in order to avoid those non-linear scenarios, which can look like overkill if you only consider them in the context of having avoided those scenarios.<p>But the real problems come from the political maneuvering that this opens up. Once you open the door to unmeasurable or unpredictable possible downsides of a policy, you will be flooded with &quot;think of the children&quot; type appeals that use fear of &quot;what if&quot; scenarios to grind progress to a halt. At scale, there is no such thing as a possible that doesn&#x27;t have downsides to someone, somewhere. Trying to mitigate any and every downside is impossible.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve been shocked and saddened at the unwillingness of pro-lock-down people to consider the unintended consequences<p>Frankly, I think the average person doesn&#x27;t fall into all out &quot;anti-mask&quot; or &quot;pro-lockdown&quot; categories, despite what you see on the news. We only hear about these extremist positions because the extremist voices tend to be the loudest. When considering one&#x27;s own position, it&#x27;s tempting to only look at the most extreme examples from the &quot;other side&quot; because they&#x27;re the easiest to dismiss. In reality, the vast majority of the population is firmly in the middle. The average person doesn&#x27;t like the idea of extreme lockdowns any more than they like the idea of a total laissez faire approach. We just don&#x27;t hear about the middle ground on the news or social media because it&#x27;s boring.')
