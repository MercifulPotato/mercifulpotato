It&#x27;s not as common now, partly because UK orgs put pressure on Google to fix it.<p>Here&#x27;s an example:<p>[change name deed poll]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;search?sxsrf=ALeKk00J9KQR_SH1ZlvHgiu5F9t3Ymt2yg%3A1610900470220&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=9mMEYK__CuPogwfNs4joAg&amp;q=change+name+by+deed+poll&amp;oq=change+name+&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgAMgUIABDJAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoICAAQsQMQgwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOggILhCxAxCDAToOCC4QsQMQgwEQxwEQowI6AgguOgUIABCxAzoFCC4QsQM6CAgAELEDEMkDUKwLWOIYYL0taABwAHgAgAFfiAHjB5IBAjEymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;sclient=psy-ab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F;search?sxsrf=ALeKk00J9KQR_SH1ZlvHgi...</a><p>For me the top four links are clearly marked ads. (Although some people may miss that [ad] marker).  After the ads there are two links to the proper gov.uk website.  Then there&#x27;s a link to a commercial site called &quot;Deed Poll Office&quot;, who charge for a services that&#x27;s free.<p>In the past that TheDeedPollOffice link ranked higher.<p>Similar things used to happen for passports and tax self assessment.')
