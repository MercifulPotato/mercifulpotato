Hell even if you have it in CPU, you probably want it sat on the PCI-E bus anyways so it can P2P DMA with other hardware.<p>Also (not disagreeing but I&#x27;m curious), last time I checked FPGAs could pull off some level of partial reconfiguration in the millisecond and sub millisecond ranges. I may be a bit off on these times but I saw them in a research paper a few years back. What types of speed would be necessary for CPUs to actually be able to benefit from a small FPGA onboard (rather than on an expansion card) with all the context switching.')
