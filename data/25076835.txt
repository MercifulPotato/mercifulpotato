But as you say a payment right now is just moving bits.  The main reason why cards charge so much is due to Risk.  If you read about &quot;interchange fees&quot; you will see how Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, etc. classify different cards into different levels and charge a different exchange rate for each of them.<p>But the thing is, this system and networks were created last century (around 1960) and nowadays there is better technology to assess risk and to perform the transactions.')
