There will be sadly many systems that will never receive this update.<p>But for a fun fact, if you see many embedded systems that say they can only support an SD card up to 32 GB, it is a soft limitation due to the fact that media over 32 GB are pre-formatted to exFAT (and the system lacks support for exFAT). FAT32 can go up to 2 TB. So I have found that reformatting a larger media back to FAT32 makes it recognizable to that system with all of the storage space.')
