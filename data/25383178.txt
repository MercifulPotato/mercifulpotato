Why should the fire safety regulations for a hotel be dramatically different in expense than the ones for the equivalent apartment complex?<p>&gt; They are increasing demand in the same way more and bigger roads do not reduce but instead increase traffic.<p>People consistently get this wrong. Bigger roads don&#x27;t increase traffic. Congestion <i>suppresses</i> traffic. If there is a congested two lane road because it&#x27;s carrying traffic that would require a four lane road, so then you build a four lane road, you then discover that the four lane road is still congested. Because once you remove some of the congestion, the demand it had been suppressing comes back and you still don&#x27;t have enough capacity.<p>The distinction is important because there is a point at which you actually have enough road capacity to satisfy the demand that exists when it isn&#x27;t being suppressed by traffic congestion. It&#x27;s just more than you might have expected based on the amount of traffic observed when the road was congested.<p>&gt; In addition to that they can ignore zoning laws and therefore move rent prices up in areas where hotels are not allowed to be.<p>The solution to which is to eliminate restrictive zoning like that, so that supply can respond to demand.<p>The primary reason that short-term rentals are zoned differently is local regulatory capture by hotels to limit competition and keep prices high. Without restrictive zoning, short-term rentals don&#x27;t have to come at the expense of long-term housing because you can build more housing and have both.')
