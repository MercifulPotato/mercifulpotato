The default fonts (on Windows) were beautifully manually hinted to give a really crisp results without font smoothing.  But manual font hinting is super expensive, so web fonts don&#x27;t do it.  If you disable them, I&#x27;m sure the system has to fall back to the (higher quality) defaults.<p>Most web fonts are automatically hinted, so they only look acceptable with font smoothing on (at normal font sizes with normal DPIs).  If you turn smoothing off, the fonts look super ugly with all kinds of artifacts like weird double-thick lines.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to disable web fonts because I hate font smoothing (to me it&#x27;s just blurry, not smooth), but the issue I&#x27;ve run into is the fad of using a custom font for icons, so I end up getting lots of unicode tofu for graphics (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FakeUnicode&#x2F;status&#x2F;1194628430559469568" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FakeUnicode&#x2F;status&#x2F;1194628430559469568</a>).')
