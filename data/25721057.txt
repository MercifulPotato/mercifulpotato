My job title is Software Developer but most of the time I&#x27;m convincing other developer teams to share code to speed up development, inventing simple solutions to complicated sounding wishes of product management, helping project management to prioritize low effort features and trying to find out what the customers really need.<p>The only problem is that there is no leverage or scale because the software is coupled to physical goods, which means no big profits to pay above average salary and no career progression.<p>And that is the point where I don&#x27;t agree with the article. I don&#x27;t see the correlation between salary and autonomy.')
