It might or might not hurt you long term. For a year or two it won&#x27;t make much a difference, but longer than that and it will hurt you.<p>As a student we understand that sometimes you get pushed into less desirable roles just because that is all you can get.  However make sure your resume and cover letters in the future make it clear where you want to go. When doing hiring people assume that what you have done before is what you want to do, so make sure that even if the support is the majority of your duties your resume only lists it as a small part of your duties, and once you have a better job drop it off.<p>Remember, all jobs have a part that you don&#x27;t like.  Be aware that you may discover that you hate programming for a living and want to get back to support. You never know what the real world is like until you have been in it for 10 years.')
