I live in Los Angeles, which is a city that feels like it&#x27;s trapped in the 1990s. Our highways were never finished and the city is fundamentally crippled as a result. We are building rail faster than any other city but it&#x27;s still far too little and much too late, and what we do build is littered with compromises and further issues that hobble its utility, such as a failure to develop grade separations, until the project is redone entirely. The local government is corrupt. The FBI is indicting councilmen and city hall officials left and right. We are zoned for a smaller population than we were in the 1920s, with 4x the population living here today compared to the 1920s.<p>This isn&#x27;t just LA. Development across the U.S. over the past 20 years has been largely stagnant, and this is reflective in our huge shortage of housing supply that has come to bite us in the rear in recent decades with homes increasingly out of reach for working people, not just in California, but increasingly in flyover places like Idaho and Ohio too.<p>Of course, maybe it&#x27;s the U.S. that is 30 years behind the western world.')
