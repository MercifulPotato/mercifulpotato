As I said in another comment, it&#x27;s a shame we don&#x27;t fully utilize our hardware and instead throw away our gains by piling on more useless abstractions in the name of &quot;human experience&quot;. Spoiler alert, other languages can have good UX and still be fast, like Rust with algebraic data types, modern C++ with auto pointers, Haskell despite its garbage collected nature, Nim which is like a compiled Python, or hell, even Crystal which is like a compiled Ruby.')
