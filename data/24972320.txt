Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[24976643], score=None, time=1604346496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958743, text='&gt; The reason that junk like flat design and derivatives like Material Design are awful for usability has nothing to do with being old and everything to do with being unpredictable.<p>I&#x27;m surprised to see you mentioning the flat design trend as something you consider &quot;old&quot; in any way. I see it as a fad that is past its peak but still far too prevalent to regard as being <i>in the past</i>. And when I was talking about platform native UI conventions, I definitely had older stuff in mind than Windows 8.<p>&gt; Well, firstly, a testing methodology is literally the opposite of worthless if it gives you an objective measure of the increased financial value generated by a change under consideration.<p>See, this is the biggest problem here. I&#x27;m talking about usability and value <i>to the user</i>. You&#x27;re talking about optimizing the UI to exploit the users for <i>your</i> maximum profit. Those two motivations are obviously not well-aligned, and if you&#x27;re on the side of that divide where the ad-tech stuff is, then you&#x27;re not even trying to have the same conversation I&#x27;m having. Your incentives are to maximize the user&#x27;s engagement with your product, so of course you don&#x27;t care about how well it fits into their multitasking workflow; you want to monopolize the user&#x27;s time.')
