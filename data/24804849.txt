I am very much biased in favour of Nim here, but to me in general a non-GC&#x27;d language seems like overkill for web development. So I would rule those languages out straight away.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to Elixir, likely the main difference will be the lack of a mature Django-like framework. I&#x27;m assuming that Elixir has one, whereas Nim doesn&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re looking for a fun project, I would love to see that made for Nim and happy to give pointers if you need them :)')
