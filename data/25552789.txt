Item(by='Moodles', descendants=None, kids=[25556616, 25552918], score=None, time=1609091652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552703, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t it more likely that these super-successful companies use these interviews because they end up hiring the people they want to hire...?<p>I’m not sure it’s that these companies only hire the people they want to hire. It’s probably that highly successful companies know their interview methods don’t work 100% of the time, but they’re willing to tolerate the false negatives of not hiring a few good people if it means all those they do hire meet some minimum standards. And their current system is the best they know how to do.<p>We arrogantly post on Hacker News: “Oh look, this interview method sucks! It will miss out on this great candidate!”.  Ok then, make your own trillion dollar company with  a better interview method that filters out the hordes of bullshit artists while simultaneously never missing out on the best people. Filtering out the bullshit artists is more important than hiring every single productive person. In fact, if you hire too many bullshit artists, all the good people will get fed up and leave anyway.')
