Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=[25217721, 25217498], score=None, time=1606367537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217024, text='&quot;Hit piece&quot; is in and of itself a framing that clearly has a bias toward one side. Was the reporting from multiple outlets on Theranos a series of hit pieces? They were all negative, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they were <i>wrong.</i><p>Coinbase has preemptively presented their side of the story in an effort to make us all say &quot;oh, yeah, that&#x27;s the hit piece we were warned about,&quot; but we haven&#x27;t actually seen the other side of the story yet.')
