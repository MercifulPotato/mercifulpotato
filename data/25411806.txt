Attacking a core business problem from a new angle that no one else sees and designing a revolutionary approach to solving it that saves everyone time, money, and reduces stress is very common. Some examples of this from my previous job:<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CaperAi&#x2F;branchpoke" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CaperAi&#x2F;branchpoke</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CaperAi&#x2F;bazel_compose" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CaperAi&#x2F;bazel_compose</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CaperAi&#x2F;pronto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CaperAi&#x2F;pronto</a><p>These were the ones that were easy to pluck from my job&#x27;s monorepo and generally applicable.<p>As someone who is leaving a small startup <i>for</i> Google I can also add that it&#x27;s one of the biggest compensation-y things in the offer. My manager seems supportive of 20%ing, the project I&#x27;m on is an offshoot of a 20% project, and the skip level I spoke to supported the idea of building tools.<p>So... From a management perspective the startups I&#x27;ve worked for have lost a senior engineer to another company more supportive of personal projects. This is very expensive as 1 senior engineer could represent 10%-40% of your eng team capacity at a small company. So, even just as an employee retention mechanism 20% of a salary spent on retaining your core engineering team and, possibly, obtaining huge benefits to overall company productivity is a worthy trade.')
