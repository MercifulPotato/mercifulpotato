Maybe some highly specific noise in the environment that happens to resonate with the signal structure?<p>Alternatively there might be protocols which have mandatory encryption as part of their specification.  Or you might be using a combined encryption-authentication mode, but only for the purpose of authentication on ham radio.<p>Those are all a bit of a stretch though.')
