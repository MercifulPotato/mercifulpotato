I don&#x27;t know anyone on Wall Street... is his level of intellect common among investment bankers and such there?<p>Investment banker here.. &quot;Wall Street&quot; is a pretty big concept, not unlike &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.<p>So in the best banks and the best groups, yes â€“ I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s among the very best, but there are plenty of similarly smart people around.<p>Having said that, I obviously have no insight into whether he was actually good at all the other things that make a great &quot;banker&quot;. To stick to the same analogy, one can be a prolific coder but be absolutely terrible about writing docs and tests, keeping a sane git workflow, prioritizing, communicating, being a team player, etc.')
