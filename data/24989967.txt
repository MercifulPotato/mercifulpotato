It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>The contention is mostly in a small number of states where the Republican party has engineered electoral corruption in order to retain control, combined with the winner-take-all nature of electoral votes in most states. Most states conduct elections with few problems and little drama.<p>If the president were elected by popular vote at the national level there would be far less contention because the margin in any given local election would be much less meaningful.')
