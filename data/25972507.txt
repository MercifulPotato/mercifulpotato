This is <i>extremely unlikely</i> to get margin called. Even if it does, you&#x27;re up.<p>If you buy a $10 stock on margin, and it drops to $5 (even if just temporarily), you owe Robinhood $10 secured by a $5 stock, which puts them in a riskier position, and may margin-call to cut their losses. You get the $5 from the sale, but still owe Robinhood the initial $10.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can see how this can compound to amplify drops if a large number of people have bought the <i>same thing</i>, all on margin, and it starts dropping for whatever reason.<p>Edit: Follow-on<p>This is particularly &quot;bad&quot; if your goal was to &quot;own the stock&quot; (at pretty much any price) just so that someone else can&#x27;t buy it.')
