It&#x27;s a completely different ecosystem. My personal theory is the stuff that kills us, usually will also kill an animal, so the really deadly fungi and bacteria usually don&#x27;t form until after the animal has died and the immune system has stopped functioning. That&#x27;s why raw meat from a fresh kill is generally safe but if the meat is left alone for too long it becomes poisonous.')
