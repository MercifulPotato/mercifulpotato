Your comment made me realise that I failed to point out an important underlying argument of the article: Product Roadmaps ≠ Release Plans.<p>Goal of a roadmap = Communicate the most important objectives for the product team (therefore should be based on and closely tied to the company’s strategy)<p>Goal of a release plan = Communicate what features are being release next and when, so that other functions can plan accordingly<p>Only both of them together provide a comprehensive view over what the product team is working on. What most stakeholders need to know is “What comes next” and “when”, so they can plan their work accordingly. So the mistake we (Product Managers) make is to start putting feature requests and due dates on our strategic roadmap. And this is exactly where the problems with roadmaps are created, as described in the first part of the article.<p>With regards to putting “all the things in the roadmap that people want to hear, forget about it, and continue working on what you were working on.”, I would strongly advise against that for three reasons:\n(1) It encourages Design by Committee\n(2) The other teams will have a hard time trusting a product team that puts their requests on the roadmap but consistently fails to deliver on them. It’s better to create a shared understanding of where their requests fit in the overall strategy.\n(3) And, as redwood pointed it, it poses the risk that sales will sell roadmap commitments that you can never deliver on, which decreases trust with customers.<p>Curious to hear: How would you expect the product team to communicate their objectives and progress to the rest of the organisation?')
