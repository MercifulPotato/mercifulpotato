Designing the program conceptually. This might involve whiteboarding, architecture overviews, design review, sketches, etc<p>2. Actually writing a working program<p>Writing good code is expensive and time consuming, so you want to bring any eureka refactoring &#x2F; design moments as early as possible in order to decrease how much useless code you write. And for that you need to spend time nurturing the design in your head. Make prototypes. Test the database you&#x27;re thinking of using. Make a simple in-memory prototype of the difficult logic. Make wireframes. Mine all that for clear headedness - you want a low risk, obvious road to tread when you build.')
