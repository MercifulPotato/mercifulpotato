That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re reading from comments like mine and the one you dismissed and judged so easily without informing yourself.<p>I&#x27;ve been &quot;tracking this issue&quot; and &quot;digging into the details of it&quot; because I&#x27;m a pornhub performer who has had payment issues since earlier this year when this campaign kicked off out of nowhere. My partner and I went through Pornhub&#x27;s verification process (for which we uploaded current government issued IDs and signed forms, and were initially rejected and had to appeal). My partner and I have millions of video views in the last year, and yet despite the fun and monetary benefit of it all, I happen to view myself as a good person who is conscious of how my actions can impact others negatively, often unwittingly. So I&#x27;ve naturally wondered whether I should ethically be involved with Pornhub at all.<p>So apologies for my snark, but this campaign is not rational, and me and others like me are fatigued at those jumping to all sorts of non-sequitur conclusions based on fearmongering which is in turn based on shoddy (and at times obviously manipulated) statistics. Even IF pornhub had a verification issue (which will never be perfect), it is not AT ALL clear who has responsibility in this new age of information sharing, how morality should be controlled (god I hope it&#x27;s obvious it shouldn&#x27;t be controlled by finance execs), etc. Who is financing the campaign against Pornhub?<p>Dig into this campaign and it&#x27;s obvious it&#x27;s not motivated by sound understanding and reason and has its roots in religiously affiliated action groups.')
