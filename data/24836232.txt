I see these reports come up regularly about 9X% being covered by fiber and yet every building I lived in and visited in London, except for one, did not have fiber available. Same experience for coworkers and friends so it&#x27;s not just me.<p>I honestly wonder who makes these reports and how they come to these figures? They&#x27;re pulling numbers out of their ass.<p>About 4g, I tried it once 3 years ago and it was really bad. The speed was no better than copper (the tower wasn&#x27;t close enough sadly) and it had issues during peak times (evening 6 to 10 pm is the worst), I assume because of serious contention and oversubscribing. I think mobile is a perfect example of something that&#x27;s great when it works (right time right place) and that&#x27;s terrible when it doesn&#x27;t. Considering that I depend on internet for my job, I&#x27;d rather have ADSL that works 100% of the time even if it&#x27;s slower in average.')
