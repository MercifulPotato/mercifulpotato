There are some truly baffling performance regressions in Xcode over the last years. Like starting for the first time into the debugger taking almost half a minute.<p>&gt; If Xcode is too slow, users will stop using it and prefer alternatives that provide the performance that we want.<p>There are no alternatives if you want to build iOS applications. You&#x27;ll at least need to use the Xcode command line tools for this, and some of the performance problems (like the slow start into the debugger) seem to be rooted there, because VSCode has the same problem.')
