It&#x27;s quite involved and not absolutely perfect yet, but it has some features I haven&#x27;t yet seen on other DEs like being able to swipe horizontally on your touchpad to <i>smoothly</i> switch workspaces (following your fingers) and the satisfaction of having it properly configured is pretty high.<p>There have been 3 issues I&#x27;ve had regarding it, 2 I&#x27;d call minor:<p>- I haven&#x27;t found a way to rearrange external displays, though it is theoretically supported<p>- After a bug in my TV switching to the lowest possible resolution through switching the input in home assistant it would not work with 4K again until after a complete reboot (so it may not even be a wlroots issue)<p>- XWayland apps are unresponsive in the upper half of the second screen (4K at 1x scaling)<p>Using mostly native Wayland apps neither of these have been deal breakers for me. Something under-discussed is that virtual desktops are per-screen, which I find quite cool.<p>So that&#x27;s my adventure with Wayfire, but I would assume that Gnome and KDE have perfected multi-screen usage on and off of Wayland by now.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wayfire.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wayfire.org&#x2F;</a>')
