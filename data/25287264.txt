I was in the pipeline with Apple recently, and the pay for a sr. eng position was 80k. This is comparable to other companies where I interviewed. Of course, without receiving a solid offer I didn&#x27;t hear about the RSU side, but I think your experience moving internally is totally different to starting a role with FAANG within EU.')
