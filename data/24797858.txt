I suspect that parts of it are 3D printed because of the difficulties in machining the shapes necessary. That may make it worthwhile to use lower-strength 3D technology and compensate by having more weight, but I&#x27;m just speculating.<p>I&#x27;d love to just set one of those engines on a bench and take it apart.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see von Braun&#x27;s turbo-pump innovation is still the go-to technology after nearly 90 years. Also the fuel pre-heater used as the nozzle cooler.')
