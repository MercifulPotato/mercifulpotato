From what I understand and can gather from tech talks from large firms, it is common (up to and beyond petabyte scale) to use ceph clusters purely consisting of SSDs and HDDs (no tape) to store mission critical data, with cache tiering used to balance hot and cold data. AFAIK, because of their self-healing nature thanks to replication&#x2F;erasure coding algorithms, all that needs to be done is replace corrupted drives periodically, thus making tape drives non-essential unless periodic full backups are required for off-site storage. Please feel free to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong in any of this. Thanks.')
