They both major focuses on professional ethics and use their power to enforce those ethics, both by being able to bargain with corporations or the government and by holding power over their members. Getting disbarred is the end of your career as a lawyer, and so it behooves you to comply with their ethical standards even if you don&#x27;t personally care about them.<p>It&#x27;s a little harder for programmers because the ethical bar is less agreed-upon. &quot;Doctors should help people&quot; and &quot;lawyers shouldn&#x27;t steal their client&#x27;s money&quot; are pretty nearly 100% agreed-upon by the professionals, but there&#x27;s still a lot of disagreement on what is and isn&#x27;t ethical for a programmer to do.')
