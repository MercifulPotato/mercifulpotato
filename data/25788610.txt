People can upload their data (csv, json) via the user interface and choose the columns that would represent their x and y fields and then they would have a visualization of their choice. They can choose between different chart types e.g line, pie or bar charts. Also, the service has support for APIs that developers can use to remotely generate data visualizations. I&#x27;m at the point where I move hosting providers and set up the new domain name. Once I&#x27;m good to go, I would come back here and show it to the guys.')
