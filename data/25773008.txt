We have been known to punt an issue to let us all collect our thoughts.<p>I know the system keeps me from micro-managing, keeps one of my guys from just complaining (we ask for a potential solution), and keeps another employee from feeling un-empowered.<p>The only bad second-order effect I&#x27;ve seen is sometimes people wait to fix simple problems - they tend to it in the system instead of just fixing it.<p>But... Usually I&#x27;m wrong, the issue usually is deeper upon reflection.')
