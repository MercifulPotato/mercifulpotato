Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608070482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435681, text='<i>&gt; The majority of the surplus goes to the consumer, yes.</i><p>Which is <i>different</i> from what the author says--and at least it is usually correct, whereas what the author says is simply wrong. It is not true that in a competitive market there is no surplus.<p>What <i>is</i> true is that in a competitive market, price gets driven down to marginal cost, and there is usually no opportunity for the seller to practice price discrimination, so everyone pays the same price for the product--not just the marginal buyer, for whom the product is <i>just</i> worth what it costs, but also all the non-marginal buyers, for whom the product is worth <i>more</i> than what it costs (in the sense that they would still buy the product even if the price were higher). The extra worth of the product to all of those non-marginal buyers is the surplus, and without price discrimination, the seller has no way of capturing any of it, so there is little or no margin for the seller.<p><i>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure how the author puts a value on someone else&#x27;s preference for a view.</i><p>He&#x27;s assuming that those people would be willing to pay some amount to have the tunneling done and thereby avoid having to see rails. That amount, that they would be willing to pay but which the owner of the rail has no way of capturing from them, is the surplus. Here the author is using the concept of &quot;surplus&quot; correctly; unfortunately, in many other places in the article he doesn&#x27;t. He also, as you point out, has a misguided fondness for central planning.')
