Which was fine when I didn&#x27;t WFH more than a few days a month.<p>But I could easily solve that by moving to a cheaper area where I could get a house with enough space for a dedicated home office. But to do that I need to be confident WFH will continue. Hard to predict what to do.<p>(So what I&#x27;ve done in the interim is lease a small office walking distance from my house, lots of vacancies right now.)')
