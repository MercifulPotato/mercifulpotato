Sure the kernel or u-boot that ship with them might be slightly older but sources have always been available.<p>And TI are quite decent at contributing to the upstream kernel and u-boot trees.  Generally only a few months after a new TI SoC is announced there&#x27;s enough support in the upstream u-boot and kernel to boot the board and do some useful things.  Generally by the time silicon is buyable by mere mortals mainline is in pretty decent shape.')
