No idea what mobile looks like.<p>Next to the search box, it states that this is by a data scientist. If that is in any way relevant other than in the sense &quot;this is by a smart person&quot;, what it means to me is that there is a massive amount of data here which is intelligently filtered and subject to a decent quality search.<p>The Venn diagram on the left promises good results, eliminating the problem that good, cheap items are needles in haystacks, buried in fake reviews.<p>Turns out that the data scientist is just writing consumer education advice columns and reviewing some products he has not actually tried himself.<p>E.g. 4K projectors:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodcheapandfast.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;best-4k-projectors?rq=projector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodcheapandfast.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;best-4k-projectors...</a><p>There is no way he owns all of those. I would much rather read the Amazon reviews or whatever from people that bought those things, especially from people who had issues. That&#x27;s in spite of the issue of fake reviews; oh well.')
