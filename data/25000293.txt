Has anyone put this into practice?<p><i>Imagine that we lived in such a world: wifi repeaters would just be IPv6 routers. So would wifi access points. So would ethernet switches. So would SDN. ARP storms would be gone. &quot;IGMP snooping bridges&quot; would be gone. Bridging loops would be gone. Every routing problem would be traceroute-able. And best of all, we could drop 12 bytes (source&#x2F;dest ethernet addresses) from every ethernet packet, and 18 bytes (source&#x2F;dest&#x2F;AP addresses) from every wifi packet. Sure, IPv6 adds an extra 24 bytes of address (vs IPv4), but you&#x27;re dropping 12 bytes of ethernet, so the added overhead is only 12 bytes - pretty comparable to using two 64-bit IP addresses but having to keep the ethernet header. The idea that we could someday drop ethernet addresses helped to justify the oversized IPv6 addresses.</i><p><i>It would have been beautiful. Except for one problem: it never happened.</i>')
