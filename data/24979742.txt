We had a market economy for a very long time, even in the middle ages. Actually Ludwig von Mises describes this barter based market economies perfect (but fails to understand capitalism).<p>Capitalism, that we have have since more or less 150 years requires the pre financing on a huge scale of industrial production. This requires debt that can only be, due to interest, paid back with growth.<p>There can&#x27;t be a capitalist economy without growth by definition. From the link given by me:<p>&quot;One big issue with even trying to stair-step fossil fuel use is the fact that our financial system needs growth to keep from collapsing. In order to pay back debt with interest, it is necessary to have economic growth, and financial growth and growth in fossil fuel use are very closely tied. Economic growth can be 2% or 3% above fossil fuel use growth because of efficiency gains, and economic growth in a particular country can be higher than that of world economic growth because of greater outsourcing of manufacturing to other countries. There was even a gain in the late 70s and early 80s, as we picked the low-hanging efficiency fruit and switched to using nuclear. But overall, there is no evidence that fossil fuel use, or even oil use, can be divorced from economic growth. If there is a big decline in fossil fuel use, it will translate to a decline in economic growth.<p>The need for economic growth in order to pay back debt even applies to our money supply itself. Money is loaned into existence. This happens when a commercial bank makes a loan and deposit at the same time. The problem is that when the money is created, not enough money is loaned into existence to pay back the interest as well.  So economic growth is needed to create the additional money so that the debt can be paid back with interest.<p>Because of this issue, a Steady State Economy (economy without growth) requires a financial system with virtually no debt. It might be possible to have a little debt, but its use would be primarily to facilitate short-term transactions. Debt jubilees at regular intervals might be needed, to keep people from building up much debt.&quot;')
