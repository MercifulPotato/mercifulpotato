It&#x27;s not helpful.<p>So, no don&#x27;t tell people to ignore long term planning otherwise people who give you money are going to stop giving you money to &quot;build, demo and decide&quot;. Unless you&#x27;re on your own dime (e.g. you pay yourself or are self funded), then I wouldn&#x27;t take this advice.')
