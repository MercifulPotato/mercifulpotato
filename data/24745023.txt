They had some nice red a couple of years ago. They had a red&#x2F;black paint scheme for their GTi models. And a special blue (or was it a goldish yellow?) for their 208 EV. Not that a lot of people buy them, so... Which is a shame if you ask me. Heck, even Jaguar got rid of British Racing Green from their standard catalogue last time I checked...')
