And Jobs absolutely expected iOS devices to eventually replace full computers for most people; as he put it, everyone needs a car but only a few need a truck.<p>Where I absolutely agree with you is that under Jobs, there were no attempts to make macOS behave more like a car. Lion did borrow a handful of visual elements from iOS, but it was mostly aesthetic. Jobs was also on medical leave for much of Lion&#x27;s development cycle, so I wonder if he was less involved.')
