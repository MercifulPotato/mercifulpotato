The agreement Israel signed doesn&#x27;t allow Pfizer any access to the &quot;country&#x27;s health-care database&quot;. That&#x27;s complete nonsense. Nor is there anything even remotely &quot;shady&quot; or &quot;undemocratic&quot; about it.<p>Israel will provide Pfizer daily aggregate data that contains no identifiable health information (as defined by the Israeli Patientâ€™s Rights Law), or any data that may result in the identification of individuals.<p>The signed agreement is publicly available, is under the oversight of Israel&#x27;s Helsinki committee, and is in full compliance with Israeli law. Any citizen who believes their rights are being infringed upon, can petition to the Supreme Court of Israel.<p>The reason Israel was able to reach such an agreement, and the EU wasn&#x27;t, is because Israel, given enough vaccines, will be able to vaccinate its entire adult population by the end of March, whereas the EU isn&#x27;t even close to having such capacity, regardless of vaccine access.')
