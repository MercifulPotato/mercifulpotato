Remember the controversy over LGBT content supposedly being removed or demonitised on YouTube - pretty mucn none of the mainstream discourse agreed with the idea that it wasn&#x27;t censorship because YouTube was a private company, let alone the idea that - as I&#x27;ve seen pushed in other areas - that pressuring YouTube not to do it was actually the real attack on their free speech rights.')
