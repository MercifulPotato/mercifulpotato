It helps by allowing businesses in the chokepoint layer to be price-neutral to other layers above or below them that are commodities (those layers face so much price competition that they have no negotiating power on the other layers) and focus on monopoly strategies against other competitors in the same layer, free of concern about needing to compromise with other layers.')
