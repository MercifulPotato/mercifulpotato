Select all street lights? Then think of how that question could be translated and misread in another language. Then select everything that would qualify as a light on the street: lamps, car headlights, crossing signals, et al.<p>Sometimes I select a square that I think the machine placed in the set to get more certainty but doesn’t match. For example, “select all chimneys”. If it presents me with an image of a house in the distance that has an object infront&#x2F;behind it that is not a chimney but due to positioning and image quality it appears to be a chimney I will select it.<p>Captcha is a game.<p>- For Alphabet&#x2F;Google the game is: mine the public for image recognition data so we can automate a car&#x2F;drone and sell it to said public.<p>- For me the game is: can I play captcha chess with Google’s AI?<p>And if Google flags me as a bot, so what? At any point I know that I can quit playing captcha chess by giving it what it wants for a round or two and I’m trusted again.')
