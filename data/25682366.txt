The fact of the matter is that last mile internet has become more competitive in the past 4 years. The fact of the matter is that most economists are against NN, and those that are for it are only for it because they believe that last mile internet access is monopolistic — something that is increasingly harder to argue.<p>Make a real argument. How is it more efficient to get the government involved? Why does the government have the right to claim authority over privately owned infrastructure? Why now, and if NN is so essential, why did the internet have so little trouble developing over the past 2 decades?<p>No, I’m sorry. I don’t think we should force ISPs to follow rules that would require dramatic overbuilding of their infrastructure. I think we should leave the internet alone.')
