Item(by='ska', descendants=None, kids=[25996325], score=None, time=1612223970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994556, text='I think we&#x27;re down in the weeds here - so I&#x27;ll leave it at this.  I shouldn&#x27;t have focused it on tech so much, other people make the same category of mistake.<p>The assumptions that I am talking about are basically this.  (1) &quot;people can easily do without Facebook&quot;, or the variant that &quot;Facebook isn&#x27;t very important to them&quot;  (2) There are viable replacements available to the people who do value this, at least in their own estimation.<p>Both these assumptions are (empirically) incorrect, at least for many people.  If you reject them both, you are basically saying people are incapable of really knowing their own best interests, which is laughable.  The best you can do is advocate they understand the implications better.<p>Hence this falls in to the category I was drawing, mainly that if you say &quot;People don&#x27;t really need X&quot; and lots of people are at the same time saying &quot;I really need X&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t see a good replacement for X&quot; then you are far more likely to be wrong than they are.<p>You dislike all my examples, try this one &quot;Nobody needs a fossil fuel engine car&quot;.  Obvious, right? Electrics are available and better in every way (just ask your favorite tesla owner).  Telling people they can do fine without FB because you do is a bit like telling them they can do fine without gasoline because you do.  Even when technically true for some values of &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;need&quot;, it&#x27;s not useful.')
