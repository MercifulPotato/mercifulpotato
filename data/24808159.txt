It doesn&#x27;t make sense that some abstract entity can have more legal rights than people. If someone commits a crime, they go to jail and so they cannot continue to harm society. On the other hand, if a corporation commits a crime, they get a fine and keep doing what they were doing. There should be a point beyond which people need to go to jail or the corporation shares need to be seized by the government.<p>There needs to be an incentive for shareholders to dump shares of unethical companies. The government should provide that incentive.')
