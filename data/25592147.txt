I only mention that because one of the trouble&#x27;s with hydrogen is transportation, so they must have found at least some solutions, might be worth checking out for anyone interested.<p>In this same city, the steel plant will exceed it&#x27;s emissions limits for this year, and so the hope is to see a hydrogen process start taking replacing the current coal process soon.<p>The hydrogen plant is also supplying a mix of hydrogen and natural gas to the local gas supply, which is pretty rad too. Yet another way hydrogen can help cut reliance on fossil fuels. I don&#x27;t know what the blend&#x27;s carbon output is when burned, but reducing the demand for fossil fuels is a net positive in detering investment into drilling and mining. Having a renewable source for a general combustion gas is excellent.')
