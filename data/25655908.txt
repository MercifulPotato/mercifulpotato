I think he was concerned I spent too much time indoors, and wanted surprise me with an exciting idea. I knew that my dad didn&#x27;t have a lot of money, and I also knew he&#x27;d be angry if he bought the go-kart and I never used it, so I lied and said I didn&#x27;t want one.<p>My point is that there&#x27;s often more going on inside children&#x27;s brains than we realize, even at a young age. The kid could be asking for that present because he thinks it will make his father happy, for example. Just something to think about.')
