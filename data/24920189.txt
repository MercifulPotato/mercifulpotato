Item(by='Nbox9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603900215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24919477, text='&gt; At the moment, the largest tragedy is meat consumption<p>I fully agree, but when discussing the terrible ways we treat animals I often find that people are less willing to listen and think about the suffering of animals when itâ€™s something they themselves are taking active part in.  My goal when writing about animal suffering is to help people acknowledge animal suffering is a bad thing, and to think about under which circumstances we create animal suffering.  If they start thinking that way it can eventually lead to changes in diet.')
