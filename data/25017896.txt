This makes full-stack development a breeze.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a solo project and you&#x27;re not sure if GraphQL is right for you, I would say definitely give it a shot. As with anything it takes a bit to really figure it out in your brain, but once you do, you wont regret it or ever want to look back.')
