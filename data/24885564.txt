I wasn’t able to troubleshoot this with Google tools, and there’s no one to talk to at google.<p>(Worst thing, you get no feedback - except realizing a month later that someone didn’t get an email you sent)<p>I gave up and replaced small ISP with fastmail.<p>My bottom line is that, no you can’t really run your own SMTP server anymore unless google, Microsoft and fastmail let you, by virtue of hoisting 90% of your recipients.')
