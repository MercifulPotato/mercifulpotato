I have always liked the steady improvement openSuse and SuseEL have made over the last 5 years or so. While they are sort of the underdog still (just look at their numbers compared to RH), the fact that at least we have an alternative to RHEL in SEL for when companies require support contracts, is a huge benefit to users. I try not to talk about Canonical for... reasons.<p>As for microOS, I hope that SEL takes it up with a supported version, as I think this sort of &quot;heres a small, minimal OS suited well to being treated as cattle&quot; approach still has lots of mindshare to capture (soorry alpine, I&#x27;ll stick to gnuland!), and a large part of that mindshare is in corporations. Although, that said, I do find myself pondering nix and guix a lot more lately than just minimal installs. For some cases I know it&#x27;s a bad idea, but I have settled on rolling release being the better update model for linux when not stopped by business requirements, and the more minimal the install the less likelyhood of rolling release versions having issues, plus that sort of thing should be caught in testing right? Cool stuff, gonna have to give this a space in my vps list.')
