Most games go unnoticed, very few will break even, only &quot;lottery winners&quot; will make real money. The stores are full of well executed games with original ideas that you&#x2F;we never heard about and never will. Games in page 1 of each category will make money, then there is those from page 2 to 10000.<p>We&#x27;ve spend a year and a half building a game that made us just over $1000. You increase your odds by having a name in the industry: known game designer, known franchise, known publisher, something that will put you in the front page of gaming websites for a few hours, but even that is just a push, no guarantees. You can also go for a quantitative strategy: build lot of small simple games. This last strategy worked better for us.<p>Make sure you take this decision knowing that failing is by far the most likely outcome. That&#x27;s the hard truth about the game industry.<p>Sorry if those are not the encouraging words you hoped.')
