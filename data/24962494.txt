Political philosophy is and should be just a tool, to analyze ideas.<p>Your portrayal of Anarchism seems a bit one sided however. There are many areas that can benefit from building on anarchic relationships to some degree, such as free software, foundational research, public service etc. And even on a micro level, in teams, communities that uphold the notion of equality and fluent leadership.<p>So a pacifist implementation is rather about building and maintaining alternative relationships than abolishing existing ones by force.')
