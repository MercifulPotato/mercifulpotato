Since then, 1.3 million people are waiting for emergency humanitarian aid, out of a total population of 6.4 million [0]<p>I&#x27;ll cheerfully point out I don&#x27;t think that Libya is economically competitive, and the slave trade is a big symptom of that.<p>Banning slavery won&#x27;t make them wealthy - they&#x27;ll still probably be starving. Make them wealthy and the slave markets probably go away.<p>Them banning slavery will impress me less than a policy of general liberalisation to get some economic success happening. Economies don&#x27;t grow big by banning stuff; banning stuff happens after the economy is strong enough to handle the damage bans do.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Libya#Economy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Libya#Economy</a>')
