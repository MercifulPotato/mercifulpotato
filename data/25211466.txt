But we also have many small-ish farms being able to provide for their owners. What I find from looking at agriculture is, that regional partnerships (from field to table) esp. in the organic sector help a lot stabilizing the situation.<p>Also forms like Community-supported agriculture seem to be working for some.<p>But - they are not focused and do not produce a specific crop. So not sure how this could work for a marijuana farm like yours.<p>None the less - being a proponent of localized farming and seasonal living, I would love to see some things working out for the likes of you and ensuring a free form of ownership and the ability to provide for you and your family.<p>Others proposed, that &quot;winner takes it all&quot; is a natural law. This would lead me to slavery is a natural law, as the winner would dictate the living conditions of the rest.<p>Absolut freedom (leading to winner takes it all situations) in the beginning (at least for me) necessarily leads to un-freedom for most in the end.\nThis is actually what prompted me to think about different forms of freedom (individual freedom vs. collective freedom, positive freedom (freedom to ...) vs. negative freedom (freedom from ...)).<p>For me this leads to some form of democratic end of freedom. The idea that my freedom ends were yours begins. Something like this. I did a longer post on this - but sadly in German, so it probably does not make too much sense here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schriftrolle.de&#x2F;freiheit-versuch-einer-begriffsklaerung" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schriftrolle.de&#x2F;freiheit-versuch-einer-begriffsklaer...</a>')
