The returns you can get can be ridiculously huge across the entire team compared to the hours you might spend, but I&#x27;ve found many people just aren&#x27;t terribly interested in sitting down and digging into ugly scripts and pushing dozens of commits to figure out what might be slowing things down. And honestly, it&#x27;s not exactly trivial to structure things in a way that&#x27;s simultaneously both efficient and maintainable, especially if you&#x27;re refactoring an existing system instead of starting from scratch, so that can be another turn-off.')
