Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607576816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367376, text='No, the sense of &quot;ex&quot; here is very definitely &quot;bereft of&quot;, and it is specific to financial English. (Why do you think it&#x27;s being contrasted with <i>cum</i>?) Buying ex-dividend means you don&#x27;t get the dividend.<p>It develops, through the phrase &quot;ex-dividend date&quot;, from a special sense of <i>ex</i> in Latin when applied to times, meaning &quot;after&quot;. (You can see exactly the same thing happening in English phrases like &quot;from now on&quot;.) Originally, ex-dividend date referred to a date after the dividend date. This was reanalyzed as referring to a date upon which the instrument becomes &quot;ex-dividend&quot; [nonsensical in Latin], which required a reanalysis of <i>ex</i> as pertaining to the dividend rather than the date.<p>It is an error to talk about translating &quot;Latin <i>ex</i>&quot; here; this isn&#x27;t a Latin <i>ex</i>.')
