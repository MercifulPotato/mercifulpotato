That means, you never invest equity that you need in short-term span. Second, you make sure that your equity investments are diversified. Third, you only make equity investments if you understand - if not, you stick to diversified funds.<p>I&#x27;d like to quote Buffer from his Berkshire Hathway 2013 shareholder letter<p>&gt; Most investors, of course, have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise, they will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.<p>&gt; I have good news for these non-professionals: The typical investor doesn’t need this skill. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts). In the 20th Century, the Dow Jones Industrials index advanced from 66 to 11,497, paying a rising stream of dividends to boot. The 21st Century will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners – neither he nor his “helpers” can do that – but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.<p>&gt; That’s the “what” of investing for the non-professional. The “when” is also important. The main danger is that the timid or beginning investor will enter the market at a time of extreme exuberance and then become disillusioned when paper losses occur. (Remember the late Barton Biggs’ observation: “A bull market is like sex. It feels best just before it ends.”) The antidote to that kind of mistiming is for an investor to accumulate shares over a long period and never to sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. Following those rules, the “know-nothing” investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long- term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;letters&#x2F;2013ltr.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berkshirehathaway.com&#x2F;letters&#x2F;2013ltr.pdf</a>')
