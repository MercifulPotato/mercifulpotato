You deleted your post before I submitted my response but I want to have it here if anyone is interested, since I took the energy to write it:<p>You&#x27;re looking at it in a very limited way. I would say that someone who is happy with their purchase several years down the line is not bamboozled. I am also realistically pretty qualified to think through the economics of it (many years in finance and deep study of Econ.) I am by no means saying &quot;great investment everyone should make&quot; - I am pointing to this being a rather experiential thing.<p>Do you have the same strong reaction to people who invest time and money into &quot;pointless&quot; hobbies, or makes career decisions that don&#x27;t maximize their income? Because I can easily argue that even having a TV-watching (vs study) habit costs you more over your lifetime than the most expensive diamond - yet hardly anyone poo-poos those choices.<p>I also invite you to see whether there are many guys on this thread or in your life who proposed with decently expensive rings and regret it. I am not seeing it. Are you? Otherwise, it seems like you have only analytical experience of the topic while we have both the analytical and experiential (that was the point of my mango analogy) so you may want to recognize you have a limited perspective here.<p>Whether the signaling is outdated and misogynist, I guess you can decide for yourself, but I&#x27;ll have you consider this: while my wife and I are equal in all tangible ways: education, income level, etc. she still absolutely bears most of the risk of pregnancy and birth. Even afterwards, it&#x27;s theoretically easy for me to say &quot;never mind&quot; and reset my life, while she&#x27;s saddled with all the consequences. I recognized that when I was proposing and felt it very heavily, and on some level the ring does speak to an investment and commitment from my part. I don&#x27;t think my wife gave it that level of analysis but I bet this is at least some of the history behind the &quot;burden of proof&quot; being on the guy.<p>I am by no means saying everyone has to do it this way - there are tons of different attitudes and approaches people can take, and here&#x27;s ours. And by the way, it&#x27;s far from uncommon. EG: I have worked in finance, with some very high powered women who were certainly not reliant on any guy for anything - but they universally had nice diamond bands on their hands.')
