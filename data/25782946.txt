Item(by='kls', descendants=None, kids=[25783331], score=None, time=1610660169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25781434, text='I think you are off base on this, I think there is a small contingent of the far right that are white identity adherents. The rest get labeled in with them, because they have not been vocal in their distancing themselves from that contingent, thus groups like the Proud Boys get lumped in with the white supremacist&#x27;s and white identity adherents. While the Proud Boy&#x27;s are a radical alt-right group, white identify is not their binding fabric. The embracing of masculinity is, they have member from all races and explicitly call out that they are not a white nationalist organization. The alt-right is a coalition, of the fringe just like the far-left. Most tolerate each other under enemy-of-my-enemy mentality.')
