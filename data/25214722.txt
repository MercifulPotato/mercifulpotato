It could help keep alive niche commercial software that has been left behind by platform changes. For example, there&#x27;s an old speech synthesizer, ETI-Eloquence, that some blind people love. It was developed in the late 90s to early 2000s, acquired (a few times, ultimately by Nuance), and now seems to be basically dead. There was an Android version, but that had to be discontinued due to the recent requirement that native code on Android must be 64-bit. CheerpX, combined with a non-browser-based wasm runtime, could revive it!')
