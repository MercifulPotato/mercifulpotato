The UK has really gone all in on psychosocial nudge tactics in this pandemic, and it has massively failed so far. Arguably, they&#x27;ve done so because they knew the population were so belligerent and arrogantly ignorant that a more direct approach would definitely fail. They have leveraged the &#x27;new variant&#x27; to implement at the last moment the measures that were being recommended for months by all their expert committees. People here don&#x27;t want to be told what to do and there are very well organised efforts to encourage people to feel empowered in their ignorance and irresponsibility. The &#x27;people in charge&#x27; aren&#x27;t the only ones to blame for that.')
