And I have opened some of them. The tone of the videos are bit off for me. He has some photo copyed written notes that everyone does in colleges in India. Needless to say I never could go beyond these display of notes.<p>After doing all these programming videos, he then started doing laptop recommendations and what not. But I never expected this.
