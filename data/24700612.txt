I need to build a very simple website for personal usage with:<p>- Password-protected login to hide every single page behind<p>- A single sqlite database with possibly a single table (maybe a second single-line table to store my login + pw-hash + salt)<p>- A single page to upload stuff to the database. Some kind of asynchronous JS instead of HTML forms may be preferred.<p>- A single page that always shows the same database query<p>- Very infrequent access to the site (not more than once per day)<p>- There&#x27;s basically zero chance that this would grow to something bigger. Maybe just extend the site functionality to allow my wife to also use it, and maybe find a way to interact with it from command line on Linux (but probably by doing HTTPS requests).<p>I did something like this with PHP back in 2007, but I know PHP is not very recommended. I worry that trying to learn a whole framework like Ruby on Rails or Django may be overkill. I really like Ruby as a programming language (although I never used RoR), so sticking with it would be cool, but Dreamhost says I should avoid it since it uses use too much memory and I&#x27;m on a shared plan. I also have some experience with cgi-bin in python, but I&#x27;m also told cgi-bin should be avoided just like PHP. I&#x27;m also aware that I could use some sort of server-side javascript, but there are a trillion frameworks to choose from.<p>What would you use today? What would you recommend?')
