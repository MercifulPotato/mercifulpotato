The Beyond Visual Line of Site issue still seems like a blocker to real adoption and with no real path forward yet.  It baffles me that the airspace up to 200’ above private property can’t be BVLOS for the owner.  This would enable advances in agriculture, construction, security, ranching, utility inspections, and certainly many more areas.<p>Additionally, the idea that the FEDs can manage all this is insane.  Drones are not airlines, where a city 30k’ below a flight path shouldn’t have a say in the flight.  If drone flights take off, land, or transits a cities boundaries, that city should be more involved than the FEDs, who should just manage overall safety and compliance.  The future of drones and beyond visual line of sight over other people&#x27;s property will be more akin to cars, the DMV, and public roads, than to aircraft, airlines, and the ATC.  It will require a ton of local involvement, which, unfortunately, the major corporate players focused on delivery don’t want.')
