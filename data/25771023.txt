Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25774550], score=None, time=1610590947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766504, text='&gt;<i>Even the readers of HN do not owe the blog writers anything, nor are they beholden to them to give them the votes&#x2F;comments they like.</i><p>The difference being authors and posts can exist without caring about HN, but HN can&#x27;t exist without content to link to. So I&#x27;d say the reverse is not true, except to individual authors. Authors dont owe HN anything, but HN does owe authors that make it to the frongpage something.<p>On the matter of clickbait, let&#x27;s agree to disagree.<p>To me it&#x27;s only &quot;bait&quot; if the result is the fish being hooked, taken out of the sea, killed and&#x2F;or eaten - or, in this case, a person served BS and ads in exchange for their link clicking attention.<p>If the fisherman just tries to grab the fishes attention to feed it instead, and the fish even likes the food, it wouldn&#x27;t be clickbait, or it wouldn&#x27;t have the negative form. And same if a post author wants to use an attractive title (it&#x27;s not as if all titles should be utilitarian description by decree).<p>Now, some decide to downvote a (IMO) good post, on the grounds they didn&#x27;t like the title. I find that shallow. And I&#x27;m with the post authors on their right to give whatever title the want (but I don&#x27;t agree with the readers right to complain about it when the content is good).')
