I think my comment was mostly driven by surprise that you&#x27;ve apparently encountered a large number of people who just throw up their hands at a slow database. I&#x27;ve worked with some people who really frustrated me (&quot;this operator isn&#x27;t doing what I expect, and I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong, must be a bug in sql server&quot;) but even they&#x27;d try to tune a slow query. But I that might be more an artifact of working in a shop where the devs owned the database bottom to top (no dba&#x27;s, and the sysadmins certainly don&#x27;t know sql). I forget that for a lot of devs writing sql might not be a daily occurrence.')
