There&#x27;s very little preventing VB for being used as a tool to run the ARM versions of Linux or your favourite flavour of BSD, but Windows probably won&#x27;t work (not until MS releases a download for Windows on ARM, at least). So, VirtualBox itself will work, but using it to run Windows applications won&#x27;t.<p>The same is true for Docker, when someone gets a Linux VM to boot, Docker becomes a possibility just like on a normal version of macOS.<p>In the end I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone manages to combine Rosetta and virtualisation instructions (even though Apple says they don&#x27;t support it) and fast-ish x64 emulation becomes a possibility. It will likely require some huge hacks that won&#x27;t be allowed into the app store, but if Apple doesn&#x27;t lock down the platform more with upcoming OS releases, developers and other technical-minded people will run that stuff just fine.')
