If you are offline, that check failed silently with no issue.  Adding the certificate server to your hosts file fixed the issue.<p>I guarantee you that code has been updated already with the recent updates and anything similar is also under review.  It&#x27;s always easy to Monday morning quarterback about edge cases after they happen :p<p>It absolutely is NOT some sort of &quot;tell&quot; for Apple locking the Mac down.  They don&#x27;t need to - if you want an appliance device they already have that with iOS.<p>There is zero upside for Apple to try to lock the Mac down; it&#x27;s all negative.  Apple can do some dumb things, but they are NOT stupid.  Used a Mac since 1986, owned one since 1987 (thanks to my crazy parents - could have had a good used car instead!) and dunno why people love to focus on the negative with Apple but unfortunately it&#x27;s nothing new.')
