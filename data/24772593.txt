So an inaccurate, but repeatable lathe, can make a more accurate screw.  I know that when you order a ball screw you will typically get a compensation curve with it, which lets you position yourself to better accuracy than the thread on the screw .. though presumably that&#x27;s not enough to machine a better screw, otherwise they&#x27;d do that ;)')
