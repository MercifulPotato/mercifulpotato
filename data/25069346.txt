Even if it was technically feasible (not sure about that), nobody is focusing on high refresh rates. Increasing refresh increases battery consumption and that means you&#x27;re taking away one of the key benefits of EPD.<p>We tested 8fps video on our devices a while back and in the end you&#x27;re getting a B&amp;W display with 8 FPS updates... Why wouldn&#x27;t you go for something like LCD or OLED instead? I don&#x27;t believe you can beat LCD at being LCD.<p>There are other technolgies that promise fast update times, that offer similar characteristics (look into ClearInk), but they are nowhere near where E Ink is in terms of maturity.')
