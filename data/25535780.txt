Not that there&#x27;s anything you can do about it, it&#x27;s the &quot;cost of doing business&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ll have to consider what&#x27;s the lifetime of this domain, should I pay now, or am I going to throw it away in a few years&#x2F;months for something else. I&#x27;ll probably keep it as it&#x27;s a good one, and I&#x27;ll put an alarm for the 4th so I have enough time to think this through.<p>The `.io` price increase looks a bit bigger relatively speaking, but nothing earth shattering... so try following the same logic as I detailed above.<p>Now the question: how often do these increase?')
