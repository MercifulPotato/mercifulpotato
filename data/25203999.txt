As with all truth, you should check with multiple sources for corroboration first. I know in Hawaii at least there was a massive DCCA (chamber of commerce) initiative started way back in 2012 to outfit all public schools with gigabit fiber and all universities with 10gigabit fiber. Hospitals also got fiber connections though I don&#x27;t know how fast, and there were a few 10gigabit undersea cables laid between the islands themselves. The state government started offering incentives and subsidies to encourage more cable landings on Oahu. This was also the same program in which they began installing the FirstNet system and the 5G infrastructure. No idea what&#x27;s going on on the mainland.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cca.hawaii.gov&#x2F;broadband&#x2F;files&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;Hawaii_Broadband_Strategic_Plan_Dec_2012.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cca.hawaii.gov&#x2F;broadband&#x2F;files&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;Hawaii_Broadb...</a>')
