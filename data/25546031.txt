As someone who likes their technology simple, I find that feature bundling like this is the norm in just about every product space nowadays.<p>My guess is that market research has found that &quot;people who both want to pay for nicer image quality and don&#x27;t want smart features&quot; is not a large enough slice of the market to be worth going after. That, or they&#x27;ve found that people who do fall into that market will generally, when forced to choose, accept the smart features (upsell! ka-ching!) rather than choose a less expensive model in order to avoid the smart features.')
