For the bedroom, which is also my WFH office, I&#x27;ve added a 100W LED that&#x27;s intended for warehouse lighting but fits nicely on top of our Ikea uplighter.  It&#x27;s controlled by a Zigbee power socket, which means I can connect it to Hue as a &quot;light&quot; or SmartThings as a &quot;switch&quot; depending on which behaviour I want.<p>It&#x27;s not quite as smooth a transition as pure Hue, but it means I can add a _lot_ of brightness when I want it.<p>The ceiling panel is really nice, and bright enough for the small area directly under it (which is my desk) but the rest of the room still seems a bit dim in comparison.<p>Unfortunately the Hue app doesn&#x27;t really know about lamp brightness -- if you ask for all lamps on really dim, and one lamp&#x27;s not dimmable, it&#x27;ll switch that one on anyway.')
