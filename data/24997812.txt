Depending on scale and focus area, they&#x27;ll include:<p>* Accounting (cost of production, allocating overhead expenses, cash flow analysis, financing terms and outcomes)<p>* Efficiency calculations and cost benefit analysis for equipment comparison<p>* Buying and selling commodities contracts<p>* Marketing your product (locking in the price optimally)<p>* Biology for dealing with animals and anything you plant<p>* Ever changing government subsidies and regulations<p>* Maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting of equipment. This helps keep you productive when the weather is good and the vendor techs are busy. Welding is really handy.<p>If you mess a couple of those up to a moderate degree, you&#x27;ll probably lose gobs of money. Do it too bad or for too long and you&#x27;ll be visiting my dad or brother for a bankruptcy.')
