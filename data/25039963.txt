Or for impromptu meetings to break out, where two people are chatting, and then another person joins, and soon there are 5-10 people in a larger discussion.<p>What it hasn&#x27;t been able to resolve (at least for me) is the awkwardness of starting conversations with strangers. This is already awkward enough in person, where you kind of have to edge your way in to an existing conversation and wait for a lull to join in. Starting a cold 1-on-1 without reading body language is just not possible for me.<p>Remotely, there&#x27;s no way to get over the step function of &quot;in the conversation&quot; where your face just pops up. For me, that lack of a gradient makes it very difficult to break the ice when meeting new people.<p>I think the physicality of Gather does help a bit, because (for example) you might sit at a &quot;let&#x27;s talk&quot; table to indicate you&#x27;re open to meeting new people, but that still basically translates to &quot;extroverts go here&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure how to solve it long term, but I think tools like there are definitely a step in the right direction.')
