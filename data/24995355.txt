I&#x27;ve had nothing but trouble from emscripten and have had to start from the beginning, just using ffplay as reference and very slowly building the application up.<p>Emsriptens proxy_to_thread option doesn&#x27;t transfer the document context correctly, so calls from SDL to change canvas size, mouse scroll events, etc, all error. I just had to comment those lines out.<p>But then the program would infinitely lock because a mutex would not return when a pthread was created. It would just spin on mutex.wait, and there were no errors in the thread creation as I tracked it line by line.<p>Then debugging randomly wouldn&#x27;t compile anymore.<p>There&#x27;s a whole blog I&#x27;ll write on it but the summary is that emscripten is cool, but the quality of it&#x27;s features isn&#x27;t ready to simply cross compile without the underlying code supporting it.')
