I don&#x27;t even pay attention to them.<p>Cooking is a nice break from screen-based activities. I put a podcast or some music on, and cook myself something nice. Since it&#x27;s a hobby, I don&#x27;t worry too much about efficiency.<p>That being said, after making a recipe once or twice, I always transcribe them, along with minor optimisations. Unlike some recipe creators, I don&#x27;t have a dish washer, so these little optimisations matter.')
