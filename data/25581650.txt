I live in Paris with 12k a year, no holidays and not comfortable but it _is_ a living wage, the minimum wage actually. I can imagine needing the triple of that if I took holidays and treated myself to nice restaurants and bought fancy clothes. But that&#x27;s still well below 70k. So if you are the kind of person that consider 70k very low, you are also the kind of person I would remorselessly take the money from.')
