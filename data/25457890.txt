Item(by='wool_gather', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608226721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429940, text='I have a trick I&#x27;ve adopted recently for nonfiction that has helped me immensely to read more and keep reading.ยน If a portion of a book is unappealing for any reason -- I feel like I already know it, it&#x27;s irrelevant, it&#x27;s impenetrable, <i>whatever</i> -- just skip ahead.<p>It&#x27;s still there if I need to come back to it. And this preserves the reading as an enjoyable and motivated experience rather than a slog that&#x27;s easy to procrastinate over. In particular, if a later section turns out to not make sense without the bit that I skipped, I&#x27;m now highly motivated to go back and understand it.<p>If you find yourself hampered by a kind of &quot;completionism&quot; like I do, you might find this very freeing and satisfying.<p>I used this tactic on a book recently that had a lot of new-to-me gems of information at the beginning and end, but fluff in the middle. Previously I would have lost out on the stuff at the end, because I would have set the book aside at some point and dreaded coming back to it.<p>---<p>ยน I absolutely didn&#x27;t invent this, but I&#x27;m also not sure where I picked it up.')
