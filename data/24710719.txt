There are a bunch of different pieces of QUIC, (not least, sorry I&#x27;m not authoritative either)<p>- SSL and &quot;TCP&quot; handshake are collapsed into a single transaction<p>- That transaction is worst case 1 network roundtrip, best case (returning user) 0 roundtrips<p>- Anti-filtering baked in.

There is not yet an accepted solution for encrypting the target server name (SSL SNI) but that&#x27;s still being worked on AFAIK<p>- &quot;Modern&quot; congestion control approach, where &quot;modern&quot; means &quot;fuck any TCP connections sharing the link&quot;')
