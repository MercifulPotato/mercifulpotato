The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends no special exclusion of pregnant women from vaccine trials or vaccine campaigns: [1] [2]<p>“<i>Despite the categorization of pregnancy as a high-risk condition for severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and mortality, pregnancy remains an exclusion for participation in vaccine trials. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and other leading organizations, including the National Academy of Medicine, have consistently advocated for the inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in vaccination trials, particularly when the following criteria are met: (1) pregnancy poses increased susceptibility to or severity of a disease; (2) the best approach to protect the infant is through passive placental antibody transfer, which provides the most efficient and direct protection to the newborn before an infant can be vaccinated, and (3) there is an active outbreak.</i>”<p>“<i>In general, SMFM strongly recommends that pregnant women have access to COVID-19 vaccines in all phases of future vaccine campaigns, and that she and her healthcare professional engage in shared decision-making regarding her receipt of the vaccine. Counseling should balance available data on vaccine safety, risks to pregnant women from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a woman’s individual risk for infection and severe disease. As data emerge, counseling will likely shift, as some vaccines may be more suitable for pregnant women. mRNA vaccines, which are likely to be the first vaccines available, do not contain a live virus but rather induce humoral and cellular immune response through the use of viral mRNA. Healthcare professionals should also counsel their patients that the theoretical risk of fetal harm from mRNA vaccines is very low.</i>”<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smfm.org&#x2F;covidclinical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smfm.org&#x2F;covidclinical</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;cdn.smfm.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;2591&#x2F;SMFM_Vaccine_Statement_12-1-20_(final).pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;cdn.smfm.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;2591&#x2F;SMFM_Vaccin...</a>')
