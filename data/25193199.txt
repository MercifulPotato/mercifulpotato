Everybody is praising Apple for their (admittedly quite excellent) M1 hardware and no one seems to take issue with that either.<p>You cannot have truly open hardware as long as (software-) patents and IP exist, simple as that. Companies need to protect their investment, since the days of comparatively simple CPUs are over and a lot of &quot;secret sauce&quot; is actually software and licensed IP blocks.<p>Since patent holders are free to select who their licensee is, they&#x27;ll always target the ones with the biggest margins (see for example [1]) so mainly consumer products and thus those won&#x27;t be free (as in speech) anytime soon.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-10-20&#x2F;nokia-seeks-to-block-lenovo-sales-in-germany-after-injunction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-10-20&#x2F;nokia-see...</a>')
