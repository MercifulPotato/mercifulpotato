If we had continued on investing and deploying as per pre-chernobyl, we might have significantly reduced emissions and been in a better place today. However, we didn&#x27;t do it, and renewables are now better and more importantly cheaper in every respect. The time window for fission to make an impact for climate has passed.<p>This is only from an environmental perspective. The technology might still be impactful and interesting where fission makes sense.')
