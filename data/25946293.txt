I&#x27;m fully remote, with the expectation of a larger in-person team sync-up every week or two (that didn&#x27;t happen yet because of COVID). My sister&#x27;s boyfriend&#x27;s team are already talking about 3&#x2F;4 days of remote work after COVID.<p>I do agree that for most companies it probably won&#x27;t be full remote, but if it just resolves in more flexibility, I&#x27;m all for it.')
