My only complaint is that I cannot seem to remember the name of the command: Is it &quot;grab&quot;, &quot;collect&quot;, &quot;pirate&quot;, &quot;organize&quot;, &quot;install&quot;, &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pull&quot;, ...?<p>So I added a note to myself into my .bashrc about this command, and patted myself on the back. The next time I reinstalled Linux, I couldn&#x27;t remember the name, but I remembered that I wrote a note to myself about it. So opened up my .bashrc, and... I didn&#x27;t feel so smart.')
