Item(by='dmytrish', descendants=None, kids=[24855060], score=None, time=1603279346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845350, text='C++ is a terrible language for small, one&#x2F;few-person projects.<p>It still sucks for bigger projects that cannot reinvent the ecosystem around them and need to rely on third-party libraries. Frameworks try to alleviate the problem and to provide a saner ecosystem sandbox, with varied success.<p>Once a project becomes large enough to define its own ecosystem (Android, Chrome, Firefox, KDE&#x2F;Qt, google3, etc), C++ becomes remotely sustainable: the language ecosystem is not a bottleneck anymore, compilers get fixed and extended when needed, libraries are heavily morphed or rewritten, build systems are usually custom anyway. It takes a gigantic snowflake to fit C++ niche, and even then it requires a lot of internal engineering and in-house experience to make developer experience bearable.<p>Rust is eating the small-scale niche like a fire, it is proving successes in the middle-scale niche. It will be interesting to see growing pains and ecosystem language&#x2F;adjustments when the new generation that started with Rust grows up and large projects start to get written and maintained in Rust.')
