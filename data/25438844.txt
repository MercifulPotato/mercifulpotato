Parallelism has to be created based on concurrency building blocks.<p>I was wondering if the two concurrency models can be compared in terms of some metrics (some measurement, quantities, ...) in aspects either mentioned above or not. (Butcher&#x27;s book doesn&#x27;t mention such metrics. I also tried  but haven&#x27;t found it in Varela&#x27;s <i>Programming Distributed Computing Systems</i>.)<p>If concurrency models can not be compared in metrics, how can they be compared?<p>I am looking for some metrics to fit into the comparison between the concurrency models. Also for books, papers and articles for comparing them.<p>Thanks.')
