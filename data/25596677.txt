When it&#x27;s my own consulting I literally add it as a line-item to the bill and let customers take it off if they want to save cost, and when it&#x27;s for professional work the only industry that has actual regulation around it is education&#x2F;government.<p>Truth is most companies are pushing the cost of development down however they can, and to cater to the accessibility market you&#x27;re sinking significant dev&#x2F;testing time into doing it right. Also, you can&#x27;t blame me in a capitalist society for dropping this on the floor when my customer&#x2F;employer wants me to... <i>in most situations</i> the hours invested into accessibility will never turn around into profit.<p>The other problem is I do accessibility right. And most devs don&#x27;t... I&#x27;ll actually go through and do UIX experiences on-screen, then replicate it &quot;blind&quot; using a screen reader. This testing&#x2F;tuning takes <i>real</i> time. Like - I can go through and do best practices with ARIA tags, well thought out HTML5, etc and still it&#x27;s a total cluster once you <i>actually</i> use the application.<p>It very much may not be &quot;ignorance&#x2F;difficult&quot; - looking at what this dev has accomplished with this editor I&#x27;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was just extra time for a <i>tiny</i> fraction of their audience that they haven&#x27;t invested yet. Harsh reality is they may not have that budget of time to go the extra steps for something as complex as this.')
