Services that use EC2 and EBS including Elastic Load Balancing, EFS, Elasticache, ECS Fargate, Sagemaker and ELB, are also impacted.&quot; It&#x27;s affecting one of our RDS databases too from 12:25pm - but not all instances. Rebooting and creating a new instance would become stuck. Sounds like a scenario of connectivity issue in one of the region&#x27;s data centers causing mass panic reboots bringing everything to a halt?')
