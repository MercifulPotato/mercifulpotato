The challenge is that you are told in advance that you&#x27;re looking for Lay&#x27;s Southern Barbecue. Remembering whether it&#x27;s there is not difficult, because it&#x27;s the only thing you want. The difficult part is <i>determining</i> whether it&#x27;s there.<p>&gt; In a physical store it&#x27;s largely possible to sequentially read the inventory even if you can&#x27;t quickly search for individual items randomly quickly.<p>Again, this badly misunderstands what I was saying. It is <i>not</i> possible to sequentially read the inventory in a physical store; if this were possible, determining whether or not a particular product existed in the store would be trivial. Instead, this task is one that people routinely fail at.')
