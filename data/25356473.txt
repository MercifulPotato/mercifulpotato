No special APIs for vendor only, and no ToC clauses prohibiting third-party clients&#x2F;integrations.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to work around the &quot;COM problem&quot;, though - IIRC, your product can have just as deep integrations with Outlook &amp; Office as Teams has, if you&#x27;re willing to throw man-hours at dealing with the clumsiness of COM. This understandably advantages a company with lots of money to spend and direct access to people who develop the platform. Some non-MS products still manage to ship with deep integrations, but in my experience, they tend to be fragile.<p>That said, I feel it would be a tremendous help for both competition and integration, if some form of &quot;can&#x27;t restrict access to a service to vendor-owned clients&quot; clause entered the law.<p>It&#x27;s kind of my problem with products being turned into services - service providers currently have way too much power over their customers&#x2F;users.')
