You could have, for example, a working &#x2F;boot, but a dead &#x2F;. In that case, the kernel will boot up and then panic when it can&#x27;t mount root.<p>A bad mbr is also possible, for reasons unrelated to any filesystem. And a journaling filesystem doesn&#x27;t always help with drive errors, etc.  I was trying to scope down to filesystem issues due to an unorderly shutdown, where the disk drive itself is fine.')
