Item(by='grog454', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610835904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806089, text='Fleet is an io type game set in an infinitely large, procedurally generated universe with stars, planets, and the like.<p>As the title says the game is built using pure dart for the servers and dart+flutter for the cross platform client on Android, iOS, and web. The repository is currently 98.7% dart code. After dealing with rewriting a complete code base for Nebulous (native Android &#x2F;w Java and native iOS &#x2F;w swift) I decided I would never do that again. Flutter won out over other cross platform tools for 2 reasons: (1) I find Dart more enjoyable to write than any other language I&#x27;ve used and (2) Flutter was quicker for me to deploy 3x starting from 0 knowledge than anything else I tried. I miss the flexibility writing direct openGL code provides but was pleasently surprised by the performance of Skia so far.<p>The game is inspired by numerous games that I&#x27;ve enjoyed in the past: Privateer 2 &#x2F; Wing Commander, WoW, Starcraft 2, and most obviously Nebulous which was in turn inspired by Agar.io.<p>Fleet is a little more PVE focused than Nebulous and encourages grouping up. The core gameplay mechanics are mostly balanced now but anything is subject to change.')
