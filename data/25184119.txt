Or, you voted for Prop 123XYZ? I don&#x27;t feel safe working here anymore. You&#x27;re putting at risk my existence and my validity as a human being.&quot;<p>How do we move past &quot;I&#x27;m in real physical danger because you disagree on my party choice&quot;? Are HR departments currently equipped to tell their employees that perhaps they&#x27;re being hyperbolic and political disagreements aren&#x27;t equal to threats of physical violence?<p>Like many others said here, we&#x27;re making it more and more unacceptable for people who vote differently in private to work together, which of course leads to more polarization, tribalism, and the formation of echo chambers that self-radicalize.')
