Decentralised systems are resilient. But their decentralisation has a co√∂rdination cost. The lack of this cost makes centralised systems more agile. They can also, on account of reduced redundancy, be more efficient.<p>In a stable environment agility is irrelevant. The efficiency of centralisation pits evenly against the robustness of decentralisation. In reality, we get a mix, <i>e.g.</i> our financial system.<p>In an unstable environment, however, the agility advantage tips scales in favour of centralisation. The past decades have seen radical computing advances in mobility, prevalence and capability. That gives a natural advantage to centralised players like Apple and Google and Alibaba.<p>Decentralisation becomes competitive once a landscape stabilises. I thought this occurred with laptops. But Apple Silicon shuffles the deck. (It <i>does</i> appear true for social media.)')
