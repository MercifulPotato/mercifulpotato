My Nvidia card was installed in 2012.  It&#x27;s always worked fine with the proprietary Nvidia driver up until I got kernel 5.9.  My system has been hell since then.  I had to switch back to Nouveau, and now I get crashes in Xwayland and Nouveau several times <i>a day</i>.  This is bad enough I&#x27;m about to order an AMD card on Amazon and ban Nvidia from my life.')
