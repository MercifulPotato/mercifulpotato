Looking at your second link, I like Joe Fitz as a person, and I know he means well. He is a bit of a &quot;progressive&quot; partisan in SF politics.<p>The &quot;Progressive&quot; camp (I use quotes because their policies are often about stopping progress, especially in growing business and housing) would often bring out Ron Conways name whenever they needed a boogyman for rich tech who is somehow pulling strings behind the scenes.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of behind the scenes where Ron would donate some money to a cause and then just be supportive. But I didn&#x27;t get the sense that he was some political mastermind behind the scenes like the progressives often paint him as.<p>Another anecdote. I was at Square when Jack Dorsey announced that Square would no longer be allowed at gun shows or for any other kinds of gun sales. This was around the time of a mass shooting, I forget which one, there have sadly been so many.<p>Several years later, I was at an small event and panel about gun violence and what would be done about it. Ron Conway was there to introduce the panel and he talked about how, a few years prior, he had gotten very passionate about the issue after some mass shootings. He got a lot of Silicon Valley CEOs and leaders together to both raise money but also see how they could work to reduce gun violence.<p>At that moment I put it all together. Jack Dorsey had been at that Ron Conway event and that convinced him to shut down gun sales with Square.')
