People will pay for the validation.<p>Non-selective schools (like Leicester, which admits 80%!of applicants, of which only 20% choose to attend) won’t be able to pull this off.  The signaling value is too weak.  They can’t get you an interview at a top company. If they can’t prepare you for it, how many parents will pay for a 4 year vacation?')
