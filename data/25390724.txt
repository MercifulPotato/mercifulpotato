I have long rallied against population explosion but I seldom come face to face(online here, as it were) with someone with an actual large family with the same set of parents.<p>For context: my father was my grandmother’s 14th child at the age of 48. She died at the ripe old age of 93 or 95. I am aware of both the joys a large family can bring as well as the toll it takes on not just the family but also the lion’s share of community resources..that are really meant to be the commons ..that it consumes.<p>Our family is now spread all over the world. Because most families were similar to mine, it got too too crowded in India. You have to understand that this story began 60-100 years before you started having kids. And India is a lot older than America. So I have the advantage of being IN your preview. A resource crunch can only be resolved by a search for more resources. If the large family was a blessing, it also became the seed of its own destruction.<p>If you notice..in the USA and on other affluent nations that attract a lot of immigrants, the majority are from countries with a large expanding population. Large families that become more and more unsustainable with each generation. The outflow is due to resources being stretched thinner and thinner.<p>If in Florida, you are an anomaly, you have hacked the system by capturing more from the commons where others maintain smaller families. But if everyone followed your example, then it would be detrimental.<p>If you live in a sparsely populated location with sufficient resources and live responsibly to renew most of what can be renewed, then there is a plan. But the country and govt doesn’t have any such plan and if secluded pockets with higher birth rates start running out of resources, they will have to spread out. And the rate of consumption will increase exponentially if their ground resources are already thin(which it’s likely to be)<p>Because we can’t turn back time, I guess my question to you is if you encourage others to be like you or dissuade them? Alternatively, how do you envision the world if everyone emulated you because it sounds appealing?')
