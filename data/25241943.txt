We bought two adult seats and a child seat. The bet was that no one would want to be close to a wailing baby and we’d get the 4th seat. The bet panned out and we got all 4 seats.<p>Baby had fun being comfy and being able to sleep flat.<p>Business is way too expensive. Regular seat is $1.5k from Seattle to Dubai, Business&#x2F;First is like $10k. Insane. I’d happily pay $3k for comfort of two seats and be able to sleep.<p>Our journey from SEA -&gt; NBO is 30hrs minimium with at-least one leg.')
