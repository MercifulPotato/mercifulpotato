The new stuff cannot be upgrade, so when amount of RAM stops to be sufficient, old computer needs to be recycled (a modern word for throwing something into waste bin together with all CO2 that was emitted when computer was produced, not to mention environmental costs of digging rare earths, etc.).<p>I am still able to use my Lenovo Thinkpad 510T only because I could easily replace HDD with cheap, stock Samsung EVO SSD and throw more RAM.<p>The absurdity of Apple approach is that Mac Mini with 512 GB SSD is $200 more expensive than the one with 256 GB. 256 GB for $200 is a crazy price, so Apple basically says: hey, pay us a lot, lot more, so maybe you can use our stuff a bit longer, but, in fact, we try to actively discourage you from doing this, since we want you to buy cheaper model and in two-three years you will need to buy a new fancier model.<p>But Tim Cook will tell you a lot how much he cares about humanity, environment and CO2 emission. Maybe he will even fly his private jet to some conference to tell people how awful is all that oil &amp; gas &amp; coal industry.')
