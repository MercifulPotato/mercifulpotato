Of course I am free to choose gold on a personal level, but shouldn&#x27;t it be the default strategy of every investor to not store value in energy?<p>Going back to your first comment:<p>&gt;Everything we produce can be measured in &#x2F; has energy cost. So maybe some kind of energy units should be the universal currency.<p>I can imagine that energy can be used as the unit for value transactions. For value storage however, it&#x27;s the other way round: I think value has to be stored in assets that don&#x27;t depend on energy.')
