A mayor of an American city would have no incentive to hide an emerging disease because they know that report would have no impact on its own. In both cases, nothing is done until shit hits the fan. The difference is that China actually managed to control the pandemic, as evident in how you&#x27;re allowed to be mask-free in many cities.<p>As far as sanctions go, they only make sense if you&#x27;re goals are strictly economically related. Punishing China with sanctions for the pandemic largely ineffective strategy because you&#x27;re hurting your own side just as much.')
