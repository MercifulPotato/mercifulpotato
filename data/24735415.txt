The idea that working a cash register now takes more skill than before is false. The idea that you have to now have more knowledge is false. People were not stupid back then and supermarkets still existed, and neither then nor now does a minimum wage employee need vast amounts of knowledge. The best retail employee has a positive attitude, not knowledge of how to get to the bread aisle. It is outrageous to make such a comparison and assume current jobs are more difficult or harder when advances in nearly all technology has only improved. Remember when cashiers had to do math?')
