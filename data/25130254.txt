In general the principle of “if you don’t want people to see something don’t post it publicly” is a good principle that predates computers.<p>As for robots.txt: don’t forget that it predated Google, even  when g was just a grad school project.  Nothing weird about it: we also specify how the http protocol works.  Humans use “AI-hard” adaptive protocols and there’s no reason computers won’t in future, but they can’t yet and it’s not unreasonable to have to adapt to that.<p>There are many many reasons to criticize Google but I think your argument is not one of them.')
