Humans are frequently treated as commodities, as any team over the size of 1 needs to delegate responsibilities to people. Hence, &quot;doctor, lawyer, police officer, teacher, pilot&quot; are all words that describe a delegated responsibility of a human, and therefore the commodity that they represent. &quot;We need more firefighters!&quot; is a phrase that literally treats humans as commodities - showing how replaceable they are. How about whenever you ask a friend, or a family member to pick something up for you from the grocery store? Are they not being treated as a commodity to suit a need in that moment?<p>However idealistic the notion, being a &quot;sentient being&quot; isn&#x27;t mutually exclusive from being treated as a commodity.<p>I understand the empathic argument in support of veganism full well (and I empathize with it), but there is such a thing as runaway-empathy, to the point that it becomes unproductive conversation.<p>This is a win in an aim to reduce unnecessary suffering and pain. I&#x27;ll take it as such.<p>Seeking some sort of absolutism though, I can&#x27;t wrap my mind around that. It gives me some serious Sith vibes...')
