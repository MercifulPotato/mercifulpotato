Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605028818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048264, text='The paper compares to a group of people diagnosed with influenza (and a number of other things), as a control. For the flu, they find that 13.3% of these people had the same symptoms (vs. 18.8% in the covid cohort; ratio = 1.41). This is in Table 3.<p>Table 2 shows you the similar analysis, but just for <i>first-time diagnoses</i>, and these are 5.8% (covid) vs. 2.8% (influenza) for a ratio of 2.07. So while there do appear to be differences in the groups, focusing on the absolute percentage in the covid cohort alone is a misleading and fear-mongering way to interpret the results.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanpsy&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2215-0366(20)30462-4&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanpsy&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2215-0...</a>')
