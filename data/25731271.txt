No set of agreed-upon facts?<p>I think that&#x27;s the important thing right there. Echo chambers and identity politics have divided the USA greatly.<p>The way forward is not to divide more. For example Biden inferring that Trump is hitler and calling Senator Cruz Goebbels the nazi propaganda minister is not going to heal the divide.<p>&gt;Now I of course have my own very strong opinions and I&#x27;m sure I have a good comprehension of the truth. But that isn&#x27;t going to convince anyone on the other side anymore. To people on one side, the other side&#x27;s minds appear to be just poisoned.<p>Imagine this for a second. Say you are going to spend all your waking hours reading the news. You could read every major source. You could review videos, pictures, you could have a good knowledge of what&#x27;s going on in a small part of the world. You wont know what&#x27;s going in 90%+ of the world.<p>The problem is that you cant do that. You dont have the time to do that and so you only look at a few sources. We then have the problem that the news cant be trusted. It&#x27;s beyond clear that they publish outright lies.<p>That&#x27;s why we have these delusion vs reality issues. To fix this problem isn&#x27;t to give people more time. It certainly isn&#x27;t to remove opposing viewpoints.<p>When you tear out a man&#x27;s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you&#x27;re only telling the world that you fear what he might say. -George RR Martin')
