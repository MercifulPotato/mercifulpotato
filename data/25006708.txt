Item(by='akalsz', descendants=None, kids=[25007003, 25006878], score=None, time=1604660413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006462, text='Yes, and it&#x27;s absolutely solvable by bots (there&#x27;s even a browser plugin for it[1]) so it isn&#x27;t available if Google decides you are one. But it does work if you aren&#x27;t that suspicious, so most of the time it should let blind users through. Well it&#x27;s a bit more complicated because there are scores and such, but from an end-user perspective that&#x27;s how it usually works.<p>Though if you aren&#x27;t considered suspicious, image captchas are way less ridiculous, too. The scoring system goes all the way from .1 to .9, but usually you&#x27;re either in one or the other category based on who knows what (probably mostly ip addresses, but Google doesn&#x27;t tell us so who knows?).<p>So in the end the service is mostly just something that arbitrarily classifies users as one or the other, bots can absolutely solve them when classified as &quot;probably human&quot; and they&#x27;re impossible for humans when classified as &quot;probably bot&quot;.<p>If you want to actually present users a challenge to verify they&#x27;re human, you&#x27;re even better off giving them something like captchouli[2], or just a good old scrambled letters on a picture thing (which is what Google uses for their login as well, BTW). hCaptcha is also a great alternative (anything is, really) since it&#x27;s still mostly about classifying users by making suspicious ones solve challenges. reCAPTCHA is absolutely not, it judges you before the challenge.<p>And that&#x27;s fine, some websites want that. It&#x27;s their choice, I&#x27;m not mad if they ban me for not wanting to be tracked, it&#x27;s probably for the better. What does make me angry is that reCAPTCHA is advertised falsely, that the challenge is a joke and a crime against humanity at once, and that despite that, people seem to believe that it&#x27;s the challenge that is magically blocking the bots without realizing they&#x27;re also blocking legitimate users.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dessant&#x2F;buster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dessant&#x2F;buster</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bakape&#x2F;captchouli" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bakape&#x2F;captchouli</a>')
