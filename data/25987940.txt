Europeans are fighting for similar reasons which is loss of control of their own media and a takeover by US propaganda and norms by companies who have failed to pay their taxes again and again.<p>imo it doesn&#x27;t matter that many of these local outlets are backward, racist and populist rags (never criticizing the Australian concentration camps, or failure of capturing the idiocy of the AAbill, or whatever justifies being outraged about etc), the big guys (FB&#x2F;Google) are expert in doing the same thing but at scale and with better PR (+ they can do so without paying their taxes).<p>As long as it hurts BigTech it&#x27;s the right move no matter what &quot;appears&quot; right or wrong. These firms and their management are parasites and they need to be treated as such until they a) pay their taxes and b) respect local laws.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Australian_immigration_detention_facilities" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Australian_immigration_detenti...</a>')
