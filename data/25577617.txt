I do believe a display could be interesting for some use cases, but one of the strengths of VR is handtracking and tracked controllers. VR wasn&#x27;t particularly interesting without an input system and that&#x27;s regularly disconnected by both VR skeptics and VR lovers. A volumetric display you could reach into (think Black Panther &quot;black sand&quot;) would be amazing.')
