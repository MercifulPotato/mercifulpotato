I have worked with some brilliant people, some incredibly efficient people, as well as both medicore and poor coders.<p>There are things brilliant programmer can do and concepts they can realise or creativity they can apply that a poor programmer couldn&#x27;t dream of.<p>But it&#x27;s never quite so simple as 10x, never so easy to quantify as their being able to complete a given task faster or produce more work.<p>What I have seen far more often however are programmers finding sneaky ways to appear more productive. Cutting corners, hacking things in and - an often overlooked technique - happening to have a such a good knowledge of their own pile of crud messy code that they can in fact produce solutions _considerably_ more quickly (because you know your own mess better than other people&#x27;s).<p>None of these types of programmer are good for an organisation, some in fact are positively toxic and very destructive. In many cases a better programmer would take longer, sometimes considerably more so. But by perpetuating this 10x idea things get topsy-turvy and it&#x27;s the poorer coder who gets categorised as brilliant and the brilliant coder who gets categorised as poor.<p>Another aspect of the &#x27;rock star programmer&#x27; meme (which this is a variant of) is somebody who&#x27;s genuinely very sharp can often be good at coming up with ideas but lousy at implementing them and worse at taking criticism. I&#x27;ve seen an extreme example of this in my career.<p>Often the best solution requires careful thought, consideration and design. The best programmers are the ones who weigh up the RoI and, while remaining practical, think things through carefully.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve worked at a startup (from employee #1 to multiple VC rounds) where the CEO believed in this meme and seen the damage it does first hand.')
