Making another TODO app with email remainders, quantified self, CRM&#x27;s to manage connections with friends and family.<p>Those kind of apps that are created by &quot;self improvement nerds&quot; for people like them. Problem is those apps never solve any real world issues. Because people who are self improvement nerds would rather build their own system and people who don&#x27;t care about it won&#x27;t use it.<p>For me those apps are in category of self improvement books. Where for most of the people investment in self improvement system quickly goes above return on that investment. Just when you start tweaking your .vimrc and at the end of the day instead of doing work you just played with your settings.<p>Using such tools and tweaking those will quickly end up in using tool instead of actually living ones life. When you know your uncle Ted does not like you, using system that reminds you about his birthday is not going to change that. You are not going to become millionaire by using some system that &quot;millionaires use&quot;. Using Elon Musk time management is not going to make you successful owner of multiple companies if you are working 9-5 drone job.')
