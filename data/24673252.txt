Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601744363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671880, text='I think implementing a general-purpose TCP&#x2F;IP stack entirely in an FPGA is not likely to be very good return on investment, especially if you&#x27;ll want stuff like filtering, (selective) packet capture etc.<p>However, specialized stacks for certain purposes are a relatively common thing. For example, most L23 network testing solutions use FPGAs to generate and receive massive amounts of (almost) stateless traffic (think line rate for 400GE using just 2 machines), while performing certain kinds of analysis on it (latency, loss). But these are usually just Ethernet frames or maybe IP datagrams with random payloads.')
