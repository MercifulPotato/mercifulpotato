A lot has been said about people not being able to handle criticism, about being &quot;weak&quot;, or snowflakes, etc. I believe that is a misdiagnosis. Because when many people shriek the loudest about wanting to &quot;cancel&quot; others, or taking an unintended slight as a symbol of &quot;vicious oppression&quot;, these people are usually speaking from a position of <i>power</i>, not a position of weakness.<p>Being able to whip a Twitter frenzy of many thousands of people into a scarlet-letter stamping mob doesn&#x27;t sound very &quot;weak&quot; to me. At the end of the day, what this really is is a <i>power struggle</i>, and understanding why many feel the need to engage so passionately in this power struggle will get you closer to the heart of the issue IMO.')
