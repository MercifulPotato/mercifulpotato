The core fund trades commodities and stocks&#x2F;options in a pair format with short holding times. To make their public fund, they needed to adopt more scalable strategies which meant longer holding periods.<p>So it&#x27;s not a matter of choosing&#x2F;assigning ex post - they are fundamentally different approaches. They said up front that the public fund wouldn&#x27;t replicate the internal fund. Whether people listened to them or not is another question.<p>I get that we should be skeptical, but by the same token I don&#x27;t think you can says fraud is happening without any evidence. Yes, they had a tax case - but that was related to their derivatives contracts and the tax handling of them. Clearly they were wrong on that - and they&#x27;ve stopped using them - and still been up huge after that.<p>I&#x27;m just not clear why we should assume fraud just because they are successful. To me, it looks like tiny profits magnified by enormous leverage - but with holding periods and market neutral positioning to reduce risk.')
