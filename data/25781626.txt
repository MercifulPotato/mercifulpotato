Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25781877, 25784330], score=None, time=1610654301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25780359, text='&gt; My group gave up on 5e because it (subjective) felt like the PCs were overpowered early on (especially the healing rules).<p>Well, compared to the “classic” versions (through, oh, AD&amp;D&#x2F;2e), 5e’s handling of cantrips and assignment of hit dice to classes make the primary casters more active and less like eggshells at low levels, and healing outside of “healer” character abilities is much more generous by default (but there is also, in the books, a simple option that makes it grittier reverses all of that except the not-eggshells parts, by increasing the time for “short rests” and “long rests” which are key for both healing and spell recovery.) Also, I feel like lots of tables by people who come from older versions underuse exhaustion.')
