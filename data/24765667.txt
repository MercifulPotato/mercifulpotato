Item(by='DetroitThrow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602598127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765532, text='Downtown rents in Detroit were very, very high compared to the surrounding area because of workers desiring to live in a very small radius of the immediate downtown area <i></i>primarily<i></i> to be close to work and downtown amenities&#x2F;restaurants.<p>QuickenLoans would be the biggest employer downtown right now, not the car companies, and other tech companies have been moving in as well. Rents were exacerbated by a shortage of apartment stock, homogeneous ownership of apartments (i.e. by Dan Gilbert), and lack of affordable parking in a city where cars are still required. Rents outside the downtown area can be almost half as much because of this, despite all still within a 10-20 minute drive.<p>Overall, I&#x27;ve seen most downtown rents drop by several hundred dollars, usually by maybe a fifth of the previous amount (which seems very close to the percentage mentioned). Outside of downtown, the drops have been MUCH less steep, if at all.')
