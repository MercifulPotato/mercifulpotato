At risk of over-simplifying:\n- Sia is the blockchain project that lets renters and hosts create a market for storage space. (using SiaCoin as the cryptocurrency)\n- Skynet uses this market to provide a data backend for a web ecosystem for developers and users. They access the ecosystem through &quot;portals,&quot; which are actually just specialized hosts on the sia network.<p>Data on the Sia network is encrypted at a storage layer (as part of splitting it up to send it to hosts), but Skynet files are accessible to anyone who has its hash (portals, ISP, etc could see this info when you access the URL).
