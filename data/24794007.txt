Accepting that you were wrong is generally a hard thing. Admitting to someone else that you were wrong is similarly hard.<p>If you get totally and irrefutably proven wrong by someone you are having a heated argument with, that is doubly hard. In order to respond correctly you need to, within a very short time-span:\n- Realize the argument makes sense\n- Accept your entire world-view, with a great many other related things, is wrong\n- Admit that you were wrong to someone who just a minute ago you were angry at, who you thought was making bad arguments, and someone you felt was attacking you.<p>Doing that in the span of 10 seconds is really hard. I could easily understand how someone would fail, and instead get even angrier at the person making the argument. This certainly is irrational, but it is not a sign of mental illness. It is a form of irrationality that I am ashamed to admit I also have sometimes.<p>I think a big deal in the on-line space. Is that there is barely a way to re-engage after a cool-down period. You can&#x27;t come back to a discussion a few days later, having had more time to process.<p>Especially with conspiracy theories, the shift in worldview that is required to accept that it is wrong is massive, that isn&#x27;t going to happen over the span of a minute. Heck, it seems unlikely to happen over the span of a day.')
