That is just <i>staggeringly</i> high. What I&#x27;m paying $6&#x2F;month for with Arq would be over $160&#x2F;month if I were using Tarsnap, and I&#x27;m getting end-to-end encryption, deduplication, and versioned file backups. What advantages does Tarsnap bring to the table that justify such a tremendous cost?')
