It seems to solve pretty much every concern I had, with not much downside. The biggest pain point was not being able to easily put the massive build files on an external hard drive, but you can do it with —disk_cache and —output_base. Unfortunately lots of scripts don’t expose a direct interface to the bazel command, making it necessary to modify those.<p>Still, nice build system.')
