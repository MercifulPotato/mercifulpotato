Scaling manual labor can&#x27;t work indefinitely due to the scarcity of talent.<p>Keep in mind that while a human being is very good at categorizing things, they&#x27;re terrible at doing it over and over again, so the scarce talents are likely consistency and conscientiousness.<p>You should expect that, overall, the (n+1)th person you hire is marginally less talented than the nth. And while people are constantly entering and exiting the labor pool, this is negated by the fact that you&#x27;re trying to expand your share of it.<p>So while there&#x27;s a lot of randomness in recruiting, if you enforce any kind of standard, you&#x27;ll hit a point where not enough candidates meet that standard, so you have to drop it. Once it is below the threshold of &quot;better than AI&quot; you have no reason to hire more people.<p>And you&#x27;ll try to expand your eligible pool by raising wages, but everyone else wants consistent, conscientious people, too, so you&#x27;re liable to run into the economic constraint: the amount you have to pay someone will exceed the value they&#x27;re adding as a moderator.')
