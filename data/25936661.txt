It&#x27;s a fund to give you income in retirement. That&#x27;s a pension! You can have both defined-benefit and defined-contribution pensions. Not all pensions are defined-benefit: 401(k) is a defined-contribution pension.<p>Wikipedia say it&#x27;s a pension:<p>&gt; a 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored defined-contribution pension<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;401(k)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;401(k)</a><p>The US Code also says it&#x27;s a pension - 401 is &#x27;Qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans&#x27; and 401(k) is covered under the &#x27;qualified pension&#x27; clause (&#x27;qualified&#x27; meaning the same as &#x27;defined contribution&#x27; in this case.)<p>If it looks like a pension and quacks like a pension and is called a pension in law and is called a pension in non-technical resources like Wikipedia then... it&#x27;s a pension!')
