They&#x27;re probably right. But it&#x27;s an elegant and well-designed language that has a lot of the same features and feeling of a LISP&#x2F;Scheme.<p>I know I could be burned alive for saying it, but Common Lisp is pretty ugly, IMO. It&#x27;s &quot;pragmatic&quot; and has a bunch of libraries and functionality and whatnot, but it&#x27;s not as fun or elegant as a minimal, pure, Scheme.')
