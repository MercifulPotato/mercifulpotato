The upsides and downsides here come in different units so it&#x27;s still tricky.<p>Lots of instructions can be proposed with impressive qualitative speeches convincing you how dandy they are, but in the end it&#x27;s down to the real world speedup yield vs the price you pay in complexity and resulting second order effects.<p>(In rarer cases the instructions might be added not for performance reasons but to ease complexity and cost, that&#x27;s where qualitative arguments still have a place when arguing for adding instructions).<p>It&#x27;s fine if we don&#x27;t have the evidence in this thread - I was just asking on the off chance that someone can point to a reference.')
