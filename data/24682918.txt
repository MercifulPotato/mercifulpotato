The idea of two RNA-copying molecules encountering each other feels eye-opening to me. Thank you!<p>One thing I&#x27;m still unclear about though: Isn&#x27;t it the case that these RNA-copying molecules are made of proteins? If so, I assume that another necessary ingredient would be the existence of proteins that synthesize new proteins according to what is written in RNA molecules (and also: RNA molecules that describe such synthesizing proteins).')
