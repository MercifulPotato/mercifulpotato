Nowhere in the charter of Conservapedia is any admonition to be unbiased! &quot;Be conservative&quot; is in their <i>name</i>! (And their slogan, and their site rules...)<p>The same is true of Rationalwiki, but less directly. It was created by the promoters of a specific ideology, and as the chessboard of subculture politics evolved, the fact that the people who posted there were generally inclined toward promoting ideologies proved to be a more stable trend than any particular ideology. Right now it&#x27;s one kind of leftist, but in the future it could evolve into a breed of leftism, or something else entirely. In any case, it will probably go on being ideological in nature, as it always has been, right from conception.<p>Wikipedia has done relatively well as far as political bias goes. Emphasis on the word &quot;relatively,&quot; but it&#x27;s not the worst thing ever. Jimmy Wales is the best person to lead an attempt to repeat that state of not-abject-failure, because we already know that he is a reliable supporter of democratic principles and sticking to the facts. (Democratic principles including the democratic principle of averaging the opinion of everyone who shows up.)')
