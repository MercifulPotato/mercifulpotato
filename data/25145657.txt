I hope it improves but I wonder if this is the sort of thing that goes to the core of what sort of product it is. OSM is fantastic at maps, if I want to navigate around my immediate area that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll use. Google maps is a fantastic location database, if I&#x27;m trying to find something I&#x27;ll use it but the maps suck.')
