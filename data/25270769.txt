While pundits on American TV News decried the sex and violence that was prevalent on the entertainment-only channels, they were slowly training us over decades to accept only two points of view that were always at war with each other (Orwell says hi). The Tale of Two Realities that we&#x27;ve been living in for the past 5 years is a testament to their success. The sex and the violence didn&#x27;t harm us as much as they said because they were just easy punching bags the whole time. This is exactly what Postman and others were warning us about.')
