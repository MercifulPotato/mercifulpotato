The only thing I can estimate now are how long shoes last (almost every day for three years), but when I was growing up (several decades ago) I would only have one school uniform which would be worn every school day for a few years. It would have been my older brother&#x27;s before me and my younger brother&#x27;s after me. The number of times shorts would be worn would be in the high hundreds. I kinda have similar expectations now - for example, I have a t-shirt that I have been wearing about 20 or 30 times a year for the last twenty years. I&#x27;m hoping for another 20 years wear!')
