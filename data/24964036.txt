We as humans are being outclassed in a digital fight with tech companies.  We need to have software on our side individually.   But we also need the political environment for that.<p>A generation or two ago most of the western world fought wars over the spoils of the industrial revolution - and built a political-economic environment that benefitted individuals and shared the wealth more so than in hundreds of years.<p>The countries that do this again for the digital revolution are going to benefit as much as the west did last time.<p>It might not be us.<p>Writing the software to guide our lives is the easy part.  It&#x27;s not about social media - that&#x27;s just the obvious part.  This is going to be about all parts of our lives - banking software that considers your long term budget and stops you buying the crap item on amazon.<p>Software that sits down each evening and reviews how you spoke with your wife &#x2F; child &#x2F; co worker<p>I am going to have to put this into a book form to gain any traction - plus it&#x27;s 1 am so I am likely not making best sense, but this is so inherent in the technology it just seems obvious as a next step.
