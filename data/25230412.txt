At least these bulk targets are more likely to be people with the means to defend themselves from thin-skinned or overreaching govs. However, I admit that doesn&#x27;t change the overall ethics much.<p>A larger issue is that after decades of US being a leader of bad international behavior, many worse Govs are emulating and building on our invasive strategies.<p>Predictably, the US ceaselessly whines &amp; lashes out at nations who follow our blueprint.
