It&#x27;s about moral growth. As a child you do things you later regret doing (e.g. hurting people). As a society we look back, and while we realize the circumstances were very different before (and we don&#x27;t have to make a judgment about moral problems), we can still recognize that some things were problematic (enslaving other human beings, not letting women vote, not letting people of color vote, etc) and that we do not want to do that now.<p>This is best understood (not as &quot;popularity&quot; or &quot;fad&quot;, but) as moral growth. And it&#x27;s good.<p>You are fighting over semantics &quot;able&quot; vs &quot;should&quot;. I am trying to use language that is not confrontational. I am not calling you a bad person, I do not think you are. I am asking you politely, in the privacy of your own mind, to reflect on some practices we take for granted. And to realize that the parallel is that in the past we&#x27;ve made moral mistakes, and that we are likely making a moral mistake now.<p>I proclaim that it&#x27;s good to mature and grow up. I hope we as a civilization grow out of this phase where we abuse the shit out of billions of sentient creatures for a the unimportant goal of having food taste slightly different.')
