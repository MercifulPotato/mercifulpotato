People really do not like being told what to do. This is a reality anywhere in life, and requires a deft hand. Knowing when to push, what to push for, which hills to die on, etc.<p>Code style and linting should be an easy win. I think locating a few examples of a bad pattern in the codebase that multiple people repeated is a good way to make certain quality improvements sustainable. But you can’t do that every time otherwise people will think that’s all you do. You also can’t keep hounding one person in code reviews, you’ll lose their morale as well. It’s a balance, and almost more of a social issue.<p>Sometimes it great to point out stuff being done right too. It’d be great if it was a team effort so it there isn’t one word of god out there.')
