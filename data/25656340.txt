Much like it has a &quot;c++ app&quot;, &quot;terminal app&quot; and &quot;compile this&quot; app, it also ships with a &quot;calc app&quot; (literally called &quot;calc&quot;). Since it was being used by lot of mathy people for lot of mathy stuff, it ended up being a proper scientific calculator application.<p>(Also, Lisps are inherently friendly for doing any kind of symbolic calculations. A Lisp system is one of the least surprising places to find a symbolic integrator in.)')
