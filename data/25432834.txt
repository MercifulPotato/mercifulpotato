First, that sounds like a pretty clear signal that the business is pointedly <i>not</i> targeting EU citizens. Such a business would not be envisaging &quot;offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union&quot;.<p>Second, that business probably does not operate in any meaningful way in the EU, making any obligations under GDPR a matter of legal fiction. With no kind of enforceability, any GDPR rights or obligations are meaningless.')
