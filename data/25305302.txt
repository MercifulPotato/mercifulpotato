The tests are still flaky but it doesn&#x27;t matter if we can reproduce the results.<p>You don&#x27;t even have to record all inputs. You could just use a random seed, and record the seed at each run. Test become deterministic again simply by fixing the seed (typically to a value that caused the previous run to fail).')
