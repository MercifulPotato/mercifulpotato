If there&#x27;s anything we would expect to reset the cost of equipment, it&#x27;s a new and incompatible mount which saps the used market of its entire supply and lets manufacturers to charge higher rates for new and shiny gear. Also, inflation adjusted a lot of those are still cheaper than the original 1971 lens, despite having more features.<p>By the by, I really don&#x27;t get the rush to mirrorless. I hate electronic viewfinders, the really small bodies are hard to handle with bigger lenses, and the prices are outrageous. I&#x27;ll probably keep using  SLRs for the next 20-30 years.')
