Literally everyone that’s worked in any service or retail industry can tell you horror stories. Supervisors routinely break labor laws and abuse their position in the name of “getting shit done”. Most of it is so minor it’s not worth risking your job to complain. And when something big happens and you say something to higher ups you get brushed off. If you’re lucky your boss might pay attention and then eventually the jerk breaking the laws gets fired.')
