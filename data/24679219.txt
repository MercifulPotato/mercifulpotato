The ethical decisions that happen in the industry aren&#x27;t made by the software engineers.<p>2. The boundaries around those decision are very grey. Can I create a feature that breaches user&#x27;s privacy? What if I don&#x27;t build the feature but just write documentation for it? What if I do pure research but then my research is used for a morally questionable purpose by the company? What if my company does a bunch of shady things but not my department? What if my company respects its users but mistreats its employees? What if my company treats employess and users fairly but it&#x27;s in a questionable industry like gambling for example? Or what if I make a game that&#x27;s perfectly fine for most players but a small number of them get addicted to the point that it ruins their lives? And so on, these questions go on forever and it&#x27;s not as straightforward as &quot;do no harm&quot;.')
