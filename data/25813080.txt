That&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s professional, but rather because I&#x27;m jewish and what happened to this employee feels like a very present threat.<p>It is a well-documented fact that neo-nazi hate groups were a significant presence in the riot and preceding &quot;protest&quot; at the capital. Stating that fact ultimately lead to a nazi-apologist coworker denying it, and then the jewish employee being fired.')
