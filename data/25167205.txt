An online furniture selling shop asked me a NP complete problem in the interview. No problem with that but their compensation wasn&#x27;t even half of what FAANGs would offer. And I bet most of the engineers over there wouldn&#x27;t be able to solve it without preparing for it first. When you&#x27;re interviewing someone, you <i>feel</i> smart because you already know the questions but these shops make it incredibly hard for the average joe to get in. Questions like design a logging library or a rate limiter in a 45 minute interview cannot possibly be solved. Most interviewers <i>think</i> they&#x27;re evaluating the candidate on merit but in my experience it&#x27;s just to check if the candidate says what they want to hear.')
