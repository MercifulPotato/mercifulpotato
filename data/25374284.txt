I suspect that&#x27;s true for you too.<p>You probably support democratic control over the government where each citizen gets one vote. But very few Americans support democratic control over private corporations (that would be socialism after all). There are enormous numbers of such examples.<p>I think it is unreasonable to claim that because the constitution limits the state&#x27;s ability to restrict speech that Americans believe that other actors should not be able to restrict speech in places where they exhibit control. It certainly could be the case that Americans support free speech more broadly, but it definitely does not follow from just being in the constitution.')
