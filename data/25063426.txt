If someone posts &quot;I like guns and believe in the right to bear arms&quot;, that&#x27;s just not getting muted.  If someone posts &quot;I believe in the sanctity of human life and am anti-abortion&quot; that is not getting muted.  &quot;I believe in small government and low taxes.&quot;  Those are conservative political posts.<p>It&#x27;s not that conservative political posts are getting muted, it&#x27;s that <i>false</i> statements and <i>misinformation</i> are getting muted.<p>The fact that some people conflate the two is not the fault of Facebook or Twitter.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve made plenty of bad calls and neither service is angelic.  But I just don&#x27;t think the labeling &amp; muting phenomenon is what people think it is.<p>Anyway, maybe more places to have conversations is net net a good result after all.  Maybe all the world wasn&#x27;t meant to talk together in a common public square.')
