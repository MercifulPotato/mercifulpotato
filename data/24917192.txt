Item(by='MagnumOpus', descendants=None, kids=[24917232], score=None, time=1603880974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916506, text='&gt; What would be a better option? A presidency like in the US?<p>If you want to have a purely ceremonial head of state, it could still be an elected elder statesman rather than an aristo &quot;by god&#x27;s grace&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; right. I.e. the German&#x2F;Austrian&#x2F;Italian presidential model where the president exercises about as much real power as queen Liz (i.e. a once-a-year state of the union speech).<p>Or you go entirely without - since Liz refuses to use her corrective powers even in such blatant cases of procedural abuse like the proroguing of parliament, then the post is useless and the Prime Minister might as well be Head of State officially.')
