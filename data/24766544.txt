It smells like unilateral disarmament to me. If a warlord is rampaging through the countryside putting villages to the sword, it&#x27;s not good enough to say, &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t agree with stabbing people to death.&quot; It&#x27;s great if you have a plan to stop the pillaging without stabbing anyone, but if you don&#x27;t, then you need to consider plans that do involve stabbing, or at the very least fielding some stabbers. There may be times when all courses of action involve moral compromise, but inaction always favors the oppressor.<p>Do you have a plan for fighting copyright without using copyright? If yes, then I withdraw my objection. If not, then I ask you to consider whether using copyleft is better than nothing. The oppressive copyright system will continue doing damage without you.')
