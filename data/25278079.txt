We don&#x27;t use those ethical arguments when it comes to conduct that has a direct, near-immediate effect on other humans, and we give a handful of animals we have particularly positive feelings about a partial exception, but we <i>do</i> use them basically everywhere else.<p>&gt; &quot;But it just feels too good to give up! XD&quot; or &quot;But if I stop, everyone else is still going to do it, so why stop!&quot; aren&#x27;t arguments we&#x27;d level at the carnal pleasures of rape<p>These are exactly the kinds of things people say about why they still fly numerous times a year for leisure, why they&#x27;re driving a large vehicle they don&#x27;t need, and basically every other area where what people recognize as the ethical or societal ideal doesn&#x27;t match up with how they want to behave.<p>Most people recognize it&#x27;s not compatible with their ideals, but the vast majority still choose to do it anyway.')
