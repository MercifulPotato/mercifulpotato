Qualified individuals may be required to pay the entire premium for coverage up to 102% of the cost to the plan.&quot;<p>Yeah, no, that&#x27;s not the same thing at all. As a Canadian I have health coverage I can, y&#x27;know, live with regardless of whether I&#x27;m employed or not. And buying coverage in the US (with a pre-existing condition) was absolutely not worth it (even considering the wage gap) when I entertained a few offers in the early oughts.<p>Staying here means I have substantially better freedom of movement and negotiating power. In the US the &quot;freedom&quot; to not have healthcare just seems to mean that everyone has the &quot;freedom&quot; to pay more - and often for less.')
