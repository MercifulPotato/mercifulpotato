Telecom companies and their shareholders are burdened by debt and either go bankrupt or have horrendous returns.<p>2. The govt (and taxpayers) do not realize the revenue from spectrum auctions<p>3. Finally, the subscribers suffer under poor network infrastructure, towers and upgrades as the companies are hamstrung by spectrum debt and unable to raise cash.<p>The lose-lose-lose Nobel winning work does not stop the columnist Mihir Sharma, who is <i>also</i> an economist from playing fast-n-loose with his triumphant conclusion:<p><i>&quot;This is a well-deserved Nobel prize not because the bridge these economists built can be erected over any kind of river, but because it got built in the first place. The true miracle was the transparent, inclusive, academically informed process that led to its design. It ensured that the specific complexities of that market at that time were clearly reflected in the eventual auction design.<p>Market designers can’t give up because they haven’t been able to replicate that Nobel-worthy success. They need to work harder and think bigger.&quot;</i><p>Economists can never be wrong and even when they are they should be commended for their efforts even though other solutions exists - e.g. revenue sharing - which work very well. Top down market design is the highest virtue of all even though hundreds of millions of <i>very poor</i> people might have suffered for academic theories of a few.')
