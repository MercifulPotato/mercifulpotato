Conventionally the idea of free-market competition is that companies stand to gain if they succeed but have to eat the losses if they fail, and so competition eventually selects the best. But we&#x27;re not talking about making widgets or sandwiches or launch vehicles. Things like the ISS, JWST, etc are <i>all</i> one-off projects, and they <i>cannot</i> be allowed to fail, so competition doesn&#x27;t really help and the public is left holding the bag, just like we see in the endless cost overruns of politically unkillable DoD contracts.<p>&quot;Public bad private good&quot; isn&#x27;t a coherent strategy. If NASA isn&#x27;t good enough then the preference should be to improve NASA rather than to insert an unnecessary layer of profit-taking for SpaceX or Boeing to do the same thing anyway.')
