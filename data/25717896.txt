It&#x27;s particularly useful when names are in the same language as the base language (e.g. in English &quot;Peter&quot; is easily recognized as a name, but &quot;better fish&quot;  means something in the language, but can also be used as a proper noun, so using italics for proper nouns serves to disambiguate the intended meaning).')
