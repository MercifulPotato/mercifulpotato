Therefore, I have my touch bar set to activate only while I&#x27;m holding down the FN key.<p>I will not remove that safety key until they make the touch bar pressure sensitive so that &quot;buttons&quot; on it only activate with a similar amount of force that was required to activate the tactile buttons they replaced. Until then, I consider it a failed design improvement.')
