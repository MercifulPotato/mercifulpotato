Porsche has several models which are kind of you can take on normal roads for long drives <i>and</i> drive race track with great success&#x2F;fun. Basically 911s above 400 hp with rear wheel drive or best caymans. Not many in that category and price levels. Actually typical american muscle car is more in the &#x27;doesn&#x27;t make sense&#x27; category since whole added value is just straight line performance, not overall driving quality. Maybe too european view but definitely common.<p>They might be minority in terms of sales, but those folks are out there. And they drive new models too.')
