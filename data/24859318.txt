Its declared goal is to be electric-only, and they certainly seem to be making good progress on that. Sure, they&#x27;re not Tesla, but I think it&#x27;s unfair to compare them with Hummer.<p>[edit] here are their (public) goals: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volvocars.com&#x2F;intl&#x2F;why-volvo&#x2F;human-innovation&#x2F;electrification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volvocars.com&#x2F;intl&#x2F;why-volvo&#x2F;human-innovation&#x2F;el...</a><p>- Since 2019, all cars electrified, all cars available in &quot;plug in hybrid&quot; version<p>- 2020, launch full electric vehicles (they did, XC40)<p>- Their goal is 50% plugin hybrid, 50% full electric by 2025')
