The number of ballots needs to match the number of votes cast according to the voter rolls. Is your theory that someone requested 18,000 ballots to registered voters at 18,000 different addresses and then returned them with matching signatures and also somehow ensured that none of them tried to vote themselves, which would have been immediately flagged?<p>In all seriousness I think you should volunteer to be an observer for the next election and you will see how crazy this sounds.')
