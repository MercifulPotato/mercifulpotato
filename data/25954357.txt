My old thinkpad maxes out at 8gb, even though I could change the stick to a 16 or 32gb.<p>I don&#x27;t want to repair my device. I don&#x27;t want to upgrade my RAM, I want websites, OS and apps not to bloat. There is no reason that Facebook and Twitter don&#x27;t load instantly and are extremely snappy other than that they can.<p>If you want upgradeable machines, buy a desktop. You gave up most of the upgradeabliity when you brought a laptop.')
