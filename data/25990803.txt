But state is something that has to flow.\nSure you can pin it to a ref, make it mutable and change the state but then nothing prevents you to change the state \narbitrarily e.g. from a command. I believe yes the answer is because we want to stay on the FP realm. FP imposes some restrictions to keep our sanity. So not having a reference\nto the state and making it immutable is one of those restrictions.')
