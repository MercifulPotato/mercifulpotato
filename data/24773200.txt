Some sites generate 2 GB per hour just for logs, let alone users uploading TBs of videos. 1 TB sounds a lot but it isn&#x27;t. Imagine 4k security camera recording at 60 fps, 30 day back up videos, for 1 million customers. That&#x27;s about 120 Gb * 30 * 10 * 1 million = 36000000 TB of data every month. Now do duo backups just in case and you need 72,000,000 TB of space.')
