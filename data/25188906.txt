But I also agree with another downvoted post, in that this has become the expected behavior. I guess the point is that VC didn’t start this fire, it’s just the latest incarnation of what seems to be the endgame of capitalism. Proponents of capitalism sell a version of it where innovation and efficiency are rewarded through a kind of economic Darwinism where the fittest survive. But it isn’t hard to find examples that show it is capital itself that drives success and allows the unhealthy and unfit to prosper at the expense of superior competitors or even entirely alternative industries.')
