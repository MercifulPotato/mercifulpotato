They write that you can produce 20m segments of filament on a 30x30cm bed. That is already a somewhat large printbed, and 20m is not that much filament. So it seems like the use case would be small objects only.<p>3D printers can be very finicky, and I&#x27;d worry that the filament diameter and properties would be variable enough to cause issues here.<p>My impression is that multi-color printing is far more limited by the amount of effort one is willing to spend on tuning everything until it works than just money.')
