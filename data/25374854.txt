So no, it&#x27;s not fixed.<p>Second, a server you have to maintain, harwdare and software-wise, is much more complex, and takes much more time, than a managed service. You want a database? Install it yourself, maintain it yourself, backup it yourself, monitor it yourself. And same with everything else.<p>Third, there&#x27;s zero redundancy in your &quot;setup&quot;. If you want it with the most basic redundancy, you triple the costs (second server, extra networking equipment, etc.).<p>Fourth, geo redundancy&#x2F;distributedness? Please. Good luck if you have someone far away who wants to visit your site.<p>Fifth, let&#x27;s say you need to scale.

You&#x27;re looking at months and a lot of cash, upfront.<p>&quot;A big collection of bare-metal hypervisors&quot; makes sense in some cases, but don&#x27;t pretend it doesn&#x27;t come with a non-negligible time spent maintaning it and requires significant upfront capital and man hours to do the same  you get easily on a public cloud platform (databases, message brokers, object storage, etc. etc . etc. etc. etc. etc.).')
