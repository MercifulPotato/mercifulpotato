The corruption was on multiple levels, both the politician and the construction companies. Yeah the materials went missing and you could argue whether it was the workers who did it or on a more organized level. But construction managers were caught receiving huge amounts of money for contracts and the politicians wanted the airport open in 2012 totally pretending that any safety concern could be ignored. It&#x27;s not a good look at all. Maybe the level of corruption is lower, or maybe it just exists in a different form. Not sure.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gWYTnc7m9mE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gWYTnc7m9mE</a>')
