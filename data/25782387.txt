The comparison has been made to them being the shopping mall, and I think it&#x27;s apt.<p>&gt; Unilateral and permanent banning just creates more problems<p>Creating government red tape when swift action is needed to remove users who violate the rights of others or harm others is not the answer. The latitude service providers are given to remove objectionable content enables the internet to work quite well. From what I&#x27;ve seen, the biggest complaints of censorship are defending the indefensible, and for support of that claim I direct your attention to the evidence Amazon gathered in response to Parler&#x27;s lawsuit.<p>&gt; This gives platforms a scapegoat, &quot;the government won&#x27;t let me&quot;, but still allows the platform to do things like not list &quot;bad&quot; people in the &quot;discover&quot; feed and make better mute&#x2F;ignore features<p>If a shop that you&#x27;re forced to allow in your shopping mall is doing money laundering and arms trafficking, I don&#x27;t think the answer is &#x27;just remove them from your mall&#x27;s map while you file a lawsuit against them&#x27;.')
