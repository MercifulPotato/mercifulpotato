In that case, source data sets that were each well-regarded and, particularly in caniuse&#x27;s case, well-curated on their own became overwhelming and harder to use than before once combined. The slightly different styles for each source and the partial duplication often seem to obscure the information I&#x27;m really trying to get to in the search results now. If MDN is now going to be community-led, I hope they manage to find some arrangement where there is still decent curation and not a Wikipedia&#x2F;SO-style free for all followed by heavy-handed mod over-reaction.')
