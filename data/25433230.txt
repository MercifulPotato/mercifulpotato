Because to X both problems are equally hard -- namely impossibly hard.<p>Instead, like @dcolkitt indicated, X will look at how Q and F dress (better looking = better at mathematics), and which one has the most self confident voice?<p>(However in things like sports, when one clearly sees who, say, is the fastest runner, then it&#x27;s simpler of course.)')
