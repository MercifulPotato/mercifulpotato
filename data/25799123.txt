The first was that I felt like I was missing some CS theory that would help me in my programming. Second, It was important to me that I finish this difficult thing that I&#x27;d started a long time ago. And yes, there was some amount of anxiety that I didn&#x27;t measure up to my peers.<p>The first did come true as I moved through some of my coursework. Especially in my digital logic and final project courses where I was working very low level. The anxiety thing started to go away somewhere in the middle as I realized that no amount of signaling was going to make me feel better, because there&#x27;s always something more to learn and the pool of knowledge is both wide and deep.')
