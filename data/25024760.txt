They still have access to the transaction data, right? So they can build financial profiles on their users, as well as communications profiles (even if only metadata is available) since they dominate that market at well. Seems like a gold mine for intelligence operations. Are there laws mandating that the data has to stay on Indian servers and be insulated from the outside? Or maybe government&#x2F;public sector employees can’t use these foreign services (seems unlikely)?')
