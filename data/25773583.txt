Some group of people in comfortable offices look at a map, says &quot;yeah, I think this option is more favourable to us than peace&quot;. Then a war happens. It is all about incentives and capabilities.<p>One of the lessons from being a Stallman watcher for many years - people are <i>profoundly evidence based</i>. If there hasn&#x27;t been a war in 30 years, then they assume there will not be a war next year no matter how the background is changing.<p>The fading of WWII in the public memory could be argued as the biggest single risk that society faces. There are too many people who just won&#x27;t understand how bad and how possible total war is. There is a huge background risk that the age of abundance ends and then things get dicey.')
