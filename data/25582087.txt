When you&#x27;re a content creator and you&#x27;re making at most a couple of TB of data per month (typical figures), hardly enough to fill a handful of tapes a year, it&#x27;s hard to justify the expense for a tape drive. OTOH cloud storage is either too complex (S3, Glacier) or too expensive (Dropbox, Box) for this volume of data.<p>Trust: yep, hard to say for this one. At least I can provide actual guarantees (for instance, none of our storage is out of the country).<p>Speed: it&#x27;s possible to send us tapes directly. However the main selling point of our solution is to allow people to upload relatively small volumes of data continuously, then archive it all to tape in large batches when you have enough to fill an LTO.<p>Reliability: the interface allows the user to see where their files are (on which tape), to run checksum controls on tapes, and restore from tape. Every tape is sold with 3 free operations a year (archive, checksum verification, restoration).<p>Advertising: that&#x27;s clearly not our strong point :)')
