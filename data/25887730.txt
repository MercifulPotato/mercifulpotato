Most of the code for the sync, as well as these other internal APIs, is on Google&#x27;s backend and is very much closed source. The thin client code calling these APIs may have been in Chromium, but as a general rule of thumb, I wouldn&#x27;t really call Google Translate and Sync open source.<p>Google provides the code for Chromium, but I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s an expectation that they should also freely provide internal APIs which require backend servers. What other open source software provides such guarantees?<p>&gt; I wonder if they could in theory just grab the key from chrome<p>I saw some discussion of that in the discussion group. I believe it would break their terms and services for distros to do it, not sure if an individual could on their own though.')
