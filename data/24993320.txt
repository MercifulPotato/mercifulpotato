No-one is saying that a pig has the same moral standing as a human.<p>&gt; They aren&#x27;t people. Their &quot;feelings&quot; do not matter<p>So you believe that animals are just automata with no consciousness? That animal cruelty cannot exist even in principle, any more than cruelty to sand?<p>Descartes believed this. Today, we know better.<p>&gt; to call it &quot;horrific&quot; is a massive insult to the hundreds of thousands of people who work in that industry<p>This doesn&#x27;t address the matter of whether or not it&#x27;s cruel.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t care if the animals I eat were happy, because no matter what happens they are going to be killed and I am going to cook and eat their bodies.<p>Do you believe animals are conscious and capable of suffering, or not? Either way, it doesn&#x27;t matter that they die in the end. If animals are conscious, it doesn&#x27;t inform our morality that they are destined to die. People are also destined to die, but this doesn&#x27;t impact our moral obligation to care about their suffering. If animals are not conscious, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether they are destined to die.')
