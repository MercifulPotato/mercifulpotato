We would really like to give you a timeline, but I don&#x27;t want to promise anything and not deliver in a timely manner. Dynamic analysis and easy integration of dynamic information is important to the Ghidra community as is evidenced in the thread.<p>&gt;IMHO, I would not hesitate to learn&#x2F;use any tool, as the knowledge gained can always be ported to another tool. Time spent learning other debuggers, such as gdb or windbg, will not be wasted as the new Ghidra based debugger will be integrated with existing debuggers or have considerable overlap with their command sets and functionality. That said, if another tool fits your needs, use it. There are many great things about each RE tool and reasons to use or not use each.<p>&gt;Rest assured we are diligently working on the debugger and we think it will be worth the wait. We&#x27;ll share information on features and release when we have solid timelines.<p>&gt;Thanks for using Ghidra in whatever way fits your work. Feel free to request features&#x2F;improvements you see lacking and we and the community will try to address them.<p>&gt;We&#x27;ll close the issue for now.<p>--------------------------<p>Also from the What&#x27;s New 9.2 release notes:<p>&gt;Dynamic Analysis Framework - Debugger<p>&gt;The debugger is very much still in progress. You may have seen some commits, in the Ghidra GitHub master branch, to get in sync with the debugger. Stay tuned for more on the Dynamic Analysis Framework soon after the 9.2 release.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NationalSecurityAgency&#x2F;ghidra&#x2F;issues&#x2F;24#issuecomment-645425059" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NationalSecurityAgency&#x2F;ghidra&#x2F;issues&#x2F;24#i...</a>')
