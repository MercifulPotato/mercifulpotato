For starters, it would mean fewer flamewars.<p>They&#x27;re just tools, criticizing them is not &quot;hating&quot; and your liking them is no endorsement (for anyone other than you, anyway).<p>&gt; With low-code backend tooling and React, I can promise you I can make a better website than with just Python no matter how much Django template wizardry one can muster.<p>How can you &quot;promise&quot; this? How can <i>anyone</i> &quot;promise&quot; this? I&#x27;m not even sure I understood what you meant by this. Even more so in this case as the tools you mentioned are geared to different types of applications.<p>The only way I can parse this sentence is that you&#x27;re claiming that react is indisputably better at [not sure what you meant to do since you said &quot;website&quot; and a website doesn&#x27;t need a backend$, but you mentioned backend regardless] than any tool in [whatever other language&#x2F;framework, clearly, even if you&#x27;re using Python as example] and I&#x27;m gonna need a source on that one. It&#x27;s a pretty strong claim, assuming I didn&#x27;t misinterpret it.<p>$ Technically, a website doesn&#x27;t need a frontend either; it&#x27;s debatable whether a web<i>site</i> even needs javascript, but certainly not react, which is a library for creating web <i>applications</i>.')
