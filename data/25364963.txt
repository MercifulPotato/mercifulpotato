Never heard in Europe that you get paid more so you leave when they can boot you out for free and I talked to lawyers about this. The reasoning behind the generous safety nets in Europe is also to make it easier for employee-employer terminations in case it doesn&#x27;t work out. The laws here are that employers aren&#x27;t allowed to abuse you, force you into unpaid overtime, etc. but fire you for free they can otherwise nobody would dare become an entrepreneur&#x2F;investor in an environment where it&#x27;s impossible to fire someone.')
