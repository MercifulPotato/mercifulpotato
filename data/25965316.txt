We didn&#x27;t demo any other games once we got to it.<p>After class, I was not happy how many times it crashed but somebody corrected me - it was the only actual video game anyone made. Most were card games or guessing games.<p>Lost the source code because my floppy disk somehow got corrupted on the way home from the last day of school.')
