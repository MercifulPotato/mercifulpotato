The original Mobiscribe (which is just called the &quot;Mobiscribe&quot;, for anyone who&#x27;s confused) has major lag issues and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the note-taking unless you want to wait 30+ seconds at times, switching between virtual notebooks.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s partially due to bad coding that scales up poorly (the .note files have to re-render their vectors every time you turn the page, including completely erased parts), and it didn&#x27;t pop up until I&#x27;d owned it for a while.')
