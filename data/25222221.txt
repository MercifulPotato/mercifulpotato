And it&#x27;s unclear how they are gonna get one.<p>I&#x27;d pay more for ad-free access to Youtube than for a Netflix subscription. Maybe I&#x27;m suffering from the typical-mind fallacy, but because Netflix is a solid concern (current market cap, $214 billion), it looks to me like Youtube would continue to be a solid business if the hypothesized revolt by the common man and woman against ads materializes.')
