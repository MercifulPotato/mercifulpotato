I know, &quot;but it&#x27;s easier to make it faster in Julia&quot;. Last I checked `sort(df, :col)` was significantly slower than `df[sortperm(df[:col])]`. Someone actually has to go through and make these libraries fast.<p>Second issue, in my field (bioinformatics) the script is still a pretty common unit of code. Without cached compilation being a simple flag, Julia often is slower.')
