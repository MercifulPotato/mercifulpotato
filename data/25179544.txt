Section 230 covers providers interactive content and does so without exception. Whether a website or an app is &quot;essential infrastructure&quot; (whatever that means) or not has no bearing. Anyone or anything that hosts publicly accessible information to an electronic network regardless of the location or means. (satellite, underground collocation center, private home server) is affected, not just Silicon Valley.<p>In addition, no bank is required to give you a $1 loan even if you have an 850 FICO score. No electricity company is required to keep supplying you with 1 MWh of electricity a month even if you can pay for it. No rail company is required to get a consumer from A to B if the company doesn&#x27;t serve those areas or doesn&#x27;t want to. They&#x27;re not legally required to provide services to anyone and everyone indiscriminately. What they&#x27;re not allowed to do is pull a bait-&amp;-switch.<p>In short a company, CAN arbitrarily discriminate against you but cannot do so systematically, not withstanding a legal &quot;business interest&quot; exception.')
