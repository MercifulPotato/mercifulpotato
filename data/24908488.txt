It should be applied as often as possible. Either the law exists and is enforced, or the law should be repealed. In your hypothetical scenario, if I have crimes I&#x27;ve &quot;already committed&quot;, then those should have already been brought up.<p>But that&#x27;s sort of my point as well. I think we can come up with the regulations to avoid the situation you describe. It may involve what I suggested above, updates to statutes of limitation, etc.')
