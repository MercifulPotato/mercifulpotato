Item(by='adkadskhj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608132963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441025, text='I completely agree about &quot;spacial memory&quot; - i use my non-i3 WM in the same way.. but i&#x27;m not a fan of tiling in most cases. Does i3 still have tools i might find useful?<p>To further illustrate: I primarily have an open Terminal+Tmux for editing on my main monitor. On my side, i have spacial  <i>but overlapping</i> windows. They stick out a bit, such that it&#x27;s primarily four tabs - left,up,right,down. For example my Slack is on the left tab, and i can always see my contact list, people typing to me, etc. My Browser is usually on the Up tab, as it allows me to see the browsers tabs themselves. I do the same with Zoom on the bottom, such that my Mic (mute&#x2F;unmute) is always visible. And etc.<p>This arrangement perhaps isn&#x27;t ideal, but it&#x27;s better than a tile for me because in a tile, i lose so much real-estate that the window becomes near useless. I can&#x27;t shrink Slack to 1&#x2F;4 of my Monitor, it&#x27;s got too many boarders&#x2F;etc. Same goes for my Browser, most sites have non-collapsing sidebars and etc, a tiny 1&#x2F;4 window is useless.<p>This method of spacial layout obscures ~90% of my windows but leaves some of it always visible. In some cases that&#x27;s very useful. But this is something i manage through the day, and a WM to automate this positioning would be amazing.')
