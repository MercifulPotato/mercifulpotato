I think the terms &quot;ownership&quot; and &quot;move&quot; are confusing and what it really is &quot;responsibility&quot;.<p>&gt;  ...ownership&#x2F;move semantics is fundamentally based around the _responsibilities of values_ by tracking value usage.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; If we were to call Ownership Semantics a paradigm, it would be the orientation around the responsibility of values in a hierarchical fashion, placing emphasis on this system of responsibility, shifting focus from data structures and algorithms.<p>I am not a brilliant writer (which I already knew, even though loads of people have commented on that), but I was trying to get an idea I had in my head onto paper. I wanted to explain that this abstraction is not as good as it is being advertized and does have its limitations. It&#x27;s not a criticism of the concept, but its application to a bunch of problems.')
