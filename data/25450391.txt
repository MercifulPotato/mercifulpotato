Red Hat Inc. does not want people to build and&#x2F;or distribute gratis RHEL8 or clones. It would be trivial to just put the actual RHEL8 iso as an unsupported download on their ftp&#x2F;www server and sell the support separately, like Oracle or Canonical do. Instead, they kept this ridiculous make work project called CentOS around, that involved non-trivial manual labor meticulously rebranding RHEL into RedHat owned CentOS-the-laggard-RHEL-clone, whose users apparently mainly value it for being as close to RHEL as possible without paying. To a distant observer, the whole setup looks quite absurd. I think it&#x27;s actually good that they finally put an end to it. But they should have either not started CentOS 8 at all or rode it out till the end. Pulling the plug at 20% of it&#x27;s lifetime is plainly a shitty move.<p>2. It appears that building a legal RHEL8+ clone is quite a task, and I&#x27;m guessing the amount of work involved is largely controlled by Red Hat Inc. I.e., they can make running&#x2F;maintaining a project like Rocky or others more and more expensive if they choose to. I believe they going to test the limits of how difficult they can make building from their sources within the boundaries of the GPL. If you think I&#x27;m wrong, just put up a mirror of the RHEL8 (not CentOS8) SRPMs and see how long it stays up. Clearly they&#x27;re not acting in the spirit of the GPL, even if they are in the letter.<p>3. Given the previous points, I believe any project like Rocky is a losing proposition. If the &quot;community&quot; really values enterprise stability so much, better put the effort into an extra-stable-extra-LTS fork of Debian or even Ubuntu, and preparing for transition away from RHEL. Or just pay up, if you really believes the RHEL stability is so valuable. Clone projects are by necessity extremely dependent on actions of Red Hat Inc which has largely opposite interests. I don&#x27;t know why people would volunteer for that.')
