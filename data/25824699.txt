But as the years went by it proved to be more expensive and almost 5x deadlier than the Apollo stack.<p>The shuttle did make sense for some things it was never used (DoD influence there) and it was an incredible piece of technology. It was also the workhorse for a big part of the ISS. But then again, that all happened in LEO, and different things could have been achieved by just iterating over Apollo&#x2F;Saturn, in LEO and further away.')
