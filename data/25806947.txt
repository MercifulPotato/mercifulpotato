First, no matter how much math your students learned in their high school and college courses, you should expect to re-teach the concepts that are needed for your lesson. It needn&#x27;t be extensive, but your students will thank you for it.<p>Second, don&#x27;t introduce more than one hard concept at once. Asymptotes can be reviewed with pure math functions such as polynomials, but that&#x27;s as far as they got in high school math. Then there are the other &quot;interesting&quot; orders such as log(n) that can be introduced, and you can show graphically why they&#x27;re useful.<p>Now you&#x27;re ready to discuss the order of algorithms.<p>I&#x27;m not a computer scientist, but that&#x27;s how I learned it, and while I don&#x27;t remember all of the algorithms today, I still understand the derivations of their orders when I see them.')
