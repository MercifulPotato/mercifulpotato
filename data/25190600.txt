We are happy to release the speech recognition API service for developers. The SpeechText.AI API automatically transcribes speech to text and summarizes audio data with high accuracy in multiple languages. SpeechText.AI uses a combination of speech recognition and natural language processing models to auto-summarize your recordings and highlight key moments in discussion. The unique domain-specific speech recognition technology enables users to improve the accuracy of automatic transcription for industries such as finance, healthcare, legal, IT, HR, and others. The API can recognize multiple speakers and add word-by-word timestamps, punctuation, casing to transcription results. SpeechText.AI supports almost all common media file formats and can transcribe audio&#x2F;video files stored on your hard drive or files accessible over public URLs (HTTP, FTP, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).')
