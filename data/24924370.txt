You buy a limited license to use and replicate the binary for personal use.<p>You don&#x27;t &quot;buy&quot; anything but the physical medium the binary code shipped on. Transferring ownership of a medium containing the binary code to a third party (bought or otherwise) ends your license to use the binary, no matter if you retain a physical copy.<p>You also don&#x27;t have the right to use the binary in ways not covered by the license (e.g. reverse engineering outside of the given right to ensure compatibility). This may include executing a copy on more than one machine or by a third party.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s also a difference between violating licensing terms and such violations being persecuted criminally.<p>An individual might get away with it, but as soon as either commercial activity is so much as suspected or a company does it, there will be legal consequences in Germany, too.<p>Source: first hand experience with licensing audits in several companies involving multiple software vendors (not just Microsoft)')
