You haven&#x27;t adapted someFunction to work with futures at all - you&#x27;re simply not running it until all the futures are gone and only normal values remain which you then pass into it!<p>Imagine someFunction comes from a library so cannot be modified trivially, takes three values, and can run successfully with the first two completed values while the third completes. What would you write with map to do that?')
