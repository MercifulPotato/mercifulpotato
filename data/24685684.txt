Plus, if these companies have billions and billions of dollars to throw away at buying smaller competitors, surely they have enough money to create their own competitor. Not to mention this would actually create a new competitor in various markets rather than take one away from said market, which is what happens through an acquisition.<p>Also remember that large companies&#x2F;monopolies also hurt the jobs market - the fewer players that dominate an economy, the riskier that economy is and you have to bail them out, and also it puts downwards pressure on salaries for workers, because people have fewer options when switching jobs. It&#x27;s only conglomerates with which you have little margin to negotiate your salary, too.')
