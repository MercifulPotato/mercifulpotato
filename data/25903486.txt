Legally the CEO&#x27;s cannot suddenly decide to go off and do something else [1].<p>So the article is a bit off-base. It&#x27;s not the CEOs that we need to persuade to change tactic, but the shareholders.

Maybe we should be talking about this instead? An ethical fund with the specific aim of being an activist shareholder in Big Tech organisations?<p>[0]You could make the case that this is in the shareholders&#x27; best interests, but I doubt a court would agree.<p>[1]I have a feeling Zuckerberg is still a majority shareholder in FB, so maybe he can.')
