My points were to defend nationalism as a valid stance to hold and to justify the different treatments of humans.<p>Now...<p>&gt; ... I am naive idealist.<p>The problem with naive idealism is that it is ineffective.<p>First, what is justice, fairness? Okay, let&#x27;s say you arrive to a satisfying (to us) definition. Is it true to everyone all the time? Or simply true to everyone? I think you agree that it is not.<p>Why? Why does that guy over there think differently? Nurture and nature. Let us say that his inherited traits set him as neutral on the issue, why does he think differently still? Because, of nurture. What is nurture? Culture in its diverse forms. Family culture. Community culture. Etc. Do you still think culture is meaningless?<p>I am not against immigration. I believe in voting with your feet (going to where you think is best). I am a first generation immigrant by the way. Not a child of immigrants.<p>I have no hate for people of different backgrounds. You misunderstood me. I am currently taking online classes on the Chinese language and on Chinese culture. One of my best friends is Muslim. Another close friend of mine is Indian.<p>As citizen of a DEMOcratic country (demo comes from the greek for &quot;the people&quot;), I play a part in the government. Albeit in a minor way, I am part of the government. I am partly responsible for what it does. In counterpart, the government exists for me, the citizen. I take the personality and privilege to be citizen of a democratic country more and more seriously.<p>I did not aim to say that all immigrants are ungrateful, only that with a porous border, I end up allowing ungrateful immigrants.<p>&gt; Why should it be unfair?\nI did not make the world. I came to this conclusion regretfully. You do need not to sell to me the beauty of a fair world. Everyone is born to different circumstances, therefore everyone is unequal. Not only birth but culture. Last century, China once tried to eliminate the advantage of the upper class. They took their possession and gave them a status &quot;to receive lesser treatment&quot;. It was an inherited status. After roughly 40 years, they removed that status. Then later there was a study on the descendants of the persecuted class. They were in average in a better position than the descendants of those who had receive a &quot;to receive a better treatment&quot; status. I leave it up to you to make your own conclusion.<p>There is a nation&#x27;s culture, a family&#x27;s culture, a religion&#x27;s culture, etc. As many as there are groups you can identify with.<p>&gt;Or at least, why can&#x27;t we make it fairer?\nYou can. I intend to do it, to the extent that it is not deleterious to me.')
