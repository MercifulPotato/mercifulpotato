For instance, you can take your driving test (which is administered in both countries by an agency of the UK government) in Welsh, but not in Gaelic.<p>Similarly, a Welsh speaker in Wales can insist on using Welsh in court proceedings even if they are also fluent in English. A Gaelic speaker in Scotland can&#x27;t- an interpreter will be provided in the very rare case where a witness or party to a case speaks Gaelic but not English, just as if they only spoke Polish, Punjabi or Cantonese, but someone who is bilingual like the vast majority of Gaelic speakers is expected to use English.<p>In general, while Gaelic has some official status, it&#x27;s not an official language of Scotland in the same way as Welsh is an official language of Wales.')
