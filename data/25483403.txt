It does mean creating a new way of life based on play; in other words, a ludic conviviality<p>I can&#x27;t help but feel like this is a very naive view of how the world and people works, almost child like.<p>Large organizations of people capable of mass producing useful products efficiently will always out-compete everyone else and push the &quot;ludic&quot; workers to the side because they involve 1) selecting who can and can&#x27;t be part of the organization because the fun &quot;things that need doing&quot; will be in high demand and the others will need on the things that need doing that are as much if not more necessary and 2)it involves delaying and abstracting the direct reward of the work which is hard to put in play with any kind of reward system outside of money.')
