It says GC needs 5 times the memory as manual memory management for equivalent performance, 3 times the memory for about equivalent performance.<p>Of course, that paper isn’t about reference counting. I think reference counting should see the same alloc&#x2F;free patterns as manual memory management, but with larger allocation sizes, to accommodate for a reference count in every object allocated. Even if that, on average, doubles the allocation size, that 5 and 3 still would be 2½, respectively 1½.<p>That logic may be broken, but I also notice that iPhones typically have less memory than Android phones, yet seem to do well in reviews. That, too conflates variables, so GCvs Reference Counting may not be a big factor, but if not, what is the reason?')
