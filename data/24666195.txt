None. None of my family members were sick or got sick - neither did I come into contact with anyone who was sick...<p>There are 2 theories, either I got the flu and my immune system just took care of it and it went away, leaving me with this condition OR that I was trying to bench 2 plates (45 lb * 4) and did something that might have damaged the olfactory bulb as I did feel a rush of blood enter the middle of my head.<p>The problem with trying to pinpoint this is that you don&#x27;t realize it right away, it takes a couple of days to realize that, hey maybe I should have been smelling something now?<p>I can only smell very intense scents - normal smell is gone... feels really weird as I am only in my mid 20&#x27;s.')
