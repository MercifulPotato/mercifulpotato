It&#x27;s highly expected that one can be created, but they&#x27;re not rolling off a production line right now.<p>There definitely wasn&#x27;t one 10 years ago, nor were superconducting tapes expected to become viable.<p>So what exactly do you think anyone would have been building if we were investing in fusion 10 years ago? What would &quot;hundreds&quot; of small scale devices be if we tried to build them today? With a technology that is being kept proprietary and this unavailable for use?<p>Again: we have a whole bunch of small scale fusion devices. This is what the article here is talking about! And until very recently all of them suggested the same thing: you need an ITER sized reactor to be able to get suitable mean free paths, and that Q is going to be all about the b dynamic manipulation of plasma at scale (which is what ITER is setup to study).')
