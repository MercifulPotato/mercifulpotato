One thing I can’t stop thinking about though is how utterly hopeless we are at creating good regulations. The regulations seem to have good intentions but end up doing more harm than good, often ending up giving even more of an advantage to the big tech companies.<p>Look at GDPR, it’s resulted in a tidal wave of horrible pop ups across the entire web that create the worst user experience ever. Apple probably loves this, it makes their Apple News product look amazing because in comparison it’s so slick and smooth, but it’s not at all web-like since you can’t link to articles.  So the open web takes a massive hit.<p>Same with content filters, only the big guys can afford to have them, so they gain a massive advantage. There doesn’t appear to be a way to make good regulation, so why bother at all?')
