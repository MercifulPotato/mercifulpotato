I lost a number of friends because I was so convinced I was morally correct and they were wrong on topics like immigration and capitalism.<p>I can sympathize. It&#x27;s worse off in Canada. We literally watched far left stuff in school. Not once did they ever show anything even marginally conservative.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m aware of a few cases now where subscribers of TYT have killed people, but it&#x27;s hard to know how direct those conncetions are.<p>I did not know that. Are you refering to Armenian Genocide or like TYT channel has created violent antifa type people?<p>&gt;I know for me TYT definitely misled me and caused me to believe everyone who didn&#x27;t share my views were evil and I have wondered before what I might have done had I been a violent person.<p>I too saw many of their videos years ago and they made lots of sense. They quite wrongfully portrayed Republicans as all nazis and KKK. Or at least a minimum of racists. Mind you, I&#x27;m not American nor do I live there. I don&#x27;t particularly care about the republicans. For all I know they are all racists.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t really know what the answer to this is. I know for me YouTube was also part of my deradicalisation process. Listening to people like Sam Haris allowed me to shift into the centrist I am today.<p>I followed Sam before TYT era mainly during the Hitchens and Dawkins time. Sam is very smart but I&#x27;ve been listening to him lately and boy is he ever deranged on Trump. I suppose every president has the Clinton Crazies equivalent. It&#x27;s very interesting to see Sam not rational about Trump.<p>Everyone is vulnerable to this radicalization.<p>The interesting thing, the very first republican president. Lincoln. He has a policy of like Ben Franklin. &quot;Speak ill of no man, but speak all the good you know of everybody.&quot;<p>Yet he had a derangement like no other. Ended up creating a civil war and getting assassinated.<p>&gt;I know often findings like this are followed by calls for censorship, and it does bother me today when I see content online obviously lying or misleding people about news stories to push a certain narrative.<p>That&#x27;s completely happening. Even wikipedia has politically sided. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;larrysanger.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;wikipedia-is-badly-biased&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;larrysanger.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;wikipedia-is-badly-biased&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;I&#x27;m personally not convinced censorship is the right answer.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not. Here in Canada we absolutely have extensive censorship. VPNs are becoming increasingly popular for Canadians.')
