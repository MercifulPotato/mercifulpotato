We as a country need to disincentivize lawyers from filing lawsuits like this. There should be a limit based on how many hours they work, etc. Lawyers fees should be negotiated on top of the settlement, it&#x27;s one of the reasons why our country is the way it is, lawyers trying to make a huge payday.')
