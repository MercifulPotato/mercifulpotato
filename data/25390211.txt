Currently &quot;cheaper than X&quot; models don&#x27;t account for such overcapacity factors. If there&#x27;s no wind in summer and no insolation during winter you&#x27;ll have to overbuild <i>each</i> by a factor of 5 or so and then build short-term storage on top of that. Conversely that means the bar to meet now is <i>(renewables + storage) &lt; fuel-based &#x2F; 5</i>.<p>That&#x27;s a rather fat margin. And things would be a lot cheaper overall if we could shave that off with some long-term storage.')
