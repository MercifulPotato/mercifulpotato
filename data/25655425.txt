It&#x27;s marketing and you&#x27;re falling for it. ProtonMail doesn&#x27;t have stellar record for privacy (or any Swiss company in general). There has been several discussions about this on HN, and otherwise where many have compared email services and rated their privacy claims. FastMail seems to be the worst of all. Migadu seems to be good but an extremely bad value for your $.<p>Stick with Google. It&#x27;s not fashionable but a bargain. You&#x27;re commodicized on the internet unless you run your own services. Don&#x27;t let any marketing fool you.<p>I&#x27;d rather be in iron clad hands of Google&#x27;s engineering and security practices than a 30 people company with no fricking clue about security. This is often not part of the discussion.')
