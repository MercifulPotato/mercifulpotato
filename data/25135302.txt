Thus, we think of the &quot;standard&quot; salary as what they pay in San Francisco, and ask for everyone to be paid that.<p>But the advantage of a remote workforce, from the employer&#x27;s point of view, is 1) getting the brilliant people who can&#x27;t leave their hometown to work for you, and 2) not having to pay San Francisco salaries. If you&#x27;re an incredibly gifted talent, you&#x27;ll fall into category 1 and they will pay you the San Francisco pay regardless of your location (or you can find an employer who will). But if your contribution is shipping high quality, but fundamentally non-novel, Node apps or similar, you&#x27;ll find that the &quot;standard&quot; salary is that which is paid in Timbuktu, and if you&#x27;re sitting in San Francisco and want more, you&#x27;ll have to provide your employer with a compelling reason, or they&#x27;ll just opt to hire a second person in Timbuktu instead.')
