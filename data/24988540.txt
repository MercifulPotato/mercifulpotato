So currently, it would be a trade war with China too.<p>This brings up something that I don&#x27;t understand. How can there be candidates that say they support the environment, support worker rights, and support free trade with places such as China? Laborers are treated like crap and pollution is rampant in China. Promoting free trade seems to oppose the other two positions since there&#x27;s more pollution in the developing nations that we outsource out manufacturing to and that labor in our country can&#x27;t compete with the lower wages of those developing countries, partly due to lower living standard but also due to fewer worker protections and even safety equipment.')
