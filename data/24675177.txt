Item(by='Baeocystin', descendants=None, kids=[24677282], score=None, time=1601764438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674557, text='I don&#x27;t want to get in to too much detail on a public board, but the short of it is that several major events in rapid succession (unexpected death of my father, lawsuits involving his estate, Covid just as I was re-growing my IT business, loss of several major clients&#x2F;income security due to same, a sudden chronic health problem, etc, etc, etc, etc.) overwhelmed my ability to get things done in a timely manner. I sought help, and something in the way I was talking must have piqued my psychiatrist&#x27;s attention, I got tested, and here we are.<p>It was a <i>lot</i> of shit, all at once, and it would be easy to shrug and say it would have been hard for anyone.  But it was enough of a shock to my abilities that I was able to finally see that I just wasn&#x27;t firing on all cylinders, even though I am otherwise intelligent and capable.<p>I have <i>not</i> lost my ability to focus.  In fact, it&#x27;s easier than ever.  I&#x27;ve always been very distractible (another common symptom), and suddenly the kids making noise while playing next door, dogs barking, phones ringing  no longer wreck the house of cards I&#x27;m holding in my mind while working on a problem.  It&#x27;s remarkable.')
