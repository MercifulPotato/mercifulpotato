Item(by='u801e', descendants=None, kids=[24927565], score=None, time=1603947529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926827, text='&gt; I honestly never fully understand how to read the maillist patch. The plain text format makes it very hard to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>That may be due to the settings in your mail client.  If it&#x27;s displaying plain text in a variable width font and&#x2F;or not applying syntax highlighting in terms of showing added and removed lines in different colors, that would make the diff more difficult to read.<p>But some mail clients can do that and it makes reading the diff much easier.<p>&gt;  I&#x27;m sure I will understand it better or even prefer it if I use it long enough, but then again I can instantly understand code reviews on GitHub&#x2F;GitLab&#x2F;Gerrit.<p>Essentially, code reviews in a mailing list are much like a discussion thread in Hacker News or Reddit where the thread structure is very similar.  The only difference is that most mail clients only allow you to display one message at a time.<p>In my mail client, Thunderbird, you can see the overall thread structure of a patchset discussion.  This is the root message for the thread which serves as the cover letter (which is the equivalent of the PR description) [2].  The first commit in the patch is displayed here [3] (note that I have a plugin that enables diff syntax highlighting).  The email subject is the commit message title (with the [PATCH v2 1&#x2F;3] tag prepended to it).  The commit message itself is the beginning of the email, and the diff follows.<p>Unlike Github (and maybe Gitlab), the commit message and diffstat is treated at the same level as the diff itself.  That means you can comment on it just like you would on the diff.<p>Here, you can see the Junio C Hamano&#x27;s comments on the second commit in the patch set [4].  He&#x27;s commenting on the diffstat line which shows 391 lines lines added to the builtin&#x2F;submodule--helper.c file.  Further down in the same message [5], he&#x27;s commenting on the code inline, much like someone would quote a message here on HN and reply inline to multiple sections of it.  It&#x27;s not really that different compared to comments on a diff in Github or Gitlab other than the fact that it&#x27;s a reply to an email message rather than a web page.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;QmqUWR8.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;QmqUWR8.png</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;mILREtf.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;mILREtf.png</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;gdoy5zs.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;gdoy5zs.png</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;BcTdRRe.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;BcTdRRe.png</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;cCpqsOL.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;cCpqsOL.png</a>')
