They already both moved the memory controller onboard so they had the opportunity to aggressively optimize it like Apple has done, but instead we have year after year where the memory lags behind the processor in speed improvements, to the point where it is ridiculous how many clock cycles a main memory access takes on a modern x86 chip.')
