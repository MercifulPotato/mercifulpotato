Seeing as the project is about 5 years old, i didn&#x27;t entirely agree. Even linked the rule of threes, but the coworker remained adamant that consistency trumps everything.<p>I&#x27;m not sure, maybe they have a good point? However, jumping through extra hoops just because the software is a large enterprise mess doesn&#x27;t seem that comfortable either, just because someone decided to do things a particular way 5 years ago. It feels like it&#x27;d be easier to just switch projects than try to &quot;solve&quot; &quot;issues&quot; like that (both in quotes, given that there is no absolute truth).')
