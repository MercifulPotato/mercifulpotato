Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609595213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612411, text='For quite some years now the rule for Companies House is that a director may provide an office address and that&#x27;s what is shown in the public records. Companies House will still ask for their home address, but it isn&#x27;t public.<p>There are actually three levels: A public address available to anybody who knows how to enquire, an address available to a large number of authorised users, including Credit Reference Agencies, numerous government agencies and so on, and finally a home address intended primarily for law enforcement (e.g. if the director is to be arrested it wouldn&#x27;t do for police to have no idea where they live). You can set them all to be the same, but you don&#x27;t have to.<p>The reason for the last extra grade is that in the UK there are businesses which are legal but broadly unpopular. For example, somebody is breeding animals that will be used for medical research. Historically protesters have harassed the directors of firms like that, vandalized their homes and cars, physically attacked them, or threatened their lives. Such directors are entitled to request that their home addresses be suppressed from most uses for this reason.')
