Then you include the $100 Global Entry credit as well as Lyft benefits (10x points on Lyft + Lyft Pink sub)and it starts to &quot;pay for itself.&quot; They&#x27;re also offering $120 in credits to Peloton Digital subscriptions right now. Seeing the $550 charge on the statement isn&#x27;t always fun but I think the benefits can start to make sense if you take advantage of them.')
