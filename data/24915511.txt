However there are certain markets where the sellers, for example book publishers, are totally at the mercy of amazon because they have become the only de facto distribution channel for certain products like e-books (there are others as well).

Technically this is known as a &quot;monopsony&quot; but it&#x27;s bad just in the same way a monopoly is.')
