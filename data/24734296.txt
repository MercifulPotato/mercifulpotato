I also have a TCF account from my childhood and the difference is so stark.<p>Schwab has a US based super super helpful call center. They will talk to visa on your behalf and fix any problems immediately. They will go out of there way to be very nice and helpful. they&#x27;ve waived wire fees for me when they had very little reason to. So amazing.<p>You can&#x27;t even get a human on the phone at TCF and they even recently got rid of local branch phone numbers you can&#x27;t find it - which is insane.')
