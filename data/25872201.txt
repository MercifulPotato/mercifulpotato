Glad to see someone else had the same idea and did the due diligence to collect a good chunk of these. I&#x27;m bootstrapping something consumer facing now, but I&#x27;ve of course thought about &quot;pivoting to B2B&quot; if the opportunity plays out. It&#x27;s nice to remember that these channels provide ample concrete space to help figure out the distribution side of things beyond paid acquisition. Now paid acquisition is great and all for VC backed companies, but for indie hackers, listening to and iterating &#x2F;based&#x2F; off of the channel itself seems to be a real lifeline. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the marginal acquisition costs that would otherwise price you out of the game entirely.<p>Looking at a couple of comments here, I&#x27;m seeing some eye popping figures from folks who pulled off using channel marketing for their SaaS.
