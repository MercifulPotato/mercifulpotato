Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605867413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157771, text='<i>&gt; Lots of people do this as a hobby - getting paid for a hobby is a very good way to make it not fun anymore.</i><p>This is true, but I don’t particularly like having my work thought of as a “hobby.” In the last three years, I’ve worked harder than I ever did, for a paycheck. I also feel as if the result of that work is the finest-quality software I’ve ever written.<p>My GitHub Activity Graph is solid green (and absolutely <i>not</i> “gamed”)[0]. I code every single day; often a <i>lot</i> of coding. It’s all been unpaid. The work I got paid for, never got into the public domain.<p>I’m currently working in closed-source, but the main reason is for a marketing embargo that will eventually lift (might be awhile, though. It’s a not-small effort). Nothing particularly proprietary or extreme. Most of my work is fairly pedestrian.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY#github-stuff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY#github-stuff</a>')
