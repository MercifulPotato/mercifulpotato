Dig into the news reports.  China is arbitrarily blocking Australian imports of wine, seafood, coal based on “irregularities” that require “inspection” that amazingly results in product spoilage.<p>China is turning the screws on Australia for past transgressions.  China makes up a huge percentage of Australian exports so it’s not hard for China to economically hurt Australia at little cost to themselves.<p>Watch how it plays out.  It will be eye opening.  My opinion is this is a test case and an attempt to split Australia off from the western group of countries.')
