Things like the Patriot Act get passed after 9&#x2F;11 and are still with us today.  The authorization for war given to Bush in 2001 is still active today, several presidents later, and has been used to kill and torture people in a whole host of countries.  Figurative &quot;wars&quot; have resulted in erosion of rights - like the war on drugs - which gave us expanded civil asset forfeiture.<p>Covid-19 has given the governors a pass to do anything they like with little to no oversight.  Banning any gathering of people is totally fine apparently.  It&#x27;s also seemingly fine to only use it against gatherings that are opposed to your political objectives, while those that you support are given a pass.  Banning the expression of one&#x27;s religion is also ok.  (In my state all places of worship were forced closed, no matter what precautions they took, but vape stores were deemed essential businesses.  I&#x27;m an atheist but this even bothered me.)<p>Maybe this is all perfect reasonable given the crisis -- but once these newfound powers are let out of the bag, we often find that they&#x27;re hard to pull back.')
