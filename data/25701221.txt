It&#x27;s fair to say &quot;we were influenced by (this other language that originated an idea)&quot;, but it&#x27;s also fair &quot;and Haskell also has that feature&quot;. Do it enough times, and you start to see why the claim that Haskell is important; being a research language it&#x27;s able to have all of these ideas implemented in it in pursuit of its design goals, where other FP languages pick and choose in pursuit of a different one.')
