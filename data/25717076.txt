Linode, Digital Ocean, and Vultr will be far more competitive and offer faster machines, cheaper, and with better bandwidth pricing.<p>The point of using AWS&#x2F;AZ&#x2F;GCP is to leverage their managed service portfolio and be locked in.  If you aren&#x27;t doing that, there are better companies that want your business and will treat you much better.')
