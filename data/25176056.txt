They talk about startup failures amongst other things. But it provides some semi regular blogs on start ups that went bust and why. I believe that there&#x27;s a lot to learn from someone else&#x27;s mistakes. And there are some that are also quite hilarious like the one in Juicer.<p>However, it isn&#x27;t a magazine or a journal per se.\n The link is failory.com')
