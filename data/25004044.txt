Maybe such considerations should have been made when britain joined the EU - I voted for brexit, but I had no choice on whether to join. It&#x27;s been argued that the current generation has no right to make such an impactful action as brexit, but why is it such that a single generation can sign up to such an alliance without an exit plan in the first place?<p>&gt; expert politicians could act on the public&#x27;s behalf in complex arrangements<p>And yet do they? How much does the public trust the motivations of their politicians? It seems to me that the public inherits an old and cludgy system, and you&#x27;d have to spend multiple lifetimes fighting it to have a chance of change. That the majority needed to accept the leadership of a clown like Boris shows how little the political class represents its public.<p>&gt; funded heavily by a Russian<p>As opposed to public funds? Or English oligarchs?<p>There are many factors that could affect the vote; having a goverment that represents, rather than manipulates, the public for instance.<p>&gt; without simplistic populism<p>What about simplistic dismissals of brexit as racist&#x2F;xenophobic. So many characterisations of the EU as the spirit of cooperation; where is the scepticism towards large political unions, democratic divide and conquer, and the forgotten fact that the EU is <i>still</i> an elitist institution despite whatever diversity you might think it has.<p>&gt; economic experts, the scientific experts, the political experts, the legal experts<p>There are winners and losers in brexit. The biggest losers tend to be lower paid, lower class demographics who where fed promises (lies) about how joining the EU would help them somehow. The biggest winners are businesses who can squeeze those lower classes, and middle class professionals (who started off with greater mobility in the first place). Guess which camp economists, scientists, politicians and lawyers fall into...<p>&gt; Convincing people through lies to vote against their own interests isn&#x27;t democracy<p>Who convinced people through lies? And since when is that acted on? I dont recall anyone suggesting we be able to kick out Thatcher when she turned on the miners. The issue is, the public don&#x27;t seem to get to decide when to hold a referendum, nor control the narrative of whether it is appropriate to do so; hence thd suggestion yhe Brexit is based on lied, when in fact any&#x2F;all referendums are.<p>In any case, how does brexit relate specidically to that. For whatever democracy is worth the EU will fix nothing of the rot in britain or its politics, but joining the EU is likely to make it worse. Reforming the electoral system might be a start, hopefully both Tories and neo-tories aka labour will die, but that&#x27;s a scope beyond.')
