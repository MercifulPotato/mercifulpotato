There are plenty of unscrupulous doctors who will find an excuse to do it, although they usually require you to buy the testosterone through their store.<p>It&#x27;s a total racket.<p>Be warned: Going on TRT should be considered a one-way street. Once you start adding exogenous testosterone to your system, your body&#x27;s natural production will decrease. It doesn&#x27;t take long for your body&#x27;s natural production to virtual stop completely, making you dependent on TRT for the rest of your life.<p>There are hypothetically ways to try to counter this shutdown, but it&#x27;s far from guaranteed. Many people who start and then stop TRT end up with lower levels than when they started, even with the countermeasures in place.<p>No man should experiment with testosterone unless they&#x27;re ready to continue using it for the rest of their life. I know plenty of people who thought they were getting a leg up in their 30s by getting on TRT, who now regret having to constantly buy and maintain TRT supplies and carry it around whenever they travel. The initial euphoric effects of TRT will wane over time, too.')
