I don&#x27;t know of any uses that are so small as to not need functions outside of some extremely small&#x2F;simplified models for explanatory purposes.<p>There is also symbolic mathematics that Mathematica really excels at although it&#x27;s pretty good at a lot of things these days.<p>If someone just needs fast code to loop through some data, they should be able to use whatever compiled or JIT language they see fit. Heck, it sounds like bash&#x2F;ask might even fit this use case if the code is so small as to not need functions.')
