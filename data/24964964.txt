Of course, they call it &quot;compliment sandwich&quot; instead.<p>The really soft shit sandwich is when somebody opens with superfluously thanking you for attending a scheduled meeting, then attempts to attack you. They think they have to thank you as the first layer of their shit sandwich, before the garbage layer. Of course, it sounds ridiculous to hear somebody thank you for doing nothing except showing up.<p>The reason for such &quot;training&quot; is that there is an epidemic of staff complaints against each other. It does keep HR staff busy (fullly-employed), but it also causes attrition.')
