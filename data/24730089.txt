Conversely, once your program compiles, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the compiler anymore when running the binary - you <i>know</i> your program is compiled effectively.<p>A Julia program, on the other hand, will run just fine if the compiler can&#x27;t figure out the types at compile time. It will just infer whatever it can, run that, and then use runtime values when it needs to. That&#x27;s a big plus for people like me where performance doesn&#x27;t matter 95% of the time, but it&#x27;s a bit of a performance trap for newbies.<p>Almost all cases of people complaining about Julia being slow come from them inadvertantly writing code the compiler can&#x27;t infer properly. Luckily, Julia has interactive tools to check the inference of functions. In my experience, once you get used to writing Julia, it&#x27;s rare that you accidentally write non-inferrable code.')
