It is a very good platform, but as time passes, I realized I wanted to be more in control of my projects.<p>Yesterday, I moved about 250 repos away to a gitea instance. Transition required a bit of tinkering (a few scripts) but went smoothly.<p>The good sides are:<p>- very fast, a lot faster than github for pushing&#x2F;pulling but also the web UI is a lot faster<p>- I&#x27;m in total control, I can change the look of the UI, create as many orgs as I want to organize my reposâ€¦<p>Now the cons:<p>- No social network effect, I don&#x27;t know how contributions to my projects will evolve<p>- Subject to DDoS and the like, I need to keep my instance accessible because I moved my FOSS projects on it<p>Maybe more, it&#x27;s been one day only.<p>I am not suggesting all project should move out of github, it is a very good tool, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t be bad to rely less on it.')
