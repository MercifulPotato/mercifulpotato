You can just say &#x27;despite what Tesla fans believe&#x27; as an argument. One datapoint from google 10 years ago is not really convincing.<p>Specially as car also gets better at measuring human attention. CommaAI pilot is already doing quite well on that. Tesla is working on it internally as well.<p>And also, we can do things like assess the situation and adjust necessary attention. If you are by yourself driving threw the desert, you can relax the condition. If you are in a city the car keeps you honest.<p>That this will clearly cause more accidents then human by themselves is not at all clear.')
