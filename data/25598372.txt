Actually spent a fair bit of time on offshore rigs and in shipyards. Fairly fun place to spend a few years but very little real culture--some jazz aside--as the wealthy were too busy planning their Mardi Gras balls. And to a local, Mardi Gras was mostly a zoo. Left after a few years to get another grad degree, which was pretty much my plan from the start.')
