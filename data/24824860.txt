She uses it to answer a question like “is he on his way home &#x2F; can I start supper?” or “he’s normally home 3 hours ago, has he even left work yet?”. And generally only once I’ve not responded to her just asking me.<p>If I wanted to go buy her a surprise gift I’d just tell her beforehand “got some errands to run after work be a couple hours late” or walk out on a weekend and say “running to the store, back in a couple hours”.<p>In that case unless I take way longer than I figured and don’t check in or respond to her checking in she has no reason to check where I am.')
