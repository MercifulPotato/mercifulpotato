Saladin is revered by khilafist Muslims who wish to reunite the Muslim world under one Islamic government. There&#x27;s a lot of overlap between this group and groups proscribed by the US government.<p>Guarantee most Muslims have no idea that Saladin was ethnically Kurdish or think that that matters. Most Muslims don&#x27;t even know anyone Kurdish or care about Kurds. The Kurdish story is really only told much in the West because they were allies with the West in all the last two decades&#x27; wars.<p>I&#x27;ll bet the house that YouTube noticed lots of channels promoting Saladin are also heavily populated with videos praising groups with similar aims as Saladin but which are proscribed by the US govt (don&#x27;t wanna say names for obvious reasons)')
