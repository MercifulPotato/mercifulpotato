In the one to three months between full vaccination of vulnerable individuals and drastically reduced R due to general vaccination, is a variant of the virus going to appear that will be able to effectively infect vaccinated people and spread enough for the pandemic to continue?<p>The answer to this is very probably no. There is a huge difference between the virus making the vaccine less effective eventually, the virus making the vaccine less effective within one to three months, and the virus making the vaccine sufficiently less effective that it can sustain an epidemic among vaccinated individuals. The second is not very likely at all, because for it to happen a variant of the virus would have to mutate, and outcompete the dominant variant, that has a spike protein sufficiently different that it can keep R&gt;1 among vaccinated individuals.<p>For this, the virus would not only have to evade antibody response sufficiently for there to not be sterilizing immunity, but it would have to do evade the much swifter and effective non-serological immune response enough to stay infectious.<p>All of this would have to happen in a subset of the population that has a 20x lower chance of being infected and even when that happens, the infection would be much shorter with most of it with completely different evolutionary pressures.<p>In one to three months.<p>It would also have to compete effectively against other variants in the non-vaccinated population while it is doing so, because non-vaccinated people are by very far the dominant infection vector. So it would have to evolve this not only in vaccinated, but also non-vaccinated patients, unless you believe that these extensive mutations will happen in one, vaccinated, patient, which is pretty much impossible.')
