This has been pointed out several times now.<p>You&#x27;re right from the point of view of a GUI application developper, the UNIX core is somewhat hidden under intermediate layers, but then it&#x27;s also the case for applications on Linux. Using GTK or QT, you don&#x27;t deal with low-level kernel APIS much beyond POSIX either. And you can also do that on macOS, so it&#x27;s a bit pointless as a purity test.<p>It seems difficult to argue with a straight face that Apple&#x27;s developers working on the kernel, low-level layers and system libraries don&#x27;t care about UNIX: that is their whole job. And as a user, you can have UNIX <i>and</i> decent GUIs.')
