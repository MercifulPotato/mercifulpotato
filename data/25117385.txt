We both know that&#x27;s not going to happen. Given that, can you explain why you think the world would be a better place when emails can be repudiated? When emails can be not be repudiated, innocent people can be framed for saying&#x2F;doing things that they didn&#x27;t do. DKIM protects innocent people from being framed. DKIM also protects innocent people against guilty people who commit frauds or other crime.')
