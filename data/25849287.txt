A few of the engineers trusted me and a couple select customers &#x2F; sales guys knew they could come to me to run a bug by me &#x27;in theory&#x27; and if we had enough information I could unofficially run it by engineering without going through the song and dance of the typical support channels.<p>I could get a quick ya or nay form them on some things and it was so much faster for everyone involved.<p>If it was a ya, I knew we had something, still more work to do but the case would skyrocket through the usual channels and engineering was engaged and ready.<p>If it was a nay, the usual channels it went and everyone was ok with that.<p>The engineers would give me a few minutes knowing I wasn&#x27;t going to bring them poorly thought out garbage, I would limit the rate of these special situations, and special customers &#x2F; sales guys could get the job done way faster.<p>It was a well known process by those who knew about it... but not everyone knew.')
