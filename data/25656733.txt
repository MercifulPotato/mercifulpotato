Item(by='jacobion', descendants=None, kids=[25656919], score=None, time=1609932367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656448, text='I think there might be two things going on here: one is a rise in various forms of social inequality, between generations, between people living in tier one cities and smaller cities or towns, between workers in certain industries and the rest. I tend to think this is bad, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s related to interest rates.<p>The other is the culmination of a fifty-year process set in motion when Western economies went from gold-backed currency to fiat currency, and then from political control of currency to independent Central Banks. During this period both inflation and interest rate have moved monotonically downwards, essentially both to zero.<p>What if you assume that this state of affairs is strange because new, but perfectly benign, and will last indefinitely? It&#x27;s absolutely true that those people who bought housing and other assets when rates were 10% have profited from a huge windfall. However, it&#x27;s a <i>one-off</i> windfall. They simply got a discount, because 20&#x2F;30&#x2F;40 years ago, borrowing long term to pay cash was hugely burdensome. Today&#x27;s homebuyers will buy assets at prices which reflect low interest rates, and they will pay low interest rates on their loans. As young workers, they might actually be better off in the long run. In a long term regime of zero rates, more of society&#x27;s wealth is going to producers (and risk-takers), less is going to people who just hoard cash.<p>You might think it&#x27;s nice for society to do something to correct this one-off inequality. Maybe so, but it&#x27;s not fundamentally different to the other inequalities which exist. In particular, it&#x27;s unclear why either artificially raising rates or artificially raising inflation are the solution. Neither of these are particularly effective in helping people who have got the short end of the stick. Both benefit some groups of rich people and some groups of poor people, and harm some other groups. There are much better solutions which can be pursued by governments directly without political interference in currencies.<p>Of course the type of person (job, family status, education level) who could buy a house in Berlin or London in the 1990&#x27;s could not buy that same house today. You can either say &#x27;too bad, you were out competed&#x27;, or you can try to do something about it: pay teachers and social workers more, build more houses, make smaller cities more desirable to live in, provide better training and career opportunities etc. Blaming this on the dubious idea that cash in the bank should accrue 8% interest per year lets governments off the hook for actually solving the problems, and just advocates a different set of inequalities and broken incentives.')
