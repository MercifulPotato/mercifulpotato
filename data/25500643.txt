Regular languages are really neat! They have an air of being an &quot;important&quot; mathematical object, given how many different &quot;natural&quot; characterizations of them exist.<p>In a standard CS course you&#x27;ll start out learning that regular expressions and finite state automata define the same class of languages. But they&#x27;re also equivalent to:<p>- Languages generated by regular grammars (only rules of the form A -&gt; a, A -&gt; Ba, or A -&gt; epsilon)<p>- Languages definable in monadic second-order (MSO) logic<p>- Languages &quot;recognized&quot; by a finite monoid (this algebraic appraoch to formal languages is super interesting and rich!)<p>- Language&#x27;s whose Myhill-Nerode relation has finitely many equivalence classes')
