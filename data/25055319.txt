As for why it started with Trump, there could be a few reasons, all speculation on my part: He may be attracting people who didn&#x27;t vote much before, and these new voters are the sorts of people who have lower trust etc., and so don&#x27;t answer polls. Personally though, I think it <i>might</i> be more that President Trump&#x27;s messaging fosters &amp; encourages a certain amount of distrust: Fake News, anything negative about him are lies, deep state conspiracies, other views aren&#x27;t just disagreements but bad&#x2F;treason&#x2F;sedition, etc. If distrustful people don&#x27;t answer polls, and President Trump has made his followers more distrustful, then his followers are now less likely to answer polls. Just a hypothesis though.')
