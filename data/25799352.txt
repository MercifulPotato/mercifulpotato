That&#x27;s precisely what I mentioned was the only barrier in achieving it. The answer to getting it done is getting alignment from various stakeholders.<p>Many of the people that think it&#x27;s a hoax or the ones that don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s doomsday support nuclear plants. That&#x27;s always been the case in the US.<p>You can get alignment without even agreeing on <i>why</i> to go nuclear. This escapes the doomsdayers and the climate crusaders. And based on your comment... you.<p>I mean - you provided a perfect example. You mentioned our outgoing President thinking climate change is a hoax while we are talking about nuclear plants. And he supported nuclear plants.<p>People with different concerns and end goals can&#x27;t talk and agree on things that would help both of their agendas.<p>You want nuclear plants? Pitch national security to one group. Pitch saving the world to the other. Pitch cleaner air to another.<p>You aren&#x27;t going to get anything done if you try to convince them that they need to believe your reason.<p>As Neil deGrasse Tyson&#x27;s dad told him - it&#x27;s not enough to be right. You must be effective.')
