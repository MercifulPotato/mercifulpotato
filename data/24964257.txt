Most infected people spread to nobody, even without restrictions. The bulk of spread happens in clusters in poorly ventilated indoor environments. The household attack rate is something like 17%. That’s people living in the same house. 83% of people don’t get it!<p>To have a sustained outbreak breach quarantine, you’d need:<p>1. An infected person to arrive (probably less than 2% of arrivals are infected)<p>2. This infected person must breach isolation protocol. (Most people are honest or fear or penalties)<p>3. They must be infectious when they breach protocol (you are only very infectious for five days or so)<p>4. They must go to a place apt to superspreading (not everyone breaching isolation will go to a bar or a party)<p>5. The newly infected must all remain asymptomatic and not seek testing<p>6. Once community spread is detected, the government must delay taking action, fail to contact trace, and avoid implementing new measures<p>This is obviously possible. Outbreaks <i>have</i> happened in Australia, Vietnam, New Zealand, New Brunswick. But it is much, much less likely than you suggest, which is why you’re being downvoted: you’re completely failing to consider the system dynamics.<p>And in each case step 6 has put things back on track pretty quick. Australia is the exception, but there the local government was slow to respond and so they needed a big, long lockdown. Other areas responded quickly and so the necessary lockdown has been short.<p>I’m in the Atlantic bubble. Frankly it leaks like a sieve and yet it’s still been enough to keep out infections for now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic&#x2F;616548&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;k-overloo...</a>')
