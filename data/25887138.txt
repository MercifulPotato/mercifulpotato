Also, there are other important concerns! If you don&#x27;t trust how a US company is going to handle your data --- <i>cough</i> Facebook --- you shouldn&#x27;t use them, no matter what you think NSA is going to do.<p>But: the protections I&#x27;m talking about aren&#x27;t rights accorded to non-US persons abroad. I agree, you have very few legal protections against the US as a non-US person in (say) Europe. But the US company itself does have protections. It is not lawful for NSA (or the DOJ or CIA or whatever) to hack into Google&#x27;s servers; on the flip side, it is probably lawful for NSA to have pre-hacked every major information provider and telecom in Europe, if they really wanted to. My point is, if you&#x27;re overseas, the largest SIGINT agency in the world doesn&#x27;t even have to ask to get access.<p>(Obviously, they don&#x27;t have to ask in the US if they simply ignore the law, but then, if you ignore the law, none of this matters, and everything is up for grabs).')
