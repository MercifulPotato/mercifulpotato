Item(by='WClayFerguson', descendants=None, kids=[25885765, 25885172, 25884674], score=None, time=1611422349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882778, text='&gt; There is really nothing quantum in this<p>Even if you consider a Hydrogen atom floating in free space a billion miles from any planets, <i>everything</i> about it is 100% &quot;quantum&quot;.<p>There are no actual electrons going around the nucleus, because it&#x27;s purely just a quantum probability wave. If you then introduce Oxygen atoms near it, then the probability wave of the two begin to behave as a <i>single</i> system and will oscillate in a <i>different</i> pattern but STILL a single quantum mechanical system, and one big &quot;wave function&quot; that represents the entire system.<p>In this multi-atom system you also cannot even say that one specific electron is going around one atom, and another electron is going around a different electron (the incorrect classical view). The electron probability wave for the entire system is one big probability wave oscillator function, and both electrons contribute to magnitudes of observables in an identical way to each other. So the two electrons loose their individual identity. They&#x27;re both part of a &#x27;cloud&#x27; but you can&#x27;t say where any of them are. Not because it&#x27;s hard to measure, but because actually <i>reality itself</i> doesn&#x27;t even know.<p>None of this is inconsistent with the fact that the classical view also holds true under ordinary observational conditions, and can be <i>estimated</i> (albeit incorrectly) as pre-existing atoms &quot;snapping together&quot; by the laws of chemistry, but that is the less &#x27;complete&#x27; view. Just like Newton is a less complete view than Relativity, but still &#x27;works&#x27;.')
