Item(by='horsawlarway', descendants=None, kids=[25127557, 25126750], score=None, time=1605626594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124384, text='I think you&#x27;re twisting the problem statement a little here.<p>Asking &quot;How do I unsend an email&quot; is just as unreasonable as asking &quot;Hey, give me that gift I gave you back&quot;.<p>The problem is that, regardless of your intent, you&#x27;ve given something to someone and they own it now.<p>You can&#x27;t undo that without involving the 3rd party (Or breaking the law and stealing it, digitally for the email).<p>And I want to be clear upfront - THIS IS A GOOD THING.<p>I don&#x27;t want Amazon to be able to &quot;unsend&quot; my receipts.  I don&#x27;t want Google to be able to &quot;unsend&quot; my support chat log.  I don&#x27;t want my boss to be able to &quot;unsend&quot; his approval for my time off.<p>This system is designed explicitly to put the <i>USER</i> first.  But it treats each side of the exchange as user, and values them equally - If they disagree, it&#x27;s not the system&#x27;s job to resolve that, they have to talk it out.<p>Slack and Messenger (and a lot of other modern chat) have an arbiter - They don&#x27;t require users to agree because they own the content, not the users.  In a company slack, I haven&#x27;t given you anything when I message you.  I&#x27;ve just pinned something to the company message board.  I can take it down, and so can anyone else who has the key.  It&#x27;s not mine and it&#x27;s not yours - It is very clearly owned by the company.<p>That can work great in a well structured environment, but I have to laugh when you say its replacing email. It&#x27;s not a replacement, it&#x27;s a complement - They are not the same things.<p>Just like an oral promise with no witnesses is NOT the same as a signed receipt.  Use each as needed.')
