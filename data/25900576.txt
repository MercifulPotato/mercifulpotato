No rolling shutter, very low delay, continuous signal processing instead of per-frame, maximum resolution around ~70MP eq. in the center, f&#x2F;2.8 aperture at a full-frame image size, servo driven active rangefinding, continuous cleaning, etc...<p>A camera with those features would be around 3000-15000$, and you&#x27;d need two.<p>Also, the human brain can use focus information and stereo phase to deduce 3D structure, which is another ace up its sleeve.<p>It might very well be the case that reproducing this is more expensive in training, processing and material than LiDAR. In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very likely - we&#x27;re talking loops that need to update hundreds of times a second and data rates in the gigabits, which our brains deal with by doing a lot of processing inside the eye and along the way.')
