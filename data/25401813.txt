Bible codes just look for a short sequence of meaning hidden in chaos, ie a few 5 letter word patterns hidden in 1000 pages of gibberish, which are almost guaranteed to exist in any large body of text. In contrast this solution requires the whole message to make sense, which is much more entropy.')
