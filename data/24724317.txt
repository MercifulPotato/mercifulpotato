Include a picture, illustration or a bit of creative text and copyright will apply on that. That&#x27;s the true reason why cookbooks fall under copyright (while the actual list of ingredients and instructions do not, which people do lift out of cookbooks for example).<p>Even when applying copyright to an &quot;arrangement&quot; of items that are not copyrightable, as in a database, there needs to be creativity expressed, otherwise it will not qualify for copyright.')
