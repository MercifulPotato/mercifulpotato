The sooner people realise this, the sooner people will stop using Facebook - which in my opinion is a good thing.<p>The SWP could instead have their own website (which they do) and the ability to subscribe to their newsletters via email (they may have this already). \nFurther to this they could setup their own forum on their own website, again they may already have this).
