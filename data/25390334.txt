I pull something off the shelf, antlr for my latest project, then get on with it.<p>The parser is the most trivial side of things, if you consider that a key skill it comes across as being an issue from the 1970s, not today. Writing a RD by hand is not a big deal anyway as someone else said.<p>If your into optimising compilers you&#x27;re focusing on a very odd area to criticise. I&#x27;d gave though more about dataflow using lattices or whatever, graph stuff etc.<p>So parsing aside, what are the &#x27;relevant&#x27; skills you feel are missing?<p>(and what are &#x27;Database Compilers&#x27;? Nearest I can think of that may fit are query optimisers)')
