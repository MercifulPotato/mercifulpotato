Unfortunately, it seems like various restaurants and stores have simply started to distribute &quot;non-single use&quot; versions of the takeout containers and plastic bags which are more robust (ie. use more material), however, its likely these simply get discarded anyways which makes the problem worse. Other than the round &quot;deli&quot; containers which are great and I actually re-use. Only a few restaurants have switched to glass canning jars which can be reused easily, given away or recycled.')
