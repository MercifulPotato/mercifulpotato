It started out as a gimmick but with DLSS 2.0 it&#x27;s just 70%+ free performance improvement with the only downside being somewhat limited game support.<p>Watch Dogs Legion comes out tomorrow and I&#x27;ve been benchmarking it today, as have many others in the subreddit. DLSS is sometimes improving things but is also quite often leading to worse performance, especially if RTX is set to ultra. I have no idea if the issue is game specific or not but I&#x27;d be curious to know which games use it well.')
