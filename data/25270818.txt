Gitlab and GitHub don’t have real time chat, that would be a start. Then on top of that, to have context driven chat (a chat that is about a merge request, a branch). Or in Jira, to seamlessly chat on a ticket with those involved. That stuff doesn’t exist yet. We have the primitive version of context-less chat which is great for context-less conversation (normal social interaction). In business, we have something very specific to talk about so would like to see a new idea in this space.<p>The place where this does seem to be evolving is in customer support. When you chat with a representative, they have a lot of context. Your account, order, possible issue, etc.')
