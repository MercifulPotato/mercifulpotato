There are lots of apartments in Norway without a garage, yet overnight charging has been implemented in every kind of parking arrangement by now.<p>In Oslo, where a lot of parking is handled by the municipality, they&#x27;ve put up charging poles and charge a small fee for the electricity. That&#x27;s about the hardest case, it&#x27;s a PITA to dig up the street in a dense city to install these things.<p>My friend lives in an apartment complex with outdoor parking, where the parking is managed by the HOA. Owners&#x2F;renters can pay to have a small charging outlet installed at their parking spot. Funny thing is these parking spots already had outlets for engine heaters (it can be hard to start ICE cars in winter), but I&#x27;m pretty sure they had to lay new wire for charging since the current can be higher. Same deal with our home. It&#x27;s a garage, but managed by the HOA. They decided to renovate the fuse box and electric wiring to facility installing chargers, since wiring was old and needed to be renovated anyway. Owners pay for the charging box and installation. There&#x27;s a small load balancer that insures that the chargers don&#x27;t overload the main power supply to the garage.<p>It&#x27;s a challenge, sure. But faaar from impossible. I get that the US has a problem with doing shared infrastructure in general. But I think this will solve itself once there&#x27;s enough money to be made. Similar to how internet&#x2F;cable is rolled out. Companies will offer the owners of the apartment complex to install the chargers for free, in exchange for charging a fee on the electricity sold to people charging with them.')
