One is a 4k display, and the other a normal display. Display scaling works fine - but once enabled I get a weird bug where I can see a duplicate, frozen mouse cursor on my screen based on where the mouse was in the login prompt. And it hovers on top of all other windows. Somehow the mouse cursor bug is related to the HiDPI scaling options.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to just use the downstairs toilet. I move the mouse to the bottom right corner of the screen before I log in.')
