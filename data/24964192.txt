And, yet, here you are deliberately misreading my original comment in bad faith, and all but saying &quot;scary genocidal mustache man bad.&quot;<p>You just invoked some historical facts in a way that suggests a connection without explaining the connection. Thats what was lazy. On my end it has nothing to do with moustaches. Thats just your preferred reading.')
