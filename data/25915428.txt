Only a fraction of them break, and especially with electronics never versions are strictly better than older versions. Most people buy newer iPhone because their old ones have become too slow, not because they are broken.<p>And I think you are wrong about the economics of repairing vs recycling.<p>In both cases, it also depends on the market demand.<p>If people want to repair their stuff so much, why don&#x27;t any companies come forward with repairable products? Some do (Fairphone, I guess), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a huge success.<p>In any case, anybody who really wanted to could see to buying only repairable things. What is the point in offering people who don&#x27;t want to to do the same?<p>I think people just want the same iPhone they have now, with additional &quot;repairale&quot; property. That is not going to happen. The repairable iPhone will be thicker and less elegant than the non-repairable iPhone (compare iPhone to Fiarphone). And suddenly people are not buying it anymore.')
