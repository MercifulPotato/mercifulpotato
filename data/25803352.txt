I learned modern SPA development with Mithril and in many ways still prefer it over React or Svelte.<p>It&#x27;s definitely starting to show its age as many of the main contributors have moved on and new libs are being created everyday. However the chat [1] is still very active and there are always great discussions going on there that are often not even specifically about Mithril. One of the best dev communities I&#x27;ve found, honestly.<p>One major benefit of Mithril for me is the lack of need for polyfills while still including a router, XHR utils, and simple state management, AND being compatible with IE11 out of the box, which is invaluable for many government contracts I work on where I don&#x27;t want to introduce any potentially complicated build tools to an already complex codebase.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;mithriljs&#x2F;mithril.js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;mithriljs&#x2F;mithril.js</a>')
