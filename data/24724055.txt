Let&#x27;s just ban political debate everywhere. It&#x27;s so divisive! At maximum, you should debate causes or political candidates with people who think exactly like you. But even this may lead to unexpected frustration, it&#x27;s much better to just rest assured that everybody thinks exactly like you.')
