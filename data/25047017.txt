There&#x27;s a LOT of distraction in an IDE, and it does a lot of magic behind the scenes that you need to be aware of, because sometimes it does something unexpected and you have to be able to tell it not to.  If you&#x27;re learning something, you need to be able to focus on the piece that you&#x27;re learning, master it, and then expand from there - that&#x27;s how everything is taught, for good reason.')
