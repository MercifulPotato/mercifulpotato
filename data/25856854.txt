As far as I can tell Oracle has burned a lot of people because they don&#x27;t do license checks in their software (no DRM of any kind), which is <i>usually</i> what the HN crowd wants. But the flip side is they have to check you in some other way, leading to audits, and audits are very painful.<p>Is the difference that RHEL does subscription checks so they don&#x27;t need to audit customers so much?<p>In terms of open source contributions, RH certainly do more, but Oracle are no slouch. They&#x27;re doing actually exciting stuff with GraalVM and I don&#x27;t really remember the last time I saw Red Hat do anything describable as research, their Java stewardship has been pretty responsible, they publish quite a lot of useful tools and stuff.')
