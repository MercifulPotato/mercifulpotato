I&#x27;d rather a cop be hurt unfairly in the line of duty than a protester fighting for what he believes in.  This country was founded on overthrowing tyrrany.  If the cops don&#x27;t accept the risks of the job then they can quit.  Cops need to be held to a higher standard, not lower or even equal.  The government (and police) should fear the people, not the other way around.<p>So no.  It is that clean.')
