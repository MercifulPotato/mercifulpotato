It seems like the best application of blockchain is as a semi-decentralized, semi-anonymous token for transferring value.<p>But it&#x27;s not even really good at that. It&#x27;s not liquid, it&#x27;s prone to bugs and attacks, and it doesn&#x27;t even seem to be that anonymous.<p>So I&#x27;d personally argue it was designed to be a solution to one thing, and it does not do that well.<p>&gt; <i>Scammers seized the oportunity to market blockchain as a solution to all your problems to profit themselves and a lot of people were fooled.</i><p>So anyone who advocates blockchain for something other than cryptocurrency is a scammer?<p>That seems a little farfetched. There are plenty of &quot;true believers&quot; who have completely bought into the blockchain-for-everything nonsense, and they&#x27;re now using &quot;DeFi&quot; to rebrand because blockchain has become such an embarrassing buzzword.')
