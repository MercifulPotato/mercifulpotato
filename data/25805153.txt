They specifically want to label companies like Google as &quot;gatekeepers&quot; in The Digital Markets Act.<p>From: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinsentmasons.com&#x2F;out-law&#x2F;news&#x2F;gatekeepers-face-eu-digital-markets-act-regulation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pinsentmasons.com&#x2F;out-law&#x2F;news&#x2F;gatekeepers-face-...</a><p>&gt; In case of violations, the new law would provide for fines of up to 10% of a gatekeeper&#x27;s total global turnover. Lasseur said: &quot;The fines are high, but they correspond to the usual sanction regime for violations of European competition law.&quot;<p>&gt; In the event of a repeated offence, following a detailed market investigation by the Commission, the company could even be broken if the Commission finds that there is no effective alternative to ensure that the gatekeeper obligations are complied with.<p>The fines will no longer be just a cost of doing business, but an existential threat. It may take 10 or 15 years in courts but EU will break down likes of Google for repeated offenses even if the relevant products will no longer exist.')
