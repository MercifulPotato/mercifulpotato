(In fact they will generally fall in the areas where productivity is increasing, <i>if</i> the money supply is not being messed with.)<p><i>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t it also be true that as certain goods deflate in price, labor force participation should go up as well since the same wage allows you to buy more stuff?</i><p>There will probably be more people willing to work, yes. Whether that translates into more actual jobs will depend a lot on how easy it is to start new businesses, since that&#x27;s where the new jobs will have to come from. Our current regulatory regime makes it much more difficult than it should be to start new businesses.<p><i>&gt; wealth isn&#x27;t the money you have, it&#x27;s what you can buy. Today most people, even those at the bottom, have access to many things today than even John D. Rockefeller didn&#x27;t have access to when he was alive.</i><p>This is a very good point, which I wish more people would recognize.')
