One benefit of being more popular is that they get more contributions, but given that they barely get enough contributions to fix macOS-specific bugs as it is, it&#x27;s not clear that the benefit outweighs the costs.<p>Apple and Apple users respond to tangible consequences; appeasement doesn&#x27;t seem to be working, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be benefiting the project either. Like OP said, it&#x27;s magnanimous of the developer to do this but I don&#x27;t think &quot;users demand it&quot; is a great justification, nor is it quite in the spirit of open source.')
