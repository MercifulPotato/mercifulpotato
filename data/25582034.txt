You know &gt;51% of them are likely bad ideas (or at least it would be a bad idea to adopt most of them simultaneously). How can you tell which are worth adopting? If you trusted any of the suggesters <i>absolutely</i> they probably would&#x27;ve been promoted already, so it&#x27;s difficult; you &quot;stubbornly&quot; reject most of them (probably some of the good ones too), or at the very least put them on the long finger for consideration later.<p>When you do get on board with an idea, yes there is still the problem of proper attribution and credit, and often there&#x27;s non-benign human factors involved in muddying the waters there. But often ideas are Venn diagrams and defining them as atomic things from a single source isn&#x27;t really practical.')
