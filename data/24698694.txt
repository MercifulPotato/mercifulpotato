They aren&#x27;t publicizing this fact, but it happens more than one would think, a <i>lot</i> of tech companies are told by investors not to share their secret sauce.<p>I&#x27;ve done 50+ diligences in the last two years, ranging from $2M to $1.5B transactions. Only two had embedded DSLs, one in lisp and one in their own language that wrote an interpreter for in C. I don&#x27;t think Python gets embedded much these days to be honest, I&#x27;ve done it and the experience was not pleasant compared to using S7. Though I do  know Lua gets used in the game industry.')
