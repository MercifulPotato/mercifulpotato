Especially given the emergency this virus has created, I can&#x27;t help but wonder how life would have been different if the trials were open to anyone who wanted one.<p>&quot;This vaccine probably works. We won&#x27;t know for sure until December. If you want to try it anyway, come get one. Otherwise, we&#x27;ll let you know when the trials are completed.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s heartbreaking to think about all of the irreplaceable experiences people missed this year, especially for those who didn&#x27;t live to see the end of this pandemic.  Of course I&#x27;m glad for all the people who didn&#x27;t catch the virus, but the costs are too infrequently considered. Our regulatory bureaucracy was insanely expensive this year in terms of our most valuable resource: quality time. Nobody even questions it; we just accept that this is how it&#x27;s supposed to work, because it&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve ever experienced.')
