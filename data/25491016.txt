Sorensen Video 3 was based on the h.264 draft.<p>It&#x27;s interesting because h.263 (coming out of the ITU-T) was developed for video conferencing like h.261. Real and Sorensen adapted it to streaming&#x2F;disc delivery. The MPEG-4 spec was the first time the VCEG and MPEG got together and put the peanut butter and chocolate together from the start. It&#x27;s maybe obvious in hindsight but I think it was the first time the needs of video conferencing, streaming, and disc&#x2F;&quot;digital&quot; delivery really overlapped in terms of devices and environment.')
