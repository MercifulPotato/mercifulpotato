I have a very old Intel i5 (2500k) and a Nvidia GTX 970 (I think) and I have a very solid gaming experience with Steam Play on it.<p>Pop!_OS is Ubuntu based but with Flatpak instead of Snap and without the Ubuntu calling home stuff. Meaning it is great for development. Last time I tried developing on Windows I remember being very frustrated. Now I don&#x27;t have Windows installed on anything and I am happier for it.')
