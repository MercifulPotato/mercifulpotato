I can easily appreciate how people disrespect Trump, but I cannot appreciate when those same people respect the general state of politics in the US.</i><p>That&#x27;s my general impression of the entire system too, but I still think Trump represents a radical departure from even that. The status quo serving entrenched bureaucracy (&quot;deep state&quot;) had at least been performing basic non-partisan functions such as pandemic response. Disrupting that with no replacement waiting is a short path to a completely failed state.<p>If I were the type of libertarian that thought moving to the middle of nowhere represented the pinnacle of freedom, the thought might appeal to be. But IMO the true measure of freedom is how it scales with society, and collapses have a terrible track record for freedom.')
