Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605814353, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25149342, text='It does, and some of the later Halos had more accurate weapons (I recall a 3 or 4 shot burst rifle being the new starting weapon?).<p>The pistol actually seemed popular among players with better accuracy than myself, specifically because it was one of the few weapons accurate enough to reliably land headshots.<p>I tried some of the later Halo games, and it felt very non-Halo, and I think this pins it down.  In the original Halo, it was relatively difficult to die instantly.  Grenades, sniper rifles, the bazooka, and the hand sword were the only weapons that could do it, and each of them had substantial tradeoffs (grenades were limited, the bazooka traveled rather slowly and only killed on direct hits or very close hits, etc).  Now there are tons of weapons that can kill in one hit.  I think the starting rifle can&#x27;t one shot, but two bursts to the head is death.  And they&#x27;ve turned up the aim assist to the point where players are fairly good at getting headshots.<p>It misses all those &quot;if I hide behind this rock and let my shields regen, I might survive&quot; moments.  There&#x27;s no tension to the game as you struggle to survive; in a flash you&#x27;re either the conqueror or the conquered.  There&#x27;s no cat and mouse as you chase someone through their base, hoping they don&#x27;t hide behind a corner and stick you with a plasma grenade.<p>Maybe the tension is what I miss more than the slower speed of play.  After all, fast playing games can still be fun (like Sonic) because they keep that tension that you could die at any second.  That kind of tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat, so when you finally make it through you get the level you lean back and pat yourself on the shoulder.  Modern AAA games seem to want to get directly to the dopamine hit, so they crushed the combat sequence into a very small number of actions so that you can do it over and over again faster.  It just doesn&#x27;t do as much for me.')
