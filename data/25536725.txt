I&#x27;d expect them to spend time on more higher-level things, but seems here they either was involved with actually writing the driver, and&#x2F;or are just the public face for the patch. Seems unusual though. Kudos if directors at Sony still get to write code, especially low-level code like this.<p>Edit: Seems there is more details in a almost year old article on phoronix (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Sony-HID-Official-But-Clones" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Sony-HID...</a>):<p>&gt; Roderick Colenbrander of Sony who serves as their Directory of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering, chimed in on the matter of adding this Gasia controller support (And, yes, this is the same Roderick Colenbrander who in his spare time serves as a Wine developer and if going back to the early 2000&#x27;s was the NVClock NVIDIA overclocking tool developer as opposed to being some eager Sony employee):<p>So seems Roderick is a true hacker! I&#x27;ve used both Wine and NVClock in the past so if you&#x27;re around here, thanks for your work on all these things and upstreaming them as well! :)')
