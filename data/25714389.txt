I think there&#x27;s pressure within the scientific community to come up with concrete and tangible threats linked to global warming.<p>Otherwise all you have is stuff like &quot;global temperatures are going to rise by n degrees over the course of the century&quot; with n being a relatively low number for us humans used to <i>local</i> weather having much greater temperature swings. Sure, if we&#x27;re educated we can understand why this is a huge problem, but for people who don&#x27;t want to hear this (and may benefit in the short term from not hearing it) &quot;the weather is going to be 5 degrees hotter in a century&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound all that bad.<p>So in order to cut through some scientists look for more dramatic events that <i>could</i> come as a consequence of this. The problem of course is that the climate is wild and hard to predict over large timescales and sometimes they&#x27;re wrong, and then the climate change deniers use that as evidence that they&#x27;re lying.')
