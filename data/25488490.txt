I am French and replaced the ISP (Orange) provided router (which is a piece of crap) with my own router.<p>The reverse engineering needed to get access is huge. There are people who managed to match the credentials with the DHCP request to be sent but Orange can change this anytime.<p>Other providers (Bouygues for instance) are easier as they do not try to do that.<p>What surprises me is that they have maybe 0.001% of their subscribers who will even think about replacing the box (and dealing withe the issues as this is not supported) so I tend to think that the ISP is just dumb rather than malicious.')
