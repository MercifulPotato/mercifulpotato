If one look at the news nearly all the victims are women and all the perpetrators menn. Earlier this was somewhat balanced that most of the success people on tv was men but these days there is gender parity or more women in these positions as experts&#x2F;politicians. \nMore single parent homes which in most cases means children living with their mother, means fewer male role models especially when in kindergarten and primary school is mostly women. This also affect the other children since the framing of the world is more &quot;feminist&quot; and children try to fit in as well as possible with other children.')
