Endless growth and short term profit are two hallmarks of capitalism. They also lead to exploiting natural resources past the point of no return.<p>I think there’s definitely potential for harmful growth + short term thinking in socialist countries as well, especially when you factor in international competition.<p>But I think it could only be better than what we’re doing now.<p>Imo the biggest differentiator between a more capitalist society and a more democratic socialist society is who has power. In the US, it’s people and corporations with lots of money. And guess what! People and corporations with lots of money are incentivized to accelerate climate disaster if it means boosting their short term wealth.<p>In (ideal — I know it’s not going to work out 100% this way) democratic socialism, everyone has equal power. This will necessarily lead to a less exploitative relationship to our planet.<p>You can see an example of capitalist vs demsoc power dynamics in the green new deal. A majority of registered voters across parties support the GND [1]. So in a demsoc society with the same level of support, the GND would be made into law. But there’s a slim chance it’ll come to fruition in the US. Why? Because the people in power have a vested interest in not losing money, and any worthwhile GND is going to cost the rich a _lot_ of money.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;energy-environment&#x2F;421765-poll-majorities-of-both-parties-support-green-new-deal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;energy-environment&#x2F;421765-poll-ma...</a>')
