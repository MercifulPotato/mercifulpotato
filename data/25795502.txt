Elasticsearch (as an open source product) is not independent. Its reliant on Elastic co, who have a demonstrated history of reducing its FOSS-stance in favor of making more money. Of course, they had to do this; Amazon forced them into a corner, similar to MongoDB. But the fact that there <i>is</i> a critical company behind these two databases, who <i>can</i> be strong-armed, is a threat to the ecosystem these two databases have developed.<p>Compare to Postgres. Postgres will never die. Aurora is gaining serious traction; do you think the Postgres developers are concerned? Why would they be? Their livelihood, and their ability to develop Postgres, does not depend on it being the #1 database in the world.<p>Naturally, ODfES has a tether to Amazon. Amazon could decide to lock more features behind AWS ESS. Its not a perfect situation, but it is better than the one ES has been in for the past few years.')
