The primary mistake most people make with MMT (and one which is continually enforced by both sides of the political media), is that they think it is a policy choice, or a &quot;kind of thing a government does&quot;.<p>If nothing else, please takeaway that MMT is a _framework for economic analysis_. You can apply it to any economy, you can use it to look at any policy decision, and you can work with this tool if you&#x27;re a conservative or progressive. I find a lot of value in using it to understand China, Japan, emerging markets, economic history, etc.<p>With relation to the original topic, the answer through an MMT lens is very simple. Nominally, there&#x27;s no limit.<p>A cornerstone idea of MMT is that a currency issuer can <i>always</i> purchase anything for sale in the currency that it has a monopoly over. Examples of these monetary sovereigns include the US, the UK, Japan, Australia, China. It does not include the EU, or most emerging markets (who effectively use another government&#x27;s currency).<p>The implication of this is that a monetary sovereign government has no binding constraints on the amount of debt it can issue (it can of course issue debt to itself if no-one else is around to buy it, i.e. Treasury -&gt; Central Bank).<p>Now that&#x27;s not to say that government borrowing has <i>no real limits</i>. The most useful constraints to look at are real resource constraints (possible supply of goods and services), and external constraints (do you need to pay something in a currency you can&#x27;t control?). If the government is purchasing more goods or services than the resource constraints are available to supply, you&#x27;ll see an appreciation of prices (inflation).<p>Simply creating more dollars doesn&#x27;t lead to inflation. Fiat currencies are just units of account (think score points), not some kind of commodity. Japan&#x27;s money supply has quintupled since 1990 to 2020 (from memory), while the consumer price index has been roughly flat, and the USD&#x2F;JPY exchange rate has been roughly rangebound (wide range, but not a monotonic increase like one would expect if using intuition )<p>Rushed for time, but happy to discuss&#x2F;debate points of contention.')
