Unless you&#x27;re keen to run the business yourself, there isn&#x27;t much point in fighting this beyond getting your 1st year vesting.<p>It&#x27;s honestly not worth your time and energy fighting for something you&#x27;re not keen to do. And it&#x27;s definitely cheaper for them to give you 7% more than the 3% offered, and avoid all this hassle and potential legal expense.<p>If you do want to persist, then you need the investor on your side, as otherwise you can&#x27;t force the other person out (they&#x27;d still keep their 10% but that&#x27;s the price you pay for that move).<p>I have to say I find it really odd that someone who&#x27;s invested $100k is being silent on this, or isn&#x27;t worried about this situation, especially if the future of the business is now more of a lifestyle business. I fail to see how they&#x27;d get a return they&#x27;d expect. I&#x27;d assume they&#x27;re actually on the other side, but want to appear neutral.<p>FWIW if you end up leaving, I&#x27;d advise not agreeing to a non-compete or a non-disclosure. It&#x27;s not about you starting a competitor, but more about them not being able to restrict your future options as they&#x27;re forcing you out, and they will have to potentially consider the threat of you competing with them at any point in the future.<p>It&#x27;s a credit to your efforts that you&#x27;ve built the tech of business that&#x27;s gotten such good traction and numbers, so you&#x27;ve got learnings and experience that will serve you in good stead in the future.<p>It&#x27;s just unfortunate that you ended up with such shitty partners.<p>Good luck, and I assume quite a few of us will be hoping you bounce back from this, and rooting for you.')
