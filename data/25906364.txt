Then as far as I understand, they are able to take signatures which contain no discernable audio data and use those to discover new audio trends.<p>&gt; On Pixel 4 and later phones, the counts of songs recognized are aggregated using a privacy-preserving technology called federated analytics. This will be used to improve Now Playing&#x27;s song database so it will recognize whatâ€™s playing more often. Google can never see what songs you listen to, just the most popular songs in different regions.<p>Privacy-preserving, user-beneficial, and useful for advertising targeting if you haven&#x27;t opted out of interest based ads.')
