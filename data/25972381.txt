I on the other hand abhor slavery.<p>You have to believe that being a free person anywhere else than US is worse than being a slave in US for this to make sense. And I&#x27;m not a slave, and not in US, and I would much rather be anywhere else than in US, so not sure what I&#x27;m missing.<p>&gt; a vastly improved life and future for your children<p>In USA? A white supremacist and systemically racist hellhole where cops hunt people of color like dogs on the street and put the ones they don&#x27;t kill into private slave prisons? How is it better than just not having that?<p>I would not even visit USA if someone paid me, and I feel sorry for the people who have to live there every day of their lives and if I had more means I would do more to help the people who live in the US find other options. Surely it is some crime against humanity to make people live in a place like that.')
