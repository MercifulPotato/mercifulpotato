This will set the &quot;tone&quot; and the base number for negotiation. Your mind will be thinking &quot;he said 110, so I guess they might go to 120&quot; so you&#x27;ll maybe ask for 130 and accept the 120 they offer you next.<p>Queue up yourself asking for 150 coz you make 100 right now and you did your research. The recruiter might just begrudgingly give you the 150 they were prepared to go to anyway coz you seem to know your stuff. Of maybe he&#x27;s gonna haggle you down to 140. Big deal. But you set the tone of the conversation. This is not gonna work if you don&#x27;t know your worth but either way either you are gonna lowball yourself and they will just accept or they are gonna lowball it.<p>Episode 10 here but the rest are awesome too:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;negotiation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;negotiation</a>')
