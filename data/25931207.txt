I didn&#x27;t want to turn my quick comment into an off-the-cuff analysis of the actual complexity behind &quot;billionaires should give away their money.&quot; :) I know in practice that&#x27;s easier said than done, although I also know that in practice it&#x27;s still doable. MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos&#x27;s ex-wife, provides a reasonable example here. (There are also probably a thousand think pieces one could write about just what it &quot;means&quot; that she is, apparently, the richest woman on earth almost entirely because she divorced the second-richest man on earth.)<p>I will <i>slightly</i> disagree with characterizing Musk&#x27;s linked tweet as &quot;doing what you&#x27;re asking the money for&quot;, only because &quot;intended&quot; is a bit nebulous; he could be spending a lot of money solving problems <i>now</i> rather than merely &quot;intending&quot; to do so. (One could argue that his companies are all intended to solve problems, to be sure, but that gets way more nebulous really fast.)')
