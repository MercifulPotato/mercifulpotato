Then again, Java has been called &quot;the next COBOL&quot;, so that&#x27;s an interesting comparison.<p>&gt; <i>Even if you&#x27;re passionate about something, job stability and good pay are going to be the primary drivers in decisions about jobs.</i><p>For a lot of people, yes. Not for all. And even then, it&#x27;s hard to argue that COBOL is cool or interesting. It&#x27;s just paying the bills, but nothing to get hyped or write gushing articles about. And there are more interesting programming jobs that will also pay the bills, anyway.')
