Item(by='iguy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602705078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24778379, text='&gt; the difference between Dutch windmills and English waterwheels was a wash (no pun intended) at the critical early part of the First Industrial Revolution<p>Would be interesting to see numbers on this. I would have guessed there was substantially more total power from water in England (just before steam) than the wind in NL, but could be wrong. It may depend a lot on what year you pick for the comparison. And whether you include all the isolated windmills pumping water to keep farmland dry, or only the ones doing work that was also done by water-mills.<p>Coal and steam weren&#x27;t the first chapter, but are hard to overestimate once they did arrive, IMO.')
