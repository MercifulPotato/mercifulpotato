If this is from an address range you own, you can filter and drop packets at ingress&#x2F;egress from the customer address space in case somehow traffic is misproperly routed (not via the WG tunnel). As new containers go on and offline, you can distribute this state through the system, and if a user reaches out to an IP that you don&#x27;t know whether or not it&#x27;s assigned, you can consult an oracle as to the location.')
