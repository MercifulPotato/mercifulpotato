I admit to being a fan of Google&#x27;s old engineering first style - spending a minimum on advertising, lobbying, and maintaining an open and loose organization (which they&#x27;ve had to reverse this is last few years of course).<p>And  so it follows that I dislike Oracle for how they compete and how they come off in this article.  Maybe others react differently to it?')
