It&#x27;s a statement of faith, not something that has a solid theoretical basis.<p>Any form of FTL causes problems with causality - or at least with current assumptions about causality. So physicists tend to work back from that to &quot;Therefore this is impossible.&quot;<p>But those assumptions may turn out to be wrong and relativity may be violated in specific quantum contexts. And then all kinds of interesting things happen.<p>Incidentally, this is an example of the kind of thing Hossenfelder was talking about. You could spend $20bn on a new collider, or you can spend a couple of million - at the absolute most - to check there&#x27;s nothing unexpected happening here.<p>It&#x27;s a wild bet, but given the up side it&#x27;s hard to characterise it as poor value.<p>At worst you&#x27;ll get some insight into the interface between QM and relativity, with another situation where Relativity Wins Again - but you understand why, in detail.<p>At best you&#x27;ll get something more challenging and interesting.')
