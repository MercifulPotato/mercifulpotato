It makes logical sense—how can half of the <i>entire population</i> be mostly wrong, and the rest mostly right?<p>But then I always remember that in the United States, there is only one major political party that believes Climate Change is real. The other party believes the phenomenon is some sort of gigantic ruse.<p>I consider Climate Change the most pressing issue of our time, and myself a single-issue voter. Not because everything else is unimportant, but because Climate Change is <i>even more</i> important. We <i>have</i> to get this right, and we <i>have</i> to start immediately!<p>If the two parties disagreed on how to <i>address</i> Climate Change—say, with a carbon tax versus renewable energy subsidies—that would be one thing. But that&#x27;s not the world we live in. As long as one of the parties insists that Climate Change is a complete fabrication, I don&#x27;t see how I can possibly take anything they say seriously.')
