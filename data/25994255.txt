Generally speaking, my organization doesn&#x27;t maintain large document repositories because they go stale quickly and our products are too vast to document in such a way.<p>For some context on my reply:<p>- We maintain one design document per project. This document references everything from the application specifications to the automation that puts it in production.<p>- Most documentation is written in line with code.
