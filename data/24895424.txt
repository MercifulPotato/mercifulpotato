Formulated as a trade-off: When I have to choose, I prefer richness of IDE (and other tooling) automation to program creation automation that I write myself (i.e. meta programming).<p>This trade-off is not restricted to Lisp, but also applies to e.g. C++ template meta programming. Compilers have gotten betters with templates, but still debugging the more advanced usages of templates can become hellish. Codifying the features the meta programming supplies in the language itself or in well supported libraries means that error messages get better and many usage scenarios are documented on Stackoverflow.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt your experience regarding Clojure vs JavaScript code bases, but this probably has to do with other reasons than the meta programming the original blog post is about?')
