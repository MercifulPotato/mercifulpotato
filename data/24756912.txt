I was mistaken because I saw a big police show and tell at an abandoned parking lot late last year, and saw multiples. The city next door has 2, and all the adjacent cities also have their own. Keep in mind these these cities are all basically considered the same large city. It&#x27;s not like they separated by 100s of miles or anything.')
