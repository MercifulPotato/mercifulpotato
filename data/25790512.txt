Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610716123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787629, text='&gt; Twitter+FB+ a single-digit handful of other platforms are the only mechanisms for a private individual to share an idea and have it spread to a wide audience.<p>Bullshit. They&#x27;re merely the <i>easiest</i>. People were sharing ideas far and wide long before these companies came into existence. You have a right to free speech, no one is required to help you spread it.<p>&gt; A cafe owner refusing service to an individual is not comparable to a global-scale speech platform selectively suppressing ideas that the owner doesn&#x27;t like from reaching a wide audience.<p>Maybe not, but I&#x27;ve yet to see a good argument for why being a global scale speech platform inherently means that anyone has a right to tell Twitter who they can and cannot ban.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying there shouldn&#x27;t be consequences for Twitter, I&#x27;m just saying that those consequences should be <i>social</i>, not <i>legal</i>.<p>I feel like the people here are arguing that the reason they should face legal consequences isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;ve done anything illegal or that necessarily should be illegal, only that they don&#x27;t think social consequences will work and they can&#x27;t stand the idea that other people might not care as much about it as they do.')
