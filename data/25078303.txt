He was working in public relations for General Electric (in the early 1950s, I gather) when he sold his first story to Collier&#x27;s (a large-circulation magazine of the time). He wrote to his father that if he could sell five stories a year, he would make more than a year&#x27;s pay at GE.<p>But he wrote in 1986, &quot;the magazines had gone out of business, and I was suddenly in the position of having to write a whole book in order to get what used to be my fee for just one story.&quot;')
