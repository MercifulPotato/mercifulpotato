Because the only &quot;profit motive&quot; I&#x27;m seeing is that the bridge operator would want to avoid losing money on refunding tolls, and would be incentivized to provide towing services. But isn&#x27;t that bridge operator exactly the same government transportation authority that you are proposing doesn&#x27;t need to be involved in providing towing services? Or are you proposing that the day to day maintenance and operations of a piece of critical infrastructure should be privatized, and then subject to provisions that ensure it&#x27;s a risky&#x2F;bad investment?')
