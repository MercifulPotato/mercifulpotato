Poor integration between government and money.<p>2. Poor integration between different governments.<p>My impression is that many people are opposed to both of those things on the basis that governments have historically been horrible in many ways.<p>Probably will just get buried, but I would like to suggest that we don&#x27;t have an alternative.<p>Unless, maybe, you want to create something high-tech that can replace government.  Which I think would really be a new form of government.<p>It almost seems like we are moving towards one bad version of that.  Look at the power of companies like Google or Amazon etc or the ability of Uber to successfully ignore  laws. I guess this is another instance of #1.<p>I feel like somehow you need fair, functioning governments with control over money that work together globally.  A new type of high-tech money integrated with a new type of  high-tech government might be possible and if so maybe it could solve those problems.<p>Or you need a totally new paradigm where somehow the omnipotent mega-corporations (including the banks) start looking out for the interests of the people. That doesn&#x27;t seem workable given the motivations and structure of corporations.')
