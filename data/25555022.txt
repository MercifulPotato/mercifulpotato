I know this stuff can add up and people should be careful about racking up recurring charges for stuff they&#x27;re not really using or getting much value out of, but optimizing away $200&#x2F;mo doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge ROI.<p>If you&#x27;re paying people on your team, the most expensive thing you probably buy is a person&#x2F;hour of time.')
