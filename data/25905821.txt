The &quot;I Stole Gram Parsons&#x27; Body&quot; story is bizarre in a very HN way. An economic analysis of liquidity saving mechanisms explains how the modern economic payment system works. The Romeo File goes into an interesting facet of espionage history where the stasi targeted secretaries with &quot;Romeos&quot; to send information to the USSR. A practice that has reverberations to this day. When California Went to War over Eggs is a bizarre story about protein at the early west.<p>However, none of these received any interest. Which is frustrating. I try to share interesting things I find on HN, but it feels horrible to find something cool that you wish to share with the world and watch it slip into the endless void.<p>Unless, the submission generates outrage. Such as the Nintendo story. Or, IBM and the holocaust. Or, the Gorgon Stare. That&#x27;s what makes it to the front page. It is soul crushing to know that interesting stories about the time there was a very literal war over eggs won&#x27;t get as much attention as these clickbaity things. Which leads to a natural conclusion, the reason why the internet is so crap in general is because people like things that make them rage or feel strong emotions, and they reward it.<p>Dang&#x27;s inbox is always open, but it feels needy and depressing to email him repeatedly &quot;Hey, I submitted something great, have a look?&quot; I wish there was some way to fix this problem.<p>You can see my submissions here, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;submitted?id=areoform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;submitted?id=areoform</a>')
