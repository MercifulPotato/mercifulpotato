Any sane approach has to leave out step #2. That means that your Gitlab instance gets hammered with user spam from bots which then get indexed in Google search results for your site.<p>Worse, Gitlab has no tools to make it easy to remove the user spam (and obviously no tools to prevent it from happening).<p>Just run a public-facing Gitlab CE instance for a few days. Search for one of the spam snippets you collect, and you&#x27;ll find results for all the FOSS projects out there running their own Gitlab instances.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen any solutions offered by Gitlab for this, nor frankly any interest in the myriad bug reports about them addressing this at all.<p>Edit: typo')
