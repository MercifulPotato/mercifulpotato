It has caused us lost time in development and could also trip us up again. I consider it part of my job to figure out how to fix it and send a PR if I think it’s good enough quality. The idea of saying ‘we can’t do this because of a bug in X’ didn’t really cross my mind - because that’s the whole point of open source is it not? I can open up the source and debug and figure out a workaround or a fix.<p>Just because you’re not paying for it doesn’t mean it’s free, you’re still going to have to do some work.')
