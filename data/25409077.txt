I threaten to report your crime to the police unless you pay me.<p>The act being threatened – reporting your crime to the police – is totally legal, even socially encouraged. It is only the demanding of money (or other benefits) not to do it part which is the crime of blackmail.<p>If I just went ahead and reported your crime to the police – no crime of blackmail.<p>If I just didn&#x27;t – no blackmail (but could be some other crime, such as misprision)<p>It&#x27;s only when I tell you that whether I&#x27;m going to do it depends on whether you do something for me that blackmail has been committed.')
