Surveillance is easier too. IDK. Yes, Bezos does not want an amazon union and won&#x27;t just let it happen without a fight. Same as always. That said, if people want to hear what an amazon union organiser has to say... it&#x27;s almost impossible to stop it.<p>I don&#x27;t think the central factor here is Pinkertons.
