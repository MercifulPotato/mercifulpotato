I find Bing ads and Bing tracking far less problematic and insidious than Google&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s an interesting trade off, for sure. One interesting part of the trade off that Google doesn&#x27;t match (neither opt-out nor opt-in tracking) is &quot;Microsoft Rewards&quot; where Bing gives you a small cut of tracked ad fees in &quot;rewards points&quot; (like credit card&#x2F;frequent flyer &quot;mileage&quot; programs) that you can redeem for things like gift cards. Sure, it&#x27;s a cynical loyalty grab, but at least for me it shows that Microsoft still prefers to be a product company at the end of the day and is a little less likely to fall into the evil opt-out only panopticon tracking ad direction that Google has. Obviously other people&#x27;s opinions vary, and many are loathe to trust Microsoft, but it&#x27;s an interesting trade-off to be aware of.')
