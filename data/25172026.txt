It <i>imports</i> domain models which are totally isolated from the rest of the dependencies. The data doesn&#x27;t even have to be in the database and can come from multiple sources such as S3 or whatever. It can consume data from the user and kick off various processes or insert into the database. It is a generic <i>interface</i> that does more than just CRUD in the DB.')
