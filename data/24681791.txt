The fundamentals though exist as a little voice in the back of your head reminding you not to do something that won’t work.<p>I think this is why the US govt has been pushing STEM majors because there is a serious lack of people that understand &#x27;advanced&#x27; math. I&#x27;m learning some fundamentals as we speak and it means nothing if you can&#x27;t connect the dots. Understanding these concepts is the start but using them and experiencing them is where the real &#x27;magic&#x27; happens. Except not many get that far.<p>Keep up the great work gaze!')
