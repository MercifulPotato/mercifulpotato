But then that gets me into the territory of &quot;it&#x27;s A Big Deal if this goes down,&quot; so I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I also sell a premium version of the software with some extra features. Customers get it free when they buy a device. They keep the software forever, but after 1 year, they can pay some amount every month to continue receiving updates. I&#x27;m still kind of iffy on my strategy here, though. The first renewals aren&#x27;t up until January 2022, so I might do something different by then.')
