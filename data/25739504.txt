I also don&#x27;t like what happened and would love to figure out ways to ensure a better functioning society.<p>However, I think where we may differ is how we think about solutions to problems like this. I want solutions that are scalable, and that help maintain a society where a diversity of people can all thrive over the long-term. I don&#x27;t believe emotional reasoning should be a strong factor in determining punishments for people, as it leads to bias and discrimination.<p>Most vocal people you see on the internet don&#x27;t seem particularly interested in long-term&#x2F;scalable solutions. It&#x27;s not terribly surprising, we humans are very short-term oriented and tribal by nature. When we see members of the outgroup performing badly, we want to punish them. When members of our own ingroup perform badly, we are more likely to rationalize it away and be more charitable with the interpretation of what they&#x27;ve done.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the &#x27;punish the outgroup, forgive the ingroup&#x27; thinking is healthy for a functioning pluralistic society. The words you are using and the way you are framing things are signals to me that you may be fairly biased against your outgroup. That&#x27;s why I was asking you to spell out exactly what rules should govern punishment in your mind.<p>The next step in critically thinking through your proposed rules is whether you would punish members of your ingroup for violating them, or if you&#x27;d add new caveats to ensure they were given some leniency. But that&#x27;s just a rhetorical question given the nature of this forum.<p>Note: I am making no claims of equivalence between your outgroup and ingroup in terms of actions they&#x27;ve done. You also likely think I&#x27;m part of your outgroup for straying from the status quo by even posing such questions, and may feel inclined to use terms reserved for your outgroup. You&#x27;d be mistaken, but I understand the impulse.')
