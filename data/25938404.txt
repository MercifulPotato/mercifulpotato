That way might be easier across the board.<p>I would propose as an alternative that we work to improve general scientific literacy so that the general public might be more familiar with the methods used in each field. For example, if more people knew how regression analysis worked they might be better able to understand it as the foundation for many of the conclusions in the social sciences, and so might be better able to understand the generalizability and potential limitations of what they are seeing when they are presented with a conclusion in one of these fields.')
