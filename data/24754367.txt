So if you&#x27;re already doing it right, you never end up fighting it, since you&#x27;re already obeying the &quot;single writer XOR multiple readers&quot; principle. It simply checks that you haven&#x27;t broken what was already best practice.<p>As an embedded dev one of the things I love about Rust is the ability to use the type system to enforce the machine&#x27;s invariants. Some register has a bunch of bit fields? Break it up using a struct, and unlike C&#x27;s struct bitfield notation you don&#x27;t have to shift the values around every time.<p>Rust forces you to check all enum variants, not just in switch statements like C (and that only with the -Wswitch-enum or equivalent warning) and disallows any unlisted value (there&#x27;s no &quot;default&quot; for an enum).<p>Those things alone probably aren&#x27;t enough to switch, but as a machine-focused embedded dev they&#x27;re certainly nice to have.')
