When &quot;follow your Dreams&quot; leads to this....well did you really dreamed about it that way? Where is the fun? \nLooks like one becomes a &quot;business&quot; brainwashed robot spending way to much lifetime at doing ???????? just playing &#x27;respect&#x27; to ego psychos for an in fact empty basket filled with $$$ paper.<p>Listen to signals your body sends, if there is no fun soon, it means STOP. Oh yeah you can watch datapoints, brainscans and talk to experts for years, but listen to what you <i>feel</i> is enough. It is hard to beat that &quot;intelligence&quot; sensor encorporated in the human shaped by thousends of years of evolution.<p>I wish this guy al the best, this maybe is the best thing he ever did.<p>I hope he can find back to a more satisfying life with lots of lifetime, enjoying doing fun things with his family!<p>No need to track down that destructive board member. He is sitting at work right in front of you on a basket with $$$, you listen to him as you think you need it for food and if you are priviledged for &quot;dreams&quot;.. maybe just look in a mirror ?')
