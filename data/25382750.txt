I don’t know what is in other peoples’ minds. I’m just telling you how I look at things. I‘m already rich, but even when I wasn’t I was never motivated by envy or hatred of those who had more than I did.<p>As far zoning and hospitality regulations: it is scarcely exaggeration to say that a municipality can come close to ruining your life, and certainly your personal fortune, through whimsical application of them.

I live in Seattle, where they will cheerfully shut down your business for weeks because you have an electrical outlet 6 inches too close to the wall.')
