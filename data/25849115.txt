You&#x27;re not being principled, you&#x27;re being greedy.<p>You don&#x27;t like its efficiencies?  Help fix it.  You don&#x27;t want any of its services?  Let&#x27;s see how long you last without them, especially the police and military protecting that wealth.  It&#x27;s all a social contract and you don&#x27;t get the services but get to opt out of paying for them because you got more and realized that you&#x27;re a greedy, shitty little scumbag.')
