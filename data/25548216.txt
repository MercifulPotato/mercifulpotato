Apple is a premium brand, for the premium segment of the market. It is never going to have a majority of the marketshare, it isn&#x27;t interested in going down that path.<p>Apple Silicon offers great performance, but a massive chunk of the market cares more about price than performance â€“ that chunk isn&#x27;t really interested in Apple Silicon, and Apple isn&#x27;t really that interested in them either.')
