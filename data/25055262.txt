Fatfinger :)<p>The Freeway revolts, yes. They are exoterically held up today as an example of early environmentalism and even anti-racism, but when I started learning about the history, the groups responsible, and the demographic changes that were happening at the time a very different esoteric picture emerged.<p>Check out the cover story of the 1954 edition of &quot;The Negro Traveler&#x27;s Green Book&quot; (pages 11–18, inclusive) about how San Francisco is &quot;fast becoming the focal point of the Negros&#x27; future&quot; despite &quot;being squeezed into two areas of San Francisco today&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcollections.nypl.org&#x2F;items&#x2F;3c85ba30-9374-0132-9292-58d385a7b928&#x2F;book#page&#x2F;13&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcollections.nypl.org&#x2F;items&#x2F;3c85ba30-9374-0132...</a><p>Then realize that one of those two areas (Western Addition &#x2F; Fillmore area) was connected to the Central Freeway by the former Turk &#x2F; Golden Gate ramps and that <i>that&#x27;s</i> when the fervor against the Western Freeway started in earnest.<p>And now so much for that formerly-bright future: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;priceonomics&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-african-american-exodus-from-san-francisco&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;priceonomics&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-afr...</a><p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s totally coincidental that the conversion of the north-of-Market segment of the Central Freeway into Octavia Blvd kept the Oak&#x2F;Fell connection but blocked the Turk&#x2F;GGate connection entirely.<p>Just imagine what today&#x27;s SF could be like if every new piece of architecture wasn&#x27;t &quot;hostile architecture&quot;. The pre-1956 appearance of Civic Center Plaza might be an indication: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;u30i14rbd3e51.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;u30i14rbd3e51.jpg</a><p>edit: I forgot to mention that Lincoln High is in a neighborhood that explicitly banned sale to non-whites via redlining and racial deed covenants:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;default.sfplanning.org&#x2F;Preservation&#x2F;sunset_survey&#x2F;Adopted_SunsetHCS.pdf#page=28" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;default.sfplanning.org&#x2F;Preservation&#x2F;sunset_survey&#x2F;Ad...</a><p>&quot;In San Francisco, many of the largest private builders of  the 1920s to 1950s—such as Baldwin &amp; Howell Henry Doelger,  Standard Building Company, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (Parkmerced)—included racial covenants or  discriminatory practices prohibiting non-Caucasians from purchasing and&#x2F;or renting properties, particularly in the  western and southwestern area of San Francisco. It is  interesting to note, however, that Sunset District builders typically did not adopt racially restrictive deeds until  the late 1930s.&quot;<p>The Western Freeway, of course, would have connected these neighborhoods quickly up to all the others. As to why the Sunset District didn&#x27;t adopt racial covenants until the 1930s, I wager it might have something to do with most of it not existing yet :)<p>This is what the Sunset Ave area looked like in 1938, for example: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidrumsey.com&#x2F;luna&#x2F;servlet&#x2F;s&#x2F;e0zozf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidrumsey.com&#x2F;luna&#x2F;servlet&#x2F;s&#x2F;e0zozf</a>')
