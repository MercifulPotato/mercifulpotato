He&#x27;s just stating that you can use the confirmation one for onboarding too.<p>I have seen those separated emails. I agree that they add nothing, and I imagine their conversion is much lower than a single email (they don&#x27;t bother me, I&#x27;ll just ignore another message). I do agree that onboarding is best done on-channel, but adding an extra link on the email you are sending anyway can only help.')
