There are recovery procedures (possibly intrusive or troublesome) for soft bricked.<p>As an example, if I have a network device so screwed up that I have to do a little power and connection dance to get it to reload via tftp, I&#x27;d call that a soft brick. If I have to solder in jtag pins, that&#x27;s pretty firm. If the magic smoke has come out, that&#x27;s definitely hard.')
