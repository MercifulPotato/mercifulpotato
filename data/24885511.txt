Item(by='LockAndLol', descendants=None, kids=[24885554], score=None, time=1603626012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866595, text='&gt; Soleh et al. tested the device on six samples of dried chilies dissolved in an ethanol-based solution. They placed a drop in the detection chamber and found that the device could accurately measure concentrations of capsaicin in all six samples.<p>So in order to use this right now, you need to dry and dissolve the chili? This definitely doesn&#x27;t sound like something a normal consumer could use by e.g squeezing a chili and putting a few drops into the device... or does it?<p>From the abstract <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.acs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;acsanm.0c02079" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.acs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;acsanm.0c02079</a><p>&gt; Thus, this platform shows excellent potential for the development of portable sensors for capsaicin and future extension to different analytes.<p>Maybe that means the delivery method still has to be improved.')
