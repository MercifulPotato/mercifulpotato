At least, it&#x27;s true of the religions I know things about (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, in that order, with exponential decay in my knowledge as you go down the list...).<p>The funny thing is that Taleb is making something of the same point, but still makes that mistake when it comes time to talk about theology.')
