Such as not having horrendous file mount performance on Windows mounted drives, not having to worry about WSL 2&#x27;s VM eating up and not reclaiming your disk space and memory. But let&#x27;s ignore those things because IMO they will be fixed in due time.<p>Windows is way behind the curve with tiled window managers vs native Linux and while technically you can run VcXsrv and run a tiled window manager through WSL 2, it totally fails on multiple monitors and also requires installing everything within WSL&#x27;s file system. It just feels like you&#x27;re battling 2 operating systems.<p>Also from a &quot;just let me use my own computer as I wish&quot; perspective, Windows is still spying on you with telemetry even with basic mode and using Windows Pro and it forces updates on you. This likely will never change and if you lived in a world where you could run everything you wanted on either Windows or Linux, I think most people would probably opt to have the OS that doesn&#x27;t spy on you and reboot on its own right?<p>IMO native Linux is more than just features vs lack of features. It&#x27;s a whole mindset shift on how everything works and how you can mold your dev environment to do exactly what you want instead of being forced on what to do by some company. I would switch to native Linux in a heartbeat if Davinci Resolve worked well on my hardware (a video editing tool that runs on Linux). Video editing is the only use case stopping me from switching.')
