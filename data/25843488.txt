(Actually, I think delivery is incomplete without acceptance.) Theoretically an incoming president could recall the pardon if it hasn&#x27;t been delivered. Not sure what may constitute as delivery; or acceptance, for that matter. I don&#x27;t think the manner of delivery or acceptance has been tested, let alone enumerated. If it&#x27;s as simple as a phone call, then presumably nothing could be done.<p>I think a more interesting question is whether there&#x27;s a specificity requirement. AFAIU, that hasn&#x27;t been answered, either.')
