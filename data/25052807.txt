Many of the laws that attempt to do so, backfire with unintended consequences.<p>It is quite possible that your solution might be just that -- many industries with high security needs are already very concerned with hardware tampering.  A common current solution for this is &quot;burner&quot; hardware.  It is not uncommon for the Fortune 500 to give employees laptops that are used for a single trip to China, and then thrown away.   Tech that can give the user assurance that the device hasn&#x27;t been compromised <i>decreases</i> the chance that these devices will be disposed of.<p>As a side note, I don&#x27;t think serialized components is even one of the top 25 factors that does(&#x2F;would) contribute to unnecessary electronics disposal.')
