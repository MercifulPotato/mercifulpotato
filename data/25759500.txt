It&#x27;s not made to work together. I&#x27;m not a python dev so it was very confusing to figure out what is going on, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it would be similar if you mix npm and deb packages for js libs. They don&#x27;t know of each other and can&#x27;t know which libs were anyway provided by the other, then search paths are unknown to the user etc. I think I went through similar pain when I had to get some ruby project going.<p>My gut feeling is that it would be best if debian only supplied the package of the software in question and let&#x27;s the &quot;native&quot; dependency management tool handle all the libs, but I guess that would get the debian folks the feeling of loss of control, as it indeed makes it impossible to backport a fix for specific libs; rather you&#x27;d have to fiddle with the dependency tree somehow.')
