You mean a save dialog?<p>Note that on windows there are at least 3 generations of save dialogs. Which one you see depends on which generation of the api is used.<p>The most common one is the more modern which is basically just an explorer window. Dragging a file into an explorer window works that same regardless of whether it’s an open&#x2F;save dialog or not. It’s a move&#x2F;copy operation (depending on e.g modifier keys).<p>I didn’t quite get the point of dragging a file to a save dialog at all though? (Assuming that’s what you meant by panel) is it that you <i>wanted</i> to use it for navigate+set-name? That to me as a windows user seems alien. I expect it to work as an explorer window! Expectations are everything. The principle of least surprise doesn’t really work cross platform I guess.')
