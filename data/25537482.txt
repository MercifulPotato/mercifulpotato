One thing that I dislike here is this: we are starting somehow with the premise that people are malformed.<p>The job of a manager is not to mold people into correct shapes. Unless you are dealing with trivial work, you cannot bend other intelligent beings to your tyrannical circle shaped will.<p>If you are a triangle, the manager is supposed to help you be the best triangle you can be. They are supposed to arrange and connect the pieces of the puzzle together.<p>Instead, this manager believes that is the managers job to mold their units into identical circles. Disgusting.')
