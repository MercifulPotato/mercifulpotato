Not really, but the application itself as provided by the docker image isn&#x27;t really vulnerable in practice as it doesn&#x27;t use curl.<p>But, all these vulnerability scanning tools have no way to determine if curl is used or not, so they just scream &quot;security vulnerability&quot;.  Where a more nuanced take would be, the application probably isn&#x27;t vulnerable due to curl being installed, but it probably be better to create a leaner image.')
