Most of the time Spotify&#x27;s recommended music is just other songs by my favorite artists that I&#x27;ve already listened to 100x, on their platform. If they can&#x27;t predict what I will like outside of the artists&#x2F;genres I already listen to, I doubt they can make any predictions based on infinitely more noisy data points.<p>They can&#x27;t even differentiate artists with the same fucking name.')
