Noam Chomsky is more of rationalist.<p>LessWrong-rationalism is just crackpottery.<p>This brings to mind a review of Stephen Hicks “Explaining Postmodernism”.  In the book he contrasts postmodernism with objectivism: postmodernists are irrational while objectivists are rational.  And once you look long enough at the comparison tables you realize that there is no philosophy there; it’s just “bad thing” v.s. “good thing”.<p>Kind of like “rationalism”, that obvious good thing.  Who wouldn’t want to be rational?  What’s our philosophy?  Uh, to be rational?  To be for good things and against bad things?<p>Hence your indignation at putting pseudo in front of that word: how could one possibly object to something called rationalism?  Hello, it’s in the name—rationalism!  It’s about being rational.  What more do you want, Jack?<p>“Per se”...<p>And nice touch with the but-religion-though.  That was a zinger.')
