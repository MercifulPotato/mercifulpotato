I spend 4 years working a job I hated (plus all the time building up to that job) to save the money to take a year off and do my own thing.<p>The first 2 years went amazingly well, I was very lucky. The last 2 have been pretty rough. A combination of government crackdowns (I&#x27;m a brit) on self employed people, brexit and now covid has pretty much done for me. I have enough cash for 3 more months.<p>I wish I could have started 2+ years earlier with a loan from mum or dad. I wish I could continue now with the same. But they&#x27;re poor. I suspect I will be too if I don&#x27;t get a job or a major sale soon.')
