Starting using Stan is a bit difficult though, as it has a C like programming language that is difficult to master initially. Especially since statistics is usually done in languages like R, so the learning curve is a bit steep for beginners.<p>I&#x27;ve personally liked PyMC for simple models and relative ease of inference, as it&#x27;s more integrated with the Python language. That being said, if you want the latest in inference methods and statistical alchemy, Stan is the place to go.')
