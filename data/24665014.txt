I have worked back-end, front-end (web and native, mobile and desktop), databases and testing throughout my time. Throughout my career I have developed a systemic view point and an ability to understand how different components of a project and different teams interact. I formed a T-shaped domain of knowledge with database architecture being the leg of the T. Due to my experience, I am currently aiming for a software architect role, or a role with growth opportunities toward a similar tech leadership position. From a tech stack I am most excited by opportunities to work in Rust and opportunities to work on free open source software. If you are looking to make the world a better place and need an engineer don&#x27;t hesitate to ping me.')
