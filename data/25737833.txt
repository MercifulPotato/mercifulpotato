AWS is a whole lot closer to &quot;essential public infrastructure&quot; than, say, Twitter or Facebook.  (Or Zendesk or Twilio or any of the myriad service providers that Parler happened to use.)<p>Where does it end?<p>Can the local utility provider that serves Parler&#x27;s physical office decided to &quot;deplatform&quot; them and revoke their access to electricity?<p>Can the small handful of Tier 1 transit providers (which together make up &quot;the Internet&quot; as we know it) decide to deplatform a network by refusing to peer with it?  [What if they extend that depeering to include any <i>other</i> networks (Tier 2 etc.) which refuse to stop peering with the target network?]<p>Sure, that&#x27;s just a hypothetical right now, but then again last week &quot;AWS decides to terminate you&quot; was one of those hypothetical but very unlikely risks.  How far is this witch hunt going to go?<p>[Sadly, given recent discourse here, I feel compelled to state that I strongly disagree with the content posted on Parler, which was indeed some truly awful stuff.]')
