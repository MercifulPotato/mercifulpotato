Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25060743], score=None, time=1605114823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25056166, text='&gt; I can assure you I have no idea who &quot;rushan abbas&quot; is.<p>And I can assure you that you are lying. Why lie about it?<p>&gt; Pray tell, what changed your mind about the Falun Gong?<p>The fact that they are a crazy lunatic cult conjured up by intelligence agencies?<p>What funny is that &quot;china&quot; always steals organs when there is an issue with the west. When Bush had a problem with china, then all of a sudden they are creating death camps and stealing organs. Then nothing for years. Now trump has an issue with china and all of a sudden &quot;death camps&quot; and they are &quot;stealing organs&quot;. I&#x27;ll make a bet with you. Once the trade issue with china is resolved these stories about ugyhurs and &quot;stealing organs&quot; will magically disappear.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; lol, I mean, I&#x27;m not exactly going to post a photo of myself holding up the New York Times to placate your wild accusations<p>Wild accusations? My &quot;Is it you rushan abbas?&quot; was an obvious joke. I was just showing you an example of a propagandist that&#x27;s running wild all over traditional and social media. That you took it this seriously and are still taking it this seriously tells me everything I need to know. lol.<p>&gt; But you said you believed in it then you stopped -- my question is why did you believe it, and follow up, why did you stop?<p>I believed in it because I was young and naive. I stopped because I learned what it was about. I also believed we invaded iraq for &quot;freedom&quot; - once again young and naive. Now I know it was all bullshit.<p>&gt; Why would that reflect reality? You don&#x27;t think the US media caters to political expediencies? Remember how Saddam had weapons of mass destruction?<p>That&#x27;s my point. The media lies. It&#x27;s all propaganda. What do you think bitterwinter is?')
