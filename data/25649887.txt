The most popular Python and Java libraries seem to love endless layers of indirection, and when it doesn&#x27;t fit exactly what you need, you bang your head against the wall monkeypatching it to make it work since your whole app is already written in X mega library.<p>Go culture seems to be quite a bit more boilerplate-y and uses smaller more composable libraries. It&#x27;s just refreshing.<p>Really I just need to buckle down on Rust, but I think it&#x27;s a fair bet that teams and shops that bring in a lot of young programmers and want to ramp them up fast may cringe a bit at the learning curve of Rust.<p>That&#x27;s why for now in terms of a bet on employability, I am prioritizing experience with Go.')
