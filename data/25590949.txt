I&#x27;m very early into a first grow and it&#x27;s so exciting seeing your first baby leaves growing.<p>It finally feels like I&#x27;m putting my college physics to use and building on it. You&#x27;re trying to control the environment, with many different factors, as perfectly as you can. To do it well, you have to understand the principles behind each different factor.<p>E.g.: In controlling temps and humidity which is important for plant respiration, why does a lower temperature hold less moisture? Heat is kinetic energy, and a higher temp (more heat) means more molecules on avg have enough energy to become a gas.')
