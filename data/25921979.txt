Item(by='gnramires', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611701439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25921540, text='&gt; I&#x27;m curious about their cache invalidation solution<p>My guess: there would be a model somewhere (probably a binary relay map of walls) of the maze, and as soon as the mouse hits an inconsistency, this map is updated. So there isn&#x27;t really a cache, it&#x27;s more like a model, or perhaps you can think of collision-based cache (model) invalidation. The mouse probably then follows the solution to this modified maze, modified only insofar as it has measured modifications.<p>Is there a technical specification somewhere? I&#x27;d certainly be curious to read it.')
