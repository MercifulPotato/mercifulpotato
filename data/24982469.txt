Advances in DNA matching technology beyond what we imagined possible in 2020 have occurred. Detective Williams submits the preserved DNA to the US National DNA Registry (DNAR). Within minutes an exceptionally high probability grandparent match is returned. The record had been added just 8 days previous, but was a sealed record.

Per subsection 15 of the act on permissible information release, the requested records year of birth is: 2045.&quot;')
