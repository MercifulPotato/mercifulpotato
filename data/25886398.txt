The planes only have to follow the ATC orders and not worry about other planes except for very rare emergencies. Even in those, ATC usually gives them a large block away from other planes to sort things out.<p>Cars in comparison can start at any moment, from any location and want to go anywhere they like without knowing what other cars are doing, or -worse- the road conditions (potholes, ice etc).<p>Putting blame is also easier, because legally all pilots agree to be recorded while flying since they&#x27;re doing business. It&#x27;ll be much harder I guess to allow recording inside cars.')
