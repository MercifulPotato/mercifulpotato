Item(by='rurp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607627667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376634, text='&gt; You learn dedication at university.<p>Everyone I know, including myself, who came to software engineering outside of the standard academic route needed to make a huge commitment. Pretty much everyone who goes down this path faces a large cost in terms of the time commitment required to learn a new discipline, the price of training materials (boot camps, online courses, etc), and the opportunity cost of leaving an existing job to take a chance on a new entry level one.<p>I personally switched to software development from a decent but mind-numbing career. The first couple years were really rough as I lived off of dwindling savings trying to learn and pick up enough entry level work to get by.<p>Going the computer science degree &gt; intern or entry level position &gt; good engineering job route is both difficult and full of valuable experiences, but it&#x27;s also the most cookie cutter approach with the clearest guardrails.<p>The notion that only the most dedicated people can make it through the experience of a comp sci college course in their early 20s is hogwash in my opinion. I have a 4 year degree in an different field and that was a MUCH easier path than breaking into the software dev business with a self taught and boot camp background.')
