It is functioning as intended and is very unlikely to be reformed to favor the public interest.<p>If anything, the next DMCA will be tilted even further towards publisher interests. The latest EU publisher payout copyright &#x27;reform&#x27; -- which, among other things, banned photography of buildings and skylines -- is the most likely model for the next US copyright &#x27;reform&#x27; measure.<p>Congress only passes laws that large piles of money pay for[0], so the only prospect of copyright <i>reform</i> is if someone puts up a billion dollars in campaign contributions (bribes). Further money may be needed to re-stack the judiciary to ensure a reform will survive the wide-eyed fanatics on the USSC. This scenario is deeply unlikely as piles of money large enough to afford to spend a billion dollars purchasing legislation are very happy with the law as it stands.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;services&#x2F;aop-cambridge-core&#x2F;content&#x2F;view&#x2F;62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B&#x2F;S1537592714001595a.pdf&#x2F;testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;services&#x2F;aop-cambridge-core&#x2F;c...</a>')
