Any good electrician knows you can’t run power and data in the same conduit or pathway. NEC requires a divider in any junction box that contains low-voltage and line-voltage power, and also requires separate conduits&#x2F;pathways for low-voltage and line-voltage power (can’t use the same stud hole to feed both through)<p>Spend more money on the electrician, and they’ll be better at their jobs.<p>Edit: I run electrical work')
