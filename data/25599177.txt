Given the fact he had his wife and another child I&#x27;d presume it&#x27;s highly likely that it wasn&#x27;t though.<p>I remember finding out about his kid dying a bit after it happened. Mainly because every few months I&#x27;d check in to see if there&#x27;s any word on anything new coming out - things had come to a bit of a lull. Then around a year after his kids death, once again checking back in for anything new - I&#x27;d seen somebody say something along the lines of &quot;His teen son fucking died man. For all we know, he could seriously want nothing to do with rapping anymore after such a big and shitty life event&quot;<p>For whatever reason, that logic definitely struck a chord with me. Pretty much cut my expectations for new material and left me with being thankful for everything he&#x27;d made.<p>While I&#x27;d enjoy knowing the cause of death, I respect the privacy of his family more and understand it may never come out.')
