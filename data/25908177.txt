If 60% of the population believes the truth (for the sake of argument) and 40% believes another, the 40% can still do quite a bit of damage by intentionally spreading misinformation (causing confusion and chaos that the 60% have to distract themselves from) and&#x2F;or violence (government overthrow doesn’t have to come from the majority).<p>Similarly, it’s not hard to imagine that if the minority is the one that’s correct, the majority can cause some damage enforcing the belief that the emperor is indeed wearing clothes.<p>The truth is the thing that needs protection, not speech. The challenge is that objective truth can be epistemologically difficult to protect without protecting lies (or conversely fighting falsehoods can inadvertently end up fighting some truths).')
