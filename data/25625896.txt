It&#x27;s absolutely superior to C# or Java in many ways. One notable drawback is &quot;how much code can new hires write in their first month&quot; which is not a metric I consider that important for big enough projects. The month or so needed to skill up a C# or Java programmer in F# is a drop in the bucket compared to the benefits it brought us.')
