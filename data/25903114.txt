The fact is, this is the norm to all forms of gov, all across the world, since the beginning of any form of ruling body. There are pockets where it&#x27;s better or worse, but what you described is part of the norm, no matter the political party.<p>While that sounds super debbie downer, I think the reason it&#x27;s this way is the open secretiveness of politics. Everything is out in the open, but no one cares. If the general public applied the same amount of passion and reseach for celebrities, the latest Star Wars&#x2F;Marvel show or games to the local, state or fed gov affairs, the amount of gov ineptitude and corruption would be a fraction of what it is today. Even more so, representative gov is supposed to make that a whole hell of a lot easier for the public. Hold the few experts accountable that can better trudge through everyday politics. But... that&#x27;s all wishful thinking and ranting.')
