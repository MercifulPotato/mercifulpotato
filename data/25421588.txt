I have a bunch of home automation devices and I’m planning for more. Most of them don’t require any internet connectivity, the only one that does (I still have Alexa connected to Home Assistant, planning to replace her with Rhasspy but didn’t find the time yet) is purely an extra method of controlling things so nothing breaks without internet.<p>I see people buying internet-required devices as the same people who buy the registry cleaners. They don’t know enough about computers themselves, and the advertorials&#x2F;computer magazines don’t do them any favors.')
