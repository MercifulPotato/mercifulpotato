I&#x27;d highly recommend having that additional field (that isn&#x27;t personally identifying data either which is where I assume the concern is) if you run this experiment again - which I hope you do with better load times, things like different torso sizes - as proportion of breasts to torso size has an impact, etc. Still kudos to you for the work.')
