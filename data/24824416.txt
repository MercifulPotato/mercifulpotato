IKEA has greatly sped up their &#x27;upgrade&#x27; cycle lately. Somethings are around unchanged year after year, but more and more things aren&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve had several cases where I came back to IKEA 2 years later and wanted to expand or replace a thing in a furniture series only to find it discontinued.')
