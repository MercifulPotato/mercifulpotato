It&#x27;s effectively nothing more than a big HTML form with some inputs, something that&#x27;s been around and working perfectly fine in browsers for <i>decades</i>.<p>The other comment here about how it&#x27;s like complaining it does not work in IE6 is really pertinent: Yes it damn well should, because I should not need the latest technology just to do something that would&#x27;ve been perfectly possible with the technology of TWO DECADES AGO. It should be entirely possible to use GitHub with a <i>text-based browser</i> because none of its interactions require anything more than that.<p>It&#x27;s sad that I could probably write a more accessible interface in less time and resources, and I haven&#x27;t even done much in the way of web development, yet dedicated web-developers with uninhibited trendchasing mentality will fuck it up so badly with this constant need for useless breaking changes.<p>Seriously, fuck this &quot;modern&quot; bullshit.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23136688" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23136688</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19664509" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19664509</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18486124" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18486124</a>')
