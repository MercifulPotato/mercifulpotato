What&#x27;s protecting you or me from similarly popular accusations that might be false in our case? Should we only use Stripe and AWS if we are certain we&#x27;ll never do, say, or be associated with something that might upset half the population of the USA or a few people in power? Wikileaks upset a lot of people and got banned by VISA and others, for example. Without any wrongdoing in my opinion.<p>For my business sense, being dependant on AWS, Stripe, Shopify or other politically motivated organizations is a risky situation I&#x27;d rather avoid. YMMV.')
