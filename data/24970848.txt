They are doing them a favor. It would be completely different if they were saying they couldn&#x27;t shop there, just like if you intentionally look for women doctor&#x27;s to tell them that you think they are inferior or if you look for dark skinned people on dating websites to tell them you don&#x27;t like their race. I personally see no positive effects from advertising whatsoever, and am better off if a company thinks I&#x27;m too old or whatever to sell their product to.')
