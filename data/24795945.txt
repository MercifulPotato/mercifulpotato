I don&#x27;t see a problem with enforcing neutrality on platforms, in the same way that I don&#x27;t see a problem with enforcing it on my phone company, or my ISP.<p>&gt; Do you think HN would be a better place<p>I think the old school reddit model is a reasonable goal to aim for for these types of platforms.<p>(yes reddit has taken down some communities as of late, but lets assume that this didn&#x27;t happen, to clarify the example)<p>IE, delegating moderation to users, but allowing communities in general to be created, with their own sets of rules, feels pretty fair and neutral.<p>&gt;  I still donâ€™t understand what outcome you want for social media. How do you imagine it will look?<p>The model would be that any form of &quot;moderation&quot; on non-illegal content would be driven entirely by users, or communities of users.<p>IE, we can still allow people to do things like have shared block lists, or even curated communities <i>within</i> that platform, as long as other users are <i>also</i> able to create their own communities on that platform, that ignore those sets of rules.<p>Users could still make the choice to have certain rules, or moderation, if that is what they want.<p>Or, in other words, the reddit model, but without reddit removing non-illegal communities (which, to be fair, doesn&#x27;t happen <i>that</i> often on reddit anyway.  Reddit still mostly tries to be neutral, and they do an ok job with it)<p>EX: if a user doesn&#x27;t want to see NSFW stuff, or trolling, or &quot;misinformation&quot;, or any other offensive content, then there could be general categories, that describe those things, and the user can have that as a setting to not see that stuff.')
