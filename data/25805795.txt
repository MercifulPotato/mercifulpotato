Or maybe that their backup file encryption wasn&#x27;t that great. I am not sure about these claims, but <i>I migrated to Aegis</i>, that could nicely import AndOTP tokens.<p>Nowadays, I use it in combination with bitwarden (it supports OTP), which I use for my less important accounts. Bitwarden (self-hosted with bitwarden-rs) allows me to generate those without my phone. I still keep every token in Aegis as well.<p>AndOTP features I miss with Aegis:<p>- Icon library for common websites using OTP<p>- Maybe Steam OTP support? I never used it though, since it would more or less lock me out of trading, without the app, so I use e-mail.')
