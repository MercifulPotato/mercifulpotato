The Culture of Success is simple: If you are a founder, you have to be Perfect Fit, you have to design your idea around what VC&#x27;s want to hear and this is working model.\nOne of the reasons that I never work with or for startups. Founders are rarely competent to select the right people, in most cases they lack experience in HR or Product Design, etc. \nBootstrapping is a detector for true products, you scale on a merit of real customer base not on some Valuable Idea for VC investment.')
