Exactly which resources are would scarce for such a colony is challenging to predict but guess humans - living indefinitely in 38% of earth gravity probably isn&#x27;t possible and even reproduction would likely be harder still. A colonized Martian environment is going to be one big room&#x2F;box for a long time. Also, it&#x27;s not just raw materials that are going to be scarce. Microprocessors, chips, as an example, require continent-scale support&#x2F;supply-chains on earth, where most things are easy. Vacuum is cheaper on Mars but not free like in space and all sort of other things are harder.')
