A six-figure job in America is pretty much the only light at the end of the tunnel for them.<p>Sometimes Waterloo kids take friendly jabs at the other school in the city, Wilfried Laurier. But the image of the two schools couldn&#x27;t be more different. WLU is the party school that grades on a curve. Waterloo is much harsher academically, and the jokes and memes are usually focused on CS&#x2F;Math kids having no friends, playing DoTA and waiting for their summer placements in SV.')
