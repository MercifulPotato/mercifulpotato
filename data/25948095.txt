In the West, I would say that it would be more accurate to look at it through the lens of the cold war, though. Communism and radicalism were to be prevented and so freedom of speech was necessarily curtailed. In the East, it was likewise curtailed, ostensibly to &#x27;protect the youth&#x27; and &#x27;prevent disinformation&#x27; but with more potential for immediate consequences.<p>&gt;Is that ever in the public debate in the USA? Reasonable limits to free speech?<p>Sure. It&#x27;s been debated a lot, actually. Laws have changed significantly over the last hundred years, almost entirely to the expansion of free speech side.')
