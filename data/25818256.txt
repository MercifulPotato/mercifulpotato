He&#x27;s coming at it from the perspective of somebody who buys tools to use in heavy industry.  If you&#x27;re buying a cordless drill to hang pictures or maybe build a desk or a fence once a decade, the things he derides as being &quot;not very skookum&quot; will likely last you a lifetime.<p>Maybe you actually do need an angle grinder rated for an 8-hour duty cycle.
