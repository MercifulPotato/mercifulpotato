I can assume everyone who uses my library is a responsible adult and I can treat them as that.<p>Totally agree, as an user, I feel anxious whenever I have to use underscored names. It&#x27;s great that Python still allows me to do it and there were few times when it was useful, but when it stops working I know it&#x27;s 100% on me.')
