At the same time in India where manufacturing is far more efficient they have the opportunity to export as many manufactured goods to NZ as they want.<p>If the Indian government wants to tax their manufacturers to provide support to their now unemployed dairy farmers they are free to do so but ultimately both countries are better off with India paying overall less for dairy and NZ paying less for manufactured goods.')
