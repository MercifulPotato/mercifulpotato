SF is already a dumpster fire, if enough affluent people leave, property prices will tank and you will be paying off a mortgage for a larger sum than what the property is worth.<p>Meanwhile, all these affluent people have to move <i>somewhere</i>, the properties in these places aren&#x27;t going to stay cheap forever. So you can get a cheaper mortgage in those places to pay off a property that will rise in value.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s all speculation. Prices in the &quot;good places&quot; are already high anyway, if you really want to strike a bargain you have to buy into the places that are still up-and-coming.')
