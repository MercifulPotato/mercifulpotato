The shows, the news, the ads, and whatever else there was, they all had the same &quot;air&quot;. The same kind of music, the same kind of cadence, the same kind of tone, the same kind of fake laugh.<p>TV is pretty shit everywhere; but I can&#x27;t understand it in US.<p>Confusingly, some of the greatest TV shows are US shows. But I have to watch them on Netflix&#x2F;DVD, because the actual TV breaks apart the show into tiny pieces that take away the enjoyment entirely.<p>I consider myself lucky that I never get sucked into the habit of watching TV.')
