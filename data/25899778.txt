I have driven hundreds of thousands of miles and have yet to see an &#x2F;r&#x2F;IdiotsInCars moment. I think drivers are better than you think they are. If there are even just 10 recorded idiots a day, then that sub can be active and interesting every single day, but that doesn&#x27;t reflect the fact that there may be  10,000,000 responsible drivers for each of those idiots.<p>&gt; At worst it’s equivalent to the average human driver.<p>So I think this needs to be backed up with actual data and not some anecdotes from Reddit.')
