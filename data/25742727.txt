If you don&#x27;t have any programming background, you can enroll in some coursera or udacity courses to start with. Then go through this course <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;class&#x2F;cs106x&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;class&#x2F;cs106x&#x2F;</a>, the course reader is really good. After that for data engineering read this book <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1449373321" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications...</a>. Also learn some sql. Take some data, feed into sql light db, and ask question and convert question into query.  Becoming good at this takes some time. Be patience. The learning curve is like hokey stick, initial phase might have a dip but it accelerate in the later phase.  BY ANY CHANCE DO NOT JOIN A BOOTCAMP.')
