Stocktwits and few other websites do some good work in signal boosting, up and coming stocks, but sometimes the volume is too low for people to pick it up.<p>Reddit has been a great community for all things financial, so I turned to the OG community, r&#x2F;wallstreetbets to see what are they talking about and make a real time leaderboard out of it.<p>I am using a plain string matching(using a Trie of all stock tickers) with some context of using $ in the comments, so there could be some everyday words that slipped into the list, but the top of them are very obvious($AMC, $GME etc).<p>I also got this domain(stonks.news) last year, planning to build some tools I would personally use over next few months and may be the community would like them too. Appreciate any suggestions or comments on what would you want to see in fintech(charts, alerts about earnings etc).')
