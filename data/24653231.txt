They were probably looking for crimes of a fiscal nature however, which is understandable. Second chances are second chances but security is mostly about trust.<p>Another job at a startup in Germany that worked in less tightly controlled spaces has never asked me to produce my criminal record, nor could they legally. An employer can only ask questions that are reasonably <i>necessary</i> for them to make a fair consideration about me as an applicant. You could ask an accountant about embezzlement convictions, a pharmacist about drug convictions etc., but that is not applicable to software engineers.<p>This is the only sane way to do things.')
