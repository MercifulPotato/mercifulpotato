I&#x27;m both not surprised, but sorry to hear, this experience will result in you leaving your current position. That stress sucks!<p>I think there is a multifactor problem with building a work product that other people in the company don&#x27;t fully appreciate, and without gaining full &quot;buy-in&quot; to take the risks and time investment needed for success.<p>Part of this problem is communication: you need to be your projects own advocate, and communicate clearly how &quot;model performance is X&quot; and for profitability under assumption Y, we need &quot;performance of at least Z given ...&quot;. This could take substantial time, but someone needs to do it, and it&#x27;s the only way to justify the time investment in your model as a necessary business expense. Model training is just not important, where the model is in terms of business application is the only thing you should be communicating to a small team.<p>The other problem, I&#x27;ve found, is that some teams are far less willing or able to understand that the technical challenges of machine learning&#x2F;data science are not quite the same class of problem as software engineering, and the deliver&#x2F;work cycle can be both slower and less determinant. People read this as you not getting stuff done (your fault). The best remedy I&#x27;ve found is just to deliver early and often, which is sounds like you&#x27;ve done.')
