Somehow I don&#x27;t think the original paper is talking about that.<p>Why not?<p>Technically its talking about polynomial sized circuits, but that is roughly the same thing.<p>To quote the paper, the property they are looking for:<p>&quot;(T, γ)-Indistinguishability: For every two ensembles {C_0,λ} {C_1,λ} of polynomial-sized\ncircuits that have the same size, input length, and output length, and are functionally equivalent, that is, ∀λ, C_0,λ(x) = C_1,λ(x) for every input x, the following distributions are (T, γ)-\nindistinguishable: {iO(1^λ, C_0,λ)} {iO(1^λ, C_1,λ)}&quot;')
