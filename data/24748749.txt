Python’s std csv parser is very fast &amp; versatile, perfectly good for a range of use cases that don’t have unusual needs.<p>2. For any production use cases whose needs aren’t met by the std csv parser, nobody would use it and nobody has to - plenty of other options exist (rightfully) as separate packages that allow the user to choose a different point of trade-off properties if they don’t like the std module’s defaults.<p>Nothing says the std isn’t good enough for production - it is. Just most people will use something application-specific and they have tons of options.')
