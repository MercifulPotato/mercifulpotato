Intel literally calls Turbo Boost &quot;algorithmic overclocking&quot;.<p>The problem is this base clock speed is given by the CPU manufacturer not the laptop maker. And Intel wouldn&#x27;t know what kind of laptop it&#x27;s getting crammed into. So careful definitions don&#x27;t really help. Desktops are already big clunky things that have to be kept plugged in, I can trust them a lot more to deliver the CPU&#x27;s promised performance. Whereas laptops are notoriously making compromises because customers tend to be very unrealistic about noise, battery life, etc.')
