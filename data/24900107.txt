Regardless, congratulations to everyone involved!<p>This deal has got me thinking... whether a right way to &quot;lay-off&quot; a supremely talented bunch is to actually see if other companies are willing to offer them jobs? Kind of how player transfers happen in Football (soccer).<p>Either the team goes to the newer company wholesale or you help find your engineers suitable roles elsewhere.<p>One might argue there&#x27;s no advantage to the company laying-off people, but they could save on the severance package, and frankly, two companies entering an understanding like this bodes well on other levels where someone could probably explore a &quot;cross-company&quot; job change with blessings of the employers on both sides of the table.<p>Of course, things like salary negotiations take a hit for the candidate especially, but internal transfers to different teams &#x2F; location in bigger companies already work this way. May be year-end reviews and code can be shared on a need-to-know basis between the companies with employee consent.<p>In particular, such arrangements between smaller &#x2F; crash-strapped companies and bigger &#x2F; well-funded companies might work out for the good. Then again, you never want the bigger company to start poaching wholesale from the smaller one. May be there&#x27;s a balance in here somewhere that can be worked out given enough time and data.')
