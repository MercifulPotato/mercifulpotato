Conversion is then done to whatever local time-keeping system you might have.<p>Leap seconds are based on conditions here on Earth and wouldn&#x27;t really be needed on Mars or Venus. They might have different peculiarities though, and they wouldn&#x27;t be usable on Earth. In that situation, a single point of reference would be useful for conversions.')
