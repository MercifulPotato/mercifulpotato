I&#x27;m suffering on a laptop that &quot;only&quot; has 16GB RAM, and this is despite minimizing the load by alternating between Sway and i3 depending on mood on boot. Editor, Browser (unavoidably heavy, with a ton of tabs open as part of the workflow), PDF viewer, Music player and little else. Everything is bloated these days.<p>I don&#x27;t see how 8GB can be tolerable as a workstation. It really is a deal breaker.')
