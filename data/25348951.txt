Any product that emphasises  on anything beyond that metric is talked down and its users are branded as &quot;uneducated suckers&quot;. It&#x27;s impossible to explain that you want a headphone that looks good, is light, can fold, can connect easily etc.  They are extremists that prey on balanced products and people like those.<p>That&#x27;s why I like what Apple is doing: earphones&#x2F;headphones designed with overall experience in mind.')
