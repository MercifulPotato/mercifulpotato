VSCode can, but VSCode frankly doesn&#x27;t compare.<p>So even before working remotely I started using emacs with lsp-mode. Which is fine because I have been a casual emacs user for 30 years now so my fingers work efficiently in it, and the LSP stuff is fast and competent. It indexes everything I need and has pretty good symbol navigation and even some simple refactorings.<p>(I&#x27;m a paying CLion customer, but JetBrains can&#x27;t seem to get their act together with large code bases. Many years on and the Chromium tree simply can&#x27;t index in it, let alone the tree I work on which is Chromium + an extensive set of internal trees)')
