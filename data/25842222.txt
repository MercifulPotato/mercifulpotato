And just as today, rule-breaking was common.<p>&gt;&quot;Over the year from the summer of 1630 to the summer of 1631, I found something like about 550 different cases that people were prosecuted for, for various infringements of the public health regulations,&quot; says Henderson. For most of that time, the city wasn&#x27;t in full lockdown, but people were expected to self-isolate for 40 days if a member of their household was suspected of having the plague, and taken to hospital. This is where the word &quot;quarantine&quot; comes from â€“ &quot;quaranta giorni&quot; means &quot;40 days&quot; in Italian.<p>Lockdowns like this have continued to be a part in public health approaches to infectious disease around the world.<p>The fact that a majority of Americans, convinced of their exceptionalism in every way, would oppose such an approach doesn&#x27;t mean that it is inherently impossible or nonfunctional.')
