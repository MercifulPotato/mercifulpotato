Developers don&#x27;t WANT bespoke frameworks that lock you into a single ecosystem. We would obviously prefer open standards and specifications supported by multiple vendors. The popularity of frameworks such as Flutter and QT or APIs such as OpenGL and Vulkan prove that. The SDKs Apple chooses to provide are entirely elective on their part and we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that as developers, they deserve to charge us for this.')
