It&#x27;s part of the reason why the Internet Archive exists and its mission keeps expanding (thankfully). This is hardly unique to the Apple Silicon moment, especially as the author&#x27;s concerns largely date back to M64 and PPC days.<p>I&#x27;m certain an open source x86 emulator on ARM will get done (QEMU already?), as these requirements aren&#x27;t specific to Apple Silicon (although will likely accelerate it).<p>But if the author is concerned about PageMaker and old zines, why not run the original in something like SheepSaver that emulates PPC? Surely that port will exist (ARM -&gt; PPC) with no need to run old Intel Mac apps.')
