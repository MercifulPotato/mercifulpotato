They deserve the Nobel Prize for medicine. The people who wrote this article have done shit to help.<p>Where was this &quot;CEPR&quot; group when FITB stock was being shorted and Apple was coming for their throat?<p>I get that Google is doing lots of bad things now. But the one, and only thing you should be looking at if you actually care about that is #AbolishingImaginaryProperty laws. Everything else is either just done for show or complete ignorance.<p>I hate to see FitBit having to deal with this crap. They are literally putting a doctor on everyone&#x27;s wrist (and if you don&#x27;t get why that is the case, you should go get one and do your research). It&#x27;s going to completely change the world.<p>If these people are truly concerned, greatâ€”get their governments to buy FitBit for $10B, don&#x27;t sacrifice our health for your egos.')
