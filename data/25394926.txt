Just because you filmed a video about a crackpot theory DOES NOT give you the <i>right</i> to air it to millions, and never in our history has a person been able to do so.<p>If you want to stand in Times Square holding a sign about your theory, you&#x27;re free to do so. If you want to buy your own TV channel and air it, you&#x27;re free to do so. If you DEMAND some TV network run it, you&#x27;re gunna have a bad time.')
