That&#x27;s coin flipping at that point - basically the same as saying having no information or opinion - all outcomes are equally the same.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more information in this case - that Epstein frequented the world&#x27;s leaders, even had access to American presidents on his private plane without Secret Service, had video recordings of world leaders  having sex with underage women, had professional faked passports issued to him with fake identities.<p>When given a chance to deny communications with intelligence, Acosta refused to do so.<p>I think skepticism is required in all things but not believing anything at all is a dangerous anti-pattern.')
