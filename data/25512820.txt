From a Harvard study entitled &quot;Are CEOs Rewarded for Luck? The Ones Without Principals Are&quot;:<p>&gt; <i>CEOs are rewarded for luck. Moreover, pay for luck is as large as pay for general pay for performance. Pay for luck also appears on the most discretionary components of compensation, salary and bonus. Looking closer, we found that pay for luck is strongest among poorly governed firms. Adding a large shareholder on the board, for example, decreased the pay for luck by 23 to 33 percent. This finding weakens two prominent explanations of pay for luck: “Paying for luck is optimal” and “Filtering out luck is impossible.”</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1162&#x2F;00335530152466269" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1162&#x2F;00335530152466269</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;sendhil&#x2F;files&#x2F;are_ceos_rewarded_for_luck_the_ones_without_principals_are.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;sendhil&#x2F;files&#x2F;are_ceos_rew...</a><p>Another study, &quot;What Makes a Winner? Toward Resolving the Role of Luck and Skill in Sustained CEO Performance&quot;:<p>&gt; <i>This study is an empirical examination of the extent to which luck can explain sustained performance. Using a unique empirical strategy of bootstrap simulations that we compare to actual performances of public companies, we observe that over 95% of the differences in performance outcomes between “top” versus “average” performers can be attributed to luck, even if all CEOs are equally skilled. Through this novel empirical approach, we can better incorporate the role of luck into studies of sustained performance, and our findings suggest that more attention should be placed on the role of unanticipated and even uncontrollable changes on performance.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=2827132" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=2827132</a>')
