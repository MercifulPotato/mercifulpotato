What facts would come to light that&#x27;d make you say, &quot;Oops, my bad!&quot;?</i><p>It&#x27;s difficult for me to conceive of my reaction as an overreaction. I would like to explore that dialogue, but I can&#x27;t get myself into a place to work from. I just can&#x27;t do it.<p><i>Alternatively, if this is allowed to pass, what material differences will come into existence as a result? What predictions will you make about the lasting consequences of this specific action?</i><p>People won&#x27;t know what general purpose computers are. They&#x27;ll accept silly ideas like &quot;Well, my computer just can&#x27;t do that thing anymore.&quot; The full value that computers can bring to individuals and to society won&#x27;t be realized.<p>General purpose computers are a unique invention in human history. I hold the value they bring to humanity in high esteem. I think their ability to affect positive change on the human condition is difficult to understate.<p>I perceive a systematic effort, and a manifest effect brought on by the marketplace, to eliminate access to general purpose computing for individuals and to replace computers with vaguely computer-shaped appliances.<p>We&#x27;re racing headlong into a &quot;The Right to Read&quot; scenario. Feeling that it&#x27;s normal to accept somebody altering your computer because you agreed to a vaguely-worded license agreement stilted heavily in the favor of the software developer isn&#x27;t alright. The more people think that&#x27;s alright the worse things are for everybody.')
