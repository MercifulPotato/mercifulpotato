Which is why Apple does what it can to ameliorate those kinds of labor issues. Those efforts aren&#x27;t perfect, but Apple gives it a shot, at least. Apple isn&#x27;t in a position to tell Wistron or Foxconn or anyone else exactly how to run their business. All Apple can do is measures like putting a supplier on probation until issues are addressed (like with Wistron lately), or (limited) wage demands, or threats to choose another supplier next time. But there are a very limited number of suppliers that can realistically fill demand, and none of them are paying $40&#x2F;hour and building charter schools and condos for employees.')
