And its 8-bit architecture would be quickly eclipsed by 8086 and 68000-based machines, so it was both state of the art and outdated at the same time.<p>Apple was right in that they needed a machine that was significantly more powerful than the Apple II, but their timing was off and the architecture was wrong.  The IBM PC did a much better job of hitting the sweet spot of price vs. power vs. complexity.')
