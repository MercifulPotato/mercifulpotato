But:<p>Why would Biden&#x27;s certification be a cue or trigger for left violence?  That&#x27;s the part of what you said that makes no sense to me.<p>I mean, if Trump managed to remain president somehow, I could see the left going absolutely insane with violence (and with reason).  But why when Biden makes it in?<p>And if you mean that the left is going to continue in violence even after Biden is certified, that&#x27;s probably true.  Some of them are going to be violent until the entire system is overthrown and everyone gets a puppy.  But it sounded like you were saying that Biden being certified was going to be the <i>start</i> of a bunch of left violence, and I can&#x27;t understand why.')
