I argue that the public putting pressure on individuals who spread bad ideas to stop doing that<p>The whole point is that there&#x27;s not a good way to determine what ideas are &quot;bad ideas&quot; apart from ongoing public debate.<p>&gt; up to and including the employer terminating that employment relationship---is part of the healthy public immune system to bad ideas and antisocial behavior<p>The obvious problem is that &quot;employers can terminate any employee at will&quot; is that it does at least as much harm to &quot;good ideas&quot; as to &quot;bad ideas&quot;. It optimizes for &quot;popular ideas&quot; and your ideas might not be popular, <i>especially</i> if you believe (as many cancel culture proponents do) that we live in an abhorrent white supremacist, rape culture. If these ideas are indeed popular, then a mechanism that allows employers to terminate employees for any reason coupled with an incentive system that encourages employers to terminate employees with unpopular ideas will naturally result in the propagation of those popular ideals.')
