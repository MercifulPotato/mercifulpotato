This automatically suggests some ties to government, as it&#x27;s the best way to fulfill the criterion of impact. Not sure how to handle the &quot;swift&quot; part, though. Can&#x27;t do it through regular market mechanisms, because ultimately price trumps all on mass market. The government reacts slowly for (among others) a good reason - while an unscrupulous businessman needs to invent just one weird trick, the government regulates away whole classes of tricks by default, and they need to take care to not outlaw perfectly legit new ideas.')
