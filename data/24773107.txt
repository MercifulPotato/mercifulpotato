The speaker is speaking in a more formal register in her Mandarin samples than in her Shanghainese samples which causes greater vocabulary and structural differences than if they were at the same register. In fact I&#x27;m a little surprised she doesn&#x27;t use exact analogs when translating between the two, e.g. 搿就是讲 -&gt; 这就是说 instead of her choice of 这意味着, 越来越结棍了 -&gt; 越来越历害了 instead of her choice of 愈演愈烈, and 开始寻被偷脱个物事了 -&gt; 开始找被偷掉的东西了 instead of her choice of 开始找被偷物品了, since it is both a more accurate translation and reflects the structural similarity of the two sentences much better (there is a one-to-one correspondence between each word of both sentences).<p>Regardless I certainly would not view Shanghainese as mutually intelligible with Mandarin.')
