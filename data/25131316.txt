Item(by='m-i-l', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605655872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127371, text='Its still pretty new and I&#x27;m working on it in my spare time, but my side-project <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchmysite.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchmysite.net&#x2F;</a> seems pretty close to what the author is after:<p>- &quot;100% of the software would be free software, and third parties would be encouraged to set up their own installations&quot; - I&#x27;m planning on open sourcing it under AGPL soon, once I&#x27;ve got documentation, testing etc. ready. Plus it&#x27;s easy to set up your own installation (git clone; mkdirs for data; docker-compose up -d).<p>- &quot;I would not have it crawling the entire web from the outset&quot; - That&#x27;s one of the key features of my approach, only crawling submitted domains. I&#x27;m focussing on personal websites and independent websites at the moment, primarily because I don&#x27;t currently have the money for infra to crawl big but useful sites like wikipedia, but there&#x27;s nothing to stop people setting up their own instances for other types of site.<p>- &quot;whoâ€™s going to pay for it? Advertisements or paid results are not going to fly&quot; - A tough anti-advert stance is another key differentiating feature to try to keep out spam, e.g. I detect adverts on indexed pages and make sure those pages are heavily downranked. Planning to pay running costs via a listing fee, which gives access to additional features like greater control over indexing (e.g. being able to trigger reindexing on demand).')
