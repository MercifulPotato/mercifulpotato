Item(by='auganov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608061231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429114, text='&gt; The law applies to any service targeted at EU citizens. It does not apply to services that any EU citizen happens to be using even though they&#x27;re primarily intended for citizens of other countries.<p>&gt; A &quot;local&quot; Bavarian news site hosted in the US would be in scope, but a local Nebraskan news site hosted in the US wouldn&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty optimistic interpretation of this recital. It doesn&#x27;t talk about who is <i>primarily</i> being targeted, but the mere intent (or possibility) of &quot;offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union&quot;. If all local EU news websites are covered because they&#x27;re offering a service just by being a news website, then it follows that US sites are offering a service too. The only remaining part is to prove intent. Most of these local US sites blocking the EU are operated by big players like MNI targeted media and Chicago Tribune publishing. Even 1% of the traffic being from the EU would be a big number.<p>Conversely, if this would indeed exempt them from GDPR, then are all general purpose US news sites not specifically targeting the EU exempt too? Or let&#x27;s go further, if I have a social media site and 99% of my users are Americans talking about US-related stuff, am I exempt too even if I let EU citizens register and participate?')
