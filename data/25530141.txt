This, along with transmission ratios, trades off against other things people often want in their cars.<p>hp above 300ish is mostly about what happens (or doesn&#x27;t happen) at triple digit speeds, at least for regular passenger vehicles not towing large loads.  The latter is all about torque available at what range but that can push you into higher hp territory.')
