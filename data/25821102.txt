Blue Origin is interested in big rockets and sub orbital. SpaceX doesn&#x27;t even play the same sport.<p>Virgin Orbit has an interesting concept but they have invested gigantic amounts of money compared to their small launch competition. Its hard for me to see how they would ever be profitable.<p>Getting to Orbit is hard, but as RocketLab learned, going from there to mass production and costumer payload integration is very challenging. That said, VO already has way more people then RocketLab did when the company reached Orbit.')
