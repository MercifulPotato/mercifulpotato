This entire thing has literally scared you into not fulfilling the genetic imperative, ending your own genetic line because you think that perhaps you may have an easier, simpler life and death this way. No need to expose yourself to the suffering of others you love, no need to invest yourself in tomorrow - just watch it all go, knowing that when you inevitably shuffle off the coil nobody is going to mind a bit.<p>Sad. Sorry to hear it. It&#x27;s always a shame when an intelligent person chooses to ignore the sacrifice every one of their ancestors made to bring them to this point, just so that they don&#x27;t have to risk the potential of having any hardship themselves. I do sincerely hope that you accomplish something great in your life that makes it otherwise worthwhile for them; to know that generations of people eked by just for you to play video games all day would be a truly disappointing conclusion.')
