I&#x27;m a jack of all trades, so I fill in the gaps within my team.<p>About as much of my job is about ensuring everyone else on the team is able to be their most productive, as it is applying my skills and experience to a project of my own.  Sometimes that means working with engineers in my team directly on stuff, or acting as a sounding board.  Other times that&#x27;s getting involved in certain meetings to be able to present a more detailed technical response, and potentially head things off at the pass.  As I&#x27;ve learned to take a step back from things, I can see just how much my influence has effect within the group.<p>I do still love getting my hands dirty, I love solving problems.  I&#x27;ve no intention of ever stepping away from that kind of work.  I don&#x27;t really have to, either, even with the seniority.')
