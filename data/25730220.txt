After all what you did, essentially, was utter some words. (The bomb might never have existed).<p>What if the government passed a law to the effect of &quot;you can&#x27;t say the banking system is vile and corrupt because it may encourage people to rob banks&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s a slippery slope of sorts, and a line should be drawn, preferably grounded in some logical principle. I don&#x27;t have a good answer off the top of my head; just food for thought.')
