There are kernel people who maintain the kernel and there are Debian devs who maintain the operating system. The server may be mine (but more often that not, it isn&#x27;t) but only in very specific circumstances do I ever concern myself with maintaining any part of this stack.<p>A vanilla Linux VM is a platform to build on. Just like AWS or anything else. It is the environment in which my software runs.<p>Thus far, something like Debian has been more stable and much less of a moving target than any proprietary platform has been, cloud or non-cloud. Should a client wish to minimize maintenance costs of the software over the coming decade, it is most cost effective to not depend on specialized, proprietary, platform components.<p>That may change in the future, but right now there is no indication that is the case.')
