Any other guitar, is just a guitar. There are cars, boats, houses, ect that have this same effect of carrying a higher meaning.<p>Buildings have a connection to the landscape around them. Something aesthetically pleasing in architecture works in harmony with the nature&#x2F;city surrounding it. Many buildings are an eyesore because they do not fit into their surroundings. Many of the british Edwardian masterpieces didn&#x27;t work when recreated in australia. Parthenon works on it&#x27;s original landscape.<p>The techniques that go into building them have a relevance to the society around them. A cathedral can be a 300yr construction cycle as a testament to entirely new building techniques like a domed roof. The first building to carry that maintains the meaning of a step forward for humanity. Subsequent buildings don&#x27;t carry that meaning. Building a cathedral now with a domed roof takes like a year and is cheap, commonplace and uninteresting. The Parthenon&#x27;s warped foundation to trick you into thinking it&#x27;s a straight building is not an necessary technique any more, though amazing for that time period.<p>Museums in britian that contain all the dead art to ever be considered worth preserving tried to charge an entry fee (gold coin donation, 2015ish) instead of being free to the public and admission dropped by 25%. The value of preservation is quite low.<p>Texas is not the birthplace of democracy, and it is not interesting spamming out parthenons with modern tooling. The excess of modern perfection completely minimizes the original achievement, all you are preserving is the recipe-book for building that particular pattern of concrete. The only spirit a faux-parthenon in texas carries is crass commercial reproduction of long-passed european greats. Like a plastic Disney castle vaguely imitates european castles, a parthenon in Texas is a pointless attempt at claiming something the state didn&#x27;t earn and can&#x27;t own by definition.<p>Make something that is unique and special that could only be made in Texas. There are unique set of materials, landscape, people, social culture and attitudes, desires of what needs to be expressed in the culture. We only have one Texas, it needs to be Texan and not faux-greece. Any given patch of land yearns for it&#x27;s own self-expression. I can&#x27;t see any other way of building, nor the virtue in dropping foreign works from a great height into an empty landscape.')
