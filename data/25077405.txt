Apple marketing just doesn&#x27;t want you to call Rosetta2 an emulator because &quot;emulators are slow&quot;. Anything running software on a different architecture is an emulator.<p>If you read my parent comment you&#x27;ll see how DAWs are going to be using Rosetta2 for years to come, maybe even a decade, for many people. Even if there are ARM versions, you won&#x27;t be able to use them until <i>all</i> your dozens if not hundreds of plug-ins, some of which won&#x27;t be actively developed any more or will require a re-purchase for an ARM version, have also migrated.<p>People invested in such ecosystems aren&#x27;t just going to up and give up half their collection of software, or spend thousands re-purchasing upgrades to get ARM versions.')
