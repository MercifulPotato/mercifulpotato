I figured that it wasn&#x27;t going to work out when the guy we talked to took us to a conference room that looked too nice, and admitted that he hadn&#x27;t been on the production floor in the next building before me and my buddy asked to go check that out.<p>We took the job anyway because it looked interesting, started doing the preliminaries, and when we went to get the test panels a couple weeks later, a FBI lady shooed us away from the parking lot as they were taping the building up.<p>Very weird.')
