I spend as little as possible. No electronics, clothing, etc. unless it must be replaced. I’m still using a 2013 MacBook Pro I got at a previous job. I only own two pairs of shorts, a few T-shirts, and a pair of flip flops. No video game console, smart speakers, microwave, Apple TV, or whatever.<p>My free time is spent on things that mostly don’t cost money. E-books are free, so are TV, movies, and music as they are easily pirated. I don’t spend money on games, as there are thousands of old games available for free using emulators.<p>Walking is free, biking is free, gardening and many sports can be free, spending time with friends and loved ones is free.')
