They&#x27;ve managed to ruin even the amazing Pixel phones with poor hardware and poor decisions on pricing and availability. I have a Pixel 2XL and desperately want to upgrade but I can&#x27;t because both Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 are not available in India! I&#x27;ve been waiting to buy a good non-Apple smartwatch for years now but I can&#x27;t wait anymore. I prefer Android over iOS, but the current affair of things is making me give up and just go for iPhone and Apple Watch.')
