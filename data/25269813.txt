Something is a bit rotten though because I&#x27;d guess about half of us burned out of academia entirely, and the state of the art at the time was regrettable. I remember one model doing rather well except the weights of the various physical forces were wrong, so much that some signs were negative and what should have been electrostatic repulsion was actually electrostatic attraction between similar charges. This was 10 years ago of course, but all of the field improvements were relatively incremental and small until AlphaFold came along.<p>Modern academia exists to further modern academia, no more and no less. I became disillusioned of any search for truth and progress during my time there, it was really just about showing up the Baker lab at the next CASP and getting the next round of grants secured.')
