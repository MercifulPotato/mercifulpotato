Item(by='timbit42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606682035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246934, text='The Amiga was somewhat popular in the US but I think it was mostly with people who had Commodore 8-bit systems and remained with Commodore when upgrading to 16-bit systems. There were a lot of Atari and Apple II systems in the US besides the C64 and Atari and Apple II owners likely upgraded to Apple Macs, the Atari ST and IBM PCs and not the Amigas. Beyond home computing, the Amiga got quite a bit of use in the video industry in the US.<p>In contrast, Commodore systems were huge in Canada, where I live. All the schools here had 8-bit Commodore systems from the PET to the C64 era. This meant a lot of homes had the VIC-20 and C64. I only knew 1 person in my school with an Apple II and one with an Atari 800XL. Many of the Commodore owners upgraded to Amigas, especially once the Amiga 500 came out. Of course, Canada had 1&#x2F;10th the population so there weren&#x27;t as many Amigas as in the US, but a higher percentage of the population had them.')
