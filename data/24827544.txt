But unfortunately I&#x27;m in a messy situation in terms of nationality right now. And the chance of attending local universities is quite improbable due to my current circumstances.<p>I&#x27;m planning to save up to go to schools in EU. At the moment I&#x27;m looking at Germany, which appears to have more relaxed rules for high school reports for none-EU students.. And even then I hope I don&#x27;t get stuck in some kafkaesque bureaucracy.<p>And yup so at the same time I&#x27;m exploring for alternatives.
