Item(by='djsumdog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607015680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291054, text='&gt; President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to reinstate DACA<p>DACA is an act that cannot be repealed because it grants &quot;Equitable Entitlements.&quot; It&#x27;s very similar to the Emancipation Proclamation. If a president after Lincoln wanted to overturn it, they certainly could try (at least until the 13th Amendment was ratified), but it would hit a legal burden because you&#x27;d now be taking away rights. You could even argue it&#x27;d be taking away &quot;unalienable rights.&quot;<p>The same goes with DACA. The government cannot say, &quot;give us your name and address and we won&#x27;t deport you&quot; and then, with a late president, then deport you after granting those rights.<p>I do not like DACA. If America needs more unskilled workers, the immigration system should be reformed to let them in legally, via similar processes to H1-Bs. Currently only a few thousand are let in legally as unskilled from South and Central America. I&#x27;ve gone through immigration before in other countries, and it takes background checks, medical checks, and several other things that ensure a baseline identity for people coming in.<p>You can argue we didn&#x27;t need this 200 years ago, but the previous world without documented citizens, passports and immigration also contained a world with a larger slave trade, larger inequity, the spreading of invasive species, etc. Some socialite changes are good.<p>I understand things are bad for undocumented workers, but they, or their parents, made the decision to come in illegally.<p>DACA is a Pandora&#x27;s Box when it comes to executive powers. It would be different if Congress passed this, but they didn&#x27;t. Granting more powers to the executive is going to bite the US government in the ass at some point.')
