Charge $9&#x2F;mo or something ridiculously low and encourage everyone to check their health often and maintain healthy lifestyles?<p>Use automation to reduce costs. Then gradually increase the scope of care.<p>That won&#x27;t help with surgery, cancer, childbirth, etc. right away, but it might create a gravitational shift that puts swaths of expensive general practitioners out of business, creating excess supply and lowering the range of what insurance covers. That might greatly reduce costs.<p>We have to eat away at this bloated, inaccessible system somehow.')
