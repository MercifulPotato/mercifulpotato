This headline was based on a neuroimaging experiment, which, predictably, didn&#x27;t prove anything of the kind. Yawn. I&#x27;ve written about this kind of thing before, and no doubt I will do again. But why do I do it? What&#x27;s the harm in this kind of thing?<p>A cynic might say that this kind of thing is harmless fun - or at any rate, harmless. No-one really cares about articles like this, and no-one takes them seriously. No-one&#x27;s going to read this article and start to think that all women are impulsive and gluttonous - at least not unless they were a sexist pig to begin with.[..]<p>if &#x27;neuroskeptic&#x27; is going to disown Nature Neuroscience like he is doing with a Daily Mail article, then we certainly dont have anything to discuss here anymore.<p>*<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nature_Research" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nature_Research</a>')
