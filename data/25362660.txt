There were contacts with Russians from both the DNC and RNP, but once again:<p>&gt; a lack of sufficient evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin to impact the outcome of the 2016 election.<p>Lack of evidence that Trump conspired. There is no collusion.<p>Thanks for proving my point with your source.')
