Most small businesses just need to pre-aggregate their metrics and feed them into a DW&#x2F;OLAP system. Then you can just have a software engineer build an API and some visualisations around the metrics.<p>From personal experience working on Fortune 500 projects, the challenge is actually defining the metrics, hierarchies and dimensions. You have to understand the business well, and also be technical to understand how it translates into a data warehouse.<p>I just started the coursera specialization on data warehousing [1]. While I do have some exposure to dimensional models and hierarchies, I think this will be an awesome experience to build a data warehouse myself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;specializations&#x2F;data-warehousing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;specializations&#x2F;data-warehousing</a>')
