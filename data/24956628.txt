Just looking at .NET, because I&#x27;m familiar with it and traditionally desktop software has been a big area of concern for it, Windows Forms will work for forever but hasn&#x27;t been touched in a long time, WPF has some sharp edges that make it feel unfinished but isn&#x27;t being touched, and WinRT was basically stillborn because of their attempts to tie it in with the whole &quot;new&quot; Windows 8 ecosystem.  Meanwhile, browsers are getting new capabilities constantly.  It&#x27;s hard to blame anyone who looks at that mess and says to hell with it and goes with a Web browser-based solution.')
