There&#x27;s no <i>one</i> true narrative.<p>And my point with choosing a THAT narrative was to put the headline into a positive light: More money towards kids games than military tech! Hooray!<p>Apart from that, there&#x27;s of course a very logical argument too. Which is that a digital economy like Roblox is a novelty. That means it&#x27;s difficult to evaluate and often it&#x27;s evaluated by its potential.<p>The economics for robots on the other hand are drastically different. They&#x27;ll have to be researched, developed, built, and maintained. Whereas for any software: You write it once and copy it for &quot;free&quot; to as many customers as you want.<p>Anyways, anyone is free to pick and chose their narrative according to their liking.')
