Over the two years they saved, this is about the salary for 100 engineers. Can you replace and maintain all the cloud aspects that AWS provides you with (I mean the ones you actually use) with 100 engineers? Maybe, if they are good engineers (which is kinda implied by the 300k salary tag in the calculation). If it&#x27;s worth it, remains to be seen. Definitely nothing for any medium sized company.<p>Dropbox is huge and has a relatively simple, highly optimized use-case, for which cloud perhaps doesn&#x27;t offer too much. This is NOT the norm. For most companies, no matter the size, building their own cloud is a no go.<p>&gt;  those features are killed off and vanish from the face of the earth?<p>Don&#x27;t use Google Cloud then ;).<p>&gt; but if we consider the absurd premium charged by cloud providers for their services...<p>Do you have any data on backing this up? This &quot;absurd premium&quot; includes the salaries of engineers to develop it, maintain it, do DevOps, keep the hardware&#x2F;data centers, do marketing, etc. etc. There is of course a margin, these companies aren&#x27;t doing it as a social service... That margin is highly variable from service to service and also between cloud providers. Some may not have a margin at all, others may run at a loss. There is not easy &quot;uh everything is overpriced&quot;. Most companies will have a VERY hard time providing the offering at the price of large cloud providers. And the simple &quot;back of the envelope&quot; calculations often miss all the work &amp; cost that needs to be done, but you don&#x27;t know about...<p>&gt; Well, those &quot;others&quot; doing the work can be employed by your company and you still save money.<p>Yeah, if your company is really big, then yes. If your revenue is below 100 million, there isn&#x27;t even room for any discussion on this: Don&#x27;t run your own cloud, it&#x27;s not gonna work. Most of the &quot;cons&quot; I see are about misunderstandings of the offerings and failure to navigate the pricing models and picking the cheapest offerings that do the job. If you fail to do even that, how on earth are you going to run your own cloud?')
