Over the two years they saved, this is about the salary for 100 engineers. Can you replace and maintain all the cloud aspects that AWS provides you with (I mean the ones you actually use) with 100 engineers? Maybe, if they are good engineers (which is kinda implied by the 300k salary tag in the calculation). If it&#x27;s worth it, remains to be seen. Definitely nothing for any medium sized company.<p>Dropbox is huge and has a relatively simple, highly optimized use-case, for which cloud perhaps doesn&#x27;t offer too much. This is NOT the norm. For most companies, no matter the size, building their own cloud is a no go.<p>&gt;  those features are killed off and vanish from the face of the earth?<p>Don&#x27;t use Google Cloud then ;).')
