Agencies that do rulemaking have to provide justification for why they&#x27;re enacting or repealing particular regulations, otherwise those regulations can be struck down as capricious. This is a major problem the Trump administration had: a lot of their attempts to rollback Obama&#x27;s policies or enact new ones foundered on the ability to provide this justification.')
