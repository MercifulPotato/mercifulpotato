I can imagine folks being treated differently in Eng vs CX at other companies, and have seen that. I have trouble imagining that at CB, but anything&#x27;s possible.<p>CB stands out in my career for the number of good human beings I&#x27;ve gotten to meet and work with. And my read when I see Brian, Emilie, Surojit, and Manish speak at weekly AMAs is they genuinely care about everyone in the company. It&#x27;s a gut instinct, and so far I have no personal experience or anecdotal from within my circles to the contrary.<p>My sister used to work in CX (outside of tech) and it was really damaging work for her. It&#x27;d be devastating for me to learn our folks are not supported.')
