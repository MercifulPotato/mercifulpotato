When CQEs get added, write to the fd, it just happens to all be in-process.<p>I must admit I haven&#x27;t gone deep into the liburing internals or the low-level io_uring API, but conceptually speaking there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything happening that can&#x27;t be done in-process in userspace atop pthreads for the blocking syscalls.  It just won&#x27;t be fast.<p>Am I missing some critical show-stopping detail?')
