I don&#x27;t have personal insight into how true that is.<p>As an individual, I really don&#x27;t like having monopolies in ads, especially ones that _also_ have monopolies on personal data (FB and Google know everyone I talk to, everywhere I go, etc - yikes). But as a business, I really like the idea of having one platform to buy ads that can put them everywhere, and do a good job deciding where to show them.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution is but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen it proposed anywhere yet. It&#x27;s hard.')
