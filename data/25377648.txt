Mostly A political decision made by people who has a say in spendings of to much money.<p>Cent OS seamed like a bad idea from the start. It does not fill the political reason that allows for redhat. And it does not fill the checkboxes for what a modern independent developer would want.<p>Maybe I am naive but I can’t see any reason for 1 not caring about the OS and some type of container or “server less” service or just using Ubuntu.
