Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=[25723966], score=None, time=1610332908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25723341, text='While I agree - I reckon it&#x27;s far past time that we pierce the outdated &quot;corporate personhood&quot; idea, and let Tesla&#x2F;Uber&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Waymo et al. know that society has chosen to hold their &quot;corporate personhood&quot; responsible in the same way people are held responsible.<p>If your corporation (via it&#x27;s self driving software) kills someone, the corporation will &quot;go to jail&quot;, a C level exec does the jailtime and the entire company will be unable to carry on any of it&#x27;s normal business for the duration of the sentence (while still being held responsible for it&#x27;s obligations to staff&#x2F;suppliers&#x2F;cerditors). If that self driving software is judged to be liable for a traffic infringement, the corporation will pay an amount equal to the percentage of income that a human driver would have paid. If it&#x27;s an infringement with a ~$400 fine, the corporation should pay ~0.5% of their annual income - the same sort of penalty as &quot;an average salary&quot; person.<p>A couple of $20mil fines and a 6 month total company shutdown would be very &quot;proactive&quot; in encouraging Tesla to get Elon to shut the fuck up with his big bold claims that cannot be backed up. If Uber had been slapped with the &quot;corporate personhood&quot; equivalent of whatever penalty a human driver who&#x27;d killed that person crossing the road with a bicycle they&#x27;d be far more circumspect about using minimum wage contractors as &quot;safety drivers&quot; in their prototypes.<p>(I can dream, right?)')
