That&#x27;s 7%!<p>&quot;Sinister&quot; implies intentionally evil-doing, which is something only advanced primates are capable of (maybe corvids and some other mammals, not sure).<p>It&#x27;s not even the most creepy&#x2F;disconcerting kill mechanism. Apart from competitors like the Komodowaran (bites you and then stalks you for days while you are slowly dying from the cocktail of bacteria in its mouth), what about stuff like viruses? They don&#x27;t even <i>live</i>, yet they are highly effective in an evolutional sense and very good at killing lots of stuff in lots of disgusting ways.<p>If you have a phobia of snakes, ok, but please refrain from turning that into some pseudo-intellectual wisdom...')
