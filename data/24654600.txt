I said &quot;it was not universal or common&quot;.<p>Social media is often used to amplify a message, do not act shocked when it amplifies the response as well.<p>I am not sure what the Portugal drug model has to do with this topic or why you&#x27;re pivoting away from murderers and to drug users. You specifically noted murderers(effectively the most heinous of crimes), as gaining more sympathy than racist tweeters. This &quot;sympathy&quot; being provided to these murderers is them rotting in a prison for the rest of their lives or being executed. Social media and &quot;cancel culture&quot; is not on the same level as being stuffed in a prison for the rest of your life or getting a lethal injection. That was my point, not that racist speech on twitter is an automatic crime(though keep in mind that free speech laws do not actually cover all forms of speech).<p>How do you rehabilitate a racist tweeter in a thoughtful and caring manner that doesn&#x27;t alienate their sensibilities? For all the talk of toxic &quot;cancel culture&quot;, ingrained racism is also extremely toxic, and should not simply be ignored.')
