I remember reading Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians and later The Kane Chronicles and The Heroes of Olympus.<p>From personal experience, Rick Riordan&#x27;s series had similar interest levels between girls and boys but later series (Hunger Games, House of Night, Fault in Our Stars) did skew towards girls. My reading also fell off as I got older so I&#x27;m sure I wasn&#x27;t as in touch with what my peers were reading.')
