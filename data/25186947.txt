The two things are quite different. How vaccines work and how COVID works are apples and oranges. Do vaccines have potential side effects? Yes. And of course we don&#x27;t know them. But let&#x27;s be honest...most of us regular people aren&#x27;t getting any of these for quite some time. They are going to go to people on the front line and most at risk first.<p>If you&#x27;re a front line worker, like a doctor or nurse in a hospital, your chances of getting real COVID with real damage are very high. The long term effects of that are known to be bad. So any long terms effects of the vaccine are more than likely to be way way less dangerous. Also vaccine is, so far, not lethal which makes it a way better option.<p>Eventually we, the general population, will learn more about these potential side effects of the vaccines and start to gain access to said vaccines. Until then let&#x27;s not go all anti-vaxxer and pretend we think vaccines give you autism.')
