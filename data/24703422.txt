If you&#x27;re going to suggest that you would wait and &quot;live somewhere else&quot;, I would point out that people who are trying to hire, for example, nurses, often don&#x27;t have that luxury. If they wait 4 years, they&#x27;ll be dead.<p>No one is suggesting that high skill work status are used for people with no training or experience; they explicitly require training and&#x2F;or experience in order to qualify. If think you&#x27;re proving my point; if you need to hire someone right now, and there is no one available locally to do it right now, then there is a shortage, and you need to look outside of your local market.')
