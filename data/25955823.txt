I cook a salt-free cuisine for my relative [1] who has kidney disease and must aggressively control their blood pressure and I can go entire months without eating anything with any salt at all. There was a bit of an adjustment to be had in the first few months, from what I recall, but I was surprised to what degree my taste buds adjusted after a while. Nowadays, I can&#x27;t enjoy normally salted food because it registers as very salty. I have particular trouble with cheeses, even cheese like feta or camembert that only have about 1.5 - 2% salt.<p>Speaking of cheese and bread, most of the internet will say it&#x27;s impossible, but I&#x27;ve found some evidence online (reddit threads and blog posts and the like) of people who actually make both bread <i>and cheese</i> without salt at all (because of hypertension) and they seemed to be doing fine. This was about half a year ago so I can&#x27;t find the sources again, but in any case salt-free cheese and bread making is possible. I&#x27;ve made a few loaves of bread without salt myself and they&#x27;re OK, though they taste a lot better when they&#x27;re made wth sourdough (which is a pain to maintain) rather than dried yeast, because the sourdough adds taste and the dried yeast only air!<p>What&#x27;s the problem with butter? I can find both salt-free and salt-full in most countries in the EU that I&#x27;ve visited.<p>_______<p>[1] well... I cook for the entire household :)')
