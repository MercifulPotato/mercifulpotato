To demo this attack, they wrote a flappy bird clone which was played using the number pad of the mPOS device. It weighed in at ~4k though, so positively heavyweight compared to this!<p>I wouldn&#x27;t knock that achievement: this implementation is 228 byte of Javascript and I&#x27;m guessing that was 4k bytes of binary that only had access to a less-featureful standard library.  You really should add the size of the JS runtime this implementation needs to make the comparison fair.  Otherwise, I could blow you all out of the water with my 11 byte implementation:<p><pre><code>    runFlappy()\n</code></pre>\n(...which runs in FlappyLang, which includes a Flappy Bird implementation in the standard library.)')
