It was founded as an alternative to the social media companies that are de-platforming right wing voices.  That doesn&#x27;t mean more than a tiny percentage on Parler are &quot;supportive of people being killed&quot;.  Actually I&#x27;d like to see some examples - have not yet seen anyone there advocate for violence.  Parler actually does remove such postings so if you see something, report it.')
