A code of conduct should be a measure of last resort.  In your example:<p>&gt; a functioning code of conduct should make the difference between someone saying “I don’t understand why anyone would believe X”, which is an open statement that invites thoughtful discussion, versus “X is stupid and anyone who believes it is an idiot”, which is a closed statement that triggers fighting instead.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the code of conduct should be invoked the first time someone steps a bit onto the side of expressing something in a hostile way.  When collages are in the process of solving real problems, and getting real work done, it can be the case that disagreements occasionally get heated.  If someone steps a bit over the line in terms of how they express themselves in such a disagreement, the first response should be for a colleague to put the metaphorical hand on the shoulder and invite the offender to reign it in a bit, equal-to-equal, rather than invoking the authority of the CoC right away.  If someone repeatedly demonstrates abusive behavior, then it makes sense to escalate this to a matter of community governance.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not ideal if people express themselves in a hurtful or inflammatory way, but if everyone is self-censoring for fear of punishment, it can negatively affect the quality of work that gets done.')
