Giving people a voice. People don&#x27;t feel a sense of belonging because they a single individual amongst thousands&#x2F;millions. Being able to discuss things directly on a map with other citizens is empowering.<p>2. Serving as a spatial knowledge base. Allows users to collaboratively catalog the best, worst, most interesting etc. parts and elements. For example all items tagged with cycling in Waterloo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plantogether.city&#x2F;tag&#x2F;cycling?area_id=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plantogether.city&#x2F;tag&#x2F;cycling?area_id=3</a>).<p>Having more organized information and discussions could go a long way in improving decision making.')
