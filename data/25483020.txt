Security isn&#x27;t as simple as number of lines of code. You need actual in depth analysis to even know the attack surface.<p>The reason why people view wasm as more secure is the runtimes used for it are VM&#x27;s that control execution at an instruction level along with the wasm instruction set being  far simpler than x86. Not saying wasm is magically secure because of this, there&#x27;s not much actual security analysis of existing runtimes - but there are good reasons for why it can be viewed as more secure.')
