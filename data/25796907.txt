I imagine that’s why there are so many homegrown solutions. For me, keeping knowledge is really important and I value this as more important than being able to easily share and integrate information with others (something I almost never do). But if there’s a market for recipe clubs or whatnot that might be really important.<p>I think this is the difference between independent mental models and shared mental models. Where for a wiki, a group needs to agree on a shared mental model and work together. For note taking, I don’t want to preemptively think in a common model so that I can easily share 1% of my thoughts.<p>I do this currently by keeping a bunch of markdown files in gdrive and sending links to particular items when I want to. The link is never stale and changes are visible immediately, and I can even grant edit permissions. AND I can port that to any file system that ever existed or will ever exist through dragging and dropping. I can even keep the same files synced into gdrive&#x2F;Dropbox. Of course when I port, all the links die.')
