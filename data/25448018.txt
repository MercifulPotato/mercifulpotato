The reasons are similar to the contempt held for people who decry the manipulation of public opinion, while our high-aptitude graduates decide to work for advertisement companies in the Bay Area in chase of the Almighty Dollar. It is sexy and high status, until more people consider the utility (or disutility) that these people bring to society. It sounds like the author is really lamenting a loss of status.<p>I recall a seminar given a few years back by an astronomy PhD graduate who was talking about career prospects outside of academia, and naturally all of them were &#x27;data science&#x27; related. The speaker&#x27;s first remark was something like &#x27;I don&#x27;t mean to say that data science is just marketing, but...&#x27; and then proceed to describe their career as a person &#x27;with statistics and scripting experience&#x27;... working in marketing.<p>In journalism, it is said that you can always find employment if you join the dark side, which is public relations. I think less people fool theirself in thinking that PR serves the public interest.<p>We can speculate about why we are hemorrhaging scientists to marketeers, but for the self-interested individual, it&#x27;s rational. I&#x27;ve always thought that teachers and scientists do not have as high status as they should for the contributions that they provide to society, but perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t want to attract people to those fields who are in it for the riches and glory.[†]<p>[†] (of course, it&#x27;s more nuanced than this)')
