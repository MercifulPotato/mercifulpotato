I have concerns about Beam&#x2F;Dataflow, but they seem different to yours.<p>The dataflow product seems to run older versions of Apache Beam just fine, so minor deprecations don’t seem like an issue in practice, but maybe I’m mistaken.<p>“No visible contributions to Apache BEAM itself”. I don’t think this is true, I’m a contributor and somewhat active on the developer mailing list, it seems the majority of the contributions these days come from google employees.<p>If the questionnaire you’re referring to was the paid Apache Beam survey, I participated and definitely didn’t get the impression that they were considering deprecating the service. It was much more focused on how they can improve docs, examples, and help developers use it.<p>Now, <i>I</i> think the project is too ambitious even for google.  They don’t need to support Spark&#x2F;Dataflow&#x2F;Flink on three different languages (java&#x2F;python&#x2F;go) imo. I’m also frustrated with some of the bugs that slip through.<p>The fact that there is no back pressure support for a streaming framework is <i>such</i> a google thing to do: why worry about back pressure if you can just tell another team to increase their throughput for downstream sinks? &#x2F;s<p>Dataflow does seem to be one of GCP’s most popular services (spotify and twitter are both users now) so I would guess it is here to stay in some form.')
