A patch in a series should only depend on its predecessors. You can submit more than one patch in a pull request.<p>I would never send out a patch set for review that includes all the &quot;oops&quot; &quot;typo&quot; &quot;iteration 50&quot; etc. commits I make as I work on code. Those are pure noise.<p>However, git is a tool for development, and during development I should be able to use git in whichever way is convenient <i>for me</i>: commit, rewrite and do whatever the hell I want with my local history. Not having that freedom is the primary reason why working with most non-distributed version control systems is such a pain.<p>When it comes to actually merging patch series to master, I like not doing fast-forward merges, since you maintain a natural grouping of the applied changes.')
