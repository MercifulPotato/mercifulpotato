Most commonly cited figure and the basis for most extrapolation is 200 million. However that&#x27;s still a lot. To put it in perspective:<p>&quot;The current global estimate is that there were around 272 million international migrants in the world in 2019, which equates to 3.5 per cent of the global population&quot;<p>UN World Migration Report 2020 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;un2.un.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;wmr_2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;un2.un.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;wmr_2020.pdf</a><p>Back to the 200 million figure:<p>&quot;This is a daunting figure; representing a ten-fold increase over todayâ€™s entire documented refugee and internally displaced  populations.

Today, about 3.5% of the global population lives in a country other than the one they were born in. This prediction is that by 2050 that figure will have an extra 3% on top attributable to climate change.')
