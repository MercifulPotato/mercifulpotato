The ideal hardware is something like the HP T610+ or T620+, which even have a PCIe slot for you to add a secondary ethernet interface if you don&#x27;t want to get a VLAN switch and have to do a router-on-a-stick configuration. The form factor is nice because it&#x27;s quiet, a lot smaller than a full PC, it&#x27;s set up for wall&#x2F;VESA mounting, and you don&#x27;t need to muck about with buying specialty cases as you do for MiniITX motherboards or other SBCs.<p>Anyway, predictably these things are being constantly cycled out and can typically be had on ebay for $100-200.')
