I wonder how this dynamic has shifted the outcome of Y Combinator alumni companies. Perhaps we would have more Googles if this trend of raising less had persisted.<p>Money breeding laziness is also what killed ICOs. Naive teams with revolutionary ideas (which may have changed the world in <i>startup</i> form) raised tens of millions of dollars. This money removed the need for groundedness and scrappiness in the development process. As a result, a lot of value and time was squandered on tech that hasn&#x27;t panned out.')
