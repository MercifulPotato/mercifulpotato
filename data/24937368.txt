Scientifically, sure, but morally we&#x27;ve been the same for thousands of years. He has quite a nihilistic view that leads to political indifference. Here&#x27;s a talk of his that explains his position in more detail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jmRBHCclzZk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jmRBHCclzZk</a><p>In short, however:<p>e.g. &quot;Gray does not deny the reality of scientific, technological, and material improvements. He only insists that the things we mean when we call such improvements “progress”—that gains, once made, are not lost but built upon, that setbacks are rare and temporary—has no analogy in morality or human affairs: “Knowledge increases at an accelerating rate, but human beings are no more reasonable than they have ever been.” - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nybooks.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;john-gray-atheism-myth-progress&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nybooks.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;21&#x2F;john-gray-atheis...</a>')
