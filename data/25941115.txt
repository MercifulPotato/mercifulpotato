In this case, the price will be lower than the brand drug, but not by much, since there&#x27;s only one maker and no competition.<p>2) Several drug companies are allowed to design their own versions of the brand drug. Because there are several competing brands with essentially the same product in the marketplace, competition causes the prices drop.<p>If your company targets the first type, you replace another company as the sole producer of the generic, and there&#x27;s still no competition to drive the price down.<p>If you target the second type, you become an additional competitor to the other generic drug makers, so the market gets a bit more competitive, but the prices in theory were already competitive because of the number of makers. For example, the Lexapro generic Escitalopram has many makers, so you can get it for as low as $10.<p>So in terms of generics, the options are either single source agreements where pricing won&#x27;t be competitive by design, or multiple makers, where the pricing is likely already competitive. Having said that, which of those does your company want to target, and how do they plan to tackle it?')
