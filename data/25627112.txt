Clojure&#x27;s is more so than most.&quot;<p>Personally, I think the technology itself is fine. The ecosystem, from my exposure to it, has a few warts. It&#x27;s somewhat small, which I expect of what is still a niche language. The killer issue for me was the memes that slowed and discouraged the development of useful frameworks in favor of gluing together ad-hoc sets of libraries.<p>Of course, it may have just been that I was working with a batch of Clojure devs who were in those jobs because they were sold on the glories of functional programming purity. Hard to say. They were better than the Haskell shop I worked in, but not as much so as I would have liked.')
