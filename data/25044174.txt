Humans sense quite a few different types of such input data, but we can&#x27;t sense <i>everything</i> there is to be sensed.<p>In your last two paragraphs, I believe you state that consciousness is just the (mathematical) reflexivity of &quot;thoughts&quot; (i.e. representational processes concerning objects).\nThat&#x27;s an interesting thought I&#x27;ve pondered as well, but doesn&#x27;t that just move the problem to whether machines can produce such thoughts?\nCertainly they can produce representations of thoughts, but do they really <i>think</i> them?')
