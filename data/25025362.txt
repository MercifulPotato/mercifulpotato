This isn&#x27;t at loggerheads with the idea of an application, but let&#x27;s such applications share concepts - where app2 can extend app1&#x27;s concepts by defining more specialized methods. So if Instagram exposed an &quot;image&quot; concept (which might be named Abstract image in Julia) , Photoshop should be able to run with the provided capabilities and specialise a custom notion of image as paint on canvas&quot; or illustrator can add &quot;vector drawing&quot; capabilities. Then, depending on how the specialization is done, it would be possible for Instagram to post vector drawings. (Simplifying a bit to illustrate)<p>This is a common enough pattern between libraries in Julia dedicated to doing very different things and yet cooperate beautifully.')
