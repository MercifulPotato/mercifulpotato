In paragraph 6.2, after the definition of “English language course”, insert:\n  “ “EU national” in Appendix T5 (Temporary Worker) International\n  Agreement Worker means a person who is a national of: Austria, Belgium,\n  Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,\n  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania,\n  Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,\n  Slovenia, Spain, or Sweden; and who is not also a British citizen.”.\n\n  Changes to Part 7\n  7.1. For the second paragraph 276BB1(vi)(d), substitute:\n  “(e) the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the\n  Department for International Development or the Foreign, Commonwealth\n  and Development Office has determined should qualify for relocation under\n  the ex-gratia redundancy &#x2F; resignation package, including confirmation that\n  they served ‘on frontline duties outside the wire in Helmand’.”.\n</code></pre>\nAnyone interpreting this law (i.e. lawyers) does not have the &quot;latest&quot; version to hand; they have to stack successive changes.<p>There are other complications, which I can&#x27;t recall, but I dearly wish someone would do this for UK law.')
