I haven’t tested it in a long time though.<p>I tried to make a video demonstrating it a couple years ago, but VBox video recording mangled it due to a bug.  I found it amusing that one bug preventing me from demonstrating another bug.<p>I tried figuring out how to report something like that to MS and gave up.  It’s way too much hassle.')
