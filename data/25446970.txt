When Bitcoin a year-and-a-half old, it had a bug that required a five-hour chain rollback.<p>Bitcoin people will object and say that was a bug with the blockchain itself. However, sample code on ethereum.org had vulnerabilities similar to TheDAO&#x27;s bug, so arguably it was a platform issue on Ethereum as well.<p>There have been large thefts from contracts since then, including a &gt;$100M theft from Parity, the most popular client at the time. Parity made several attempts to get another fork to recover their funds, and they were roundly rejected by the community.')
