The items were: “If the United States had a major say in the world, the world would be a much better place,” “The United States deserves special treatment,” “It really makes me angry when others criticize the United States,” “Not many people seem to fully understand the importance of the United States,” and “I will never be satisfied until the United States gets the recognition it deserves.” All items used a seven-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).<p>I dunno, that doesn&#x27;t sound sound to me, and people tend to draw bold conclusions from such matters.<p>I&#x27;ve seen quite a lot of such papers, proving that &quot;conservatives are knowing liberals better than vice versa&quot; or similar, but diving into methodology it seems like people are trying to exacerbate what the data says.<p>People voting for Trump are regular blue collar workers loosing from globalization.
