The top tax bracket (Spitzensteuersatz) is 42% and is reached when you earn a laughable 57k€ a year, something that will never allow you to afford an apartment in a city for a family. The next higher tax rate is 45% for income above 279k€ a year (Rich tax).

You could consider that maybe conservative Germany encourages investment in real estate. Nope, you get to pay 6% sales tax and 1% notary fees when you buy a home, with no breaks for first-time home buyers, and you can&#x27;t write the interest off on your taxes either.')
