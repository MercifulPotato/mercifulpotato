If we don&#x27;t assume malice, what is the reason Telegram is rolling its own non-standard crypto like this? Were there no widely publicized E2E protocols that would fit the bill at the time Telegram was being developed? (i.e. was it started before Signal had become known, or does that protocol have limitations that Telegram found unacceptable?) Or did the team have someone in charge with a bit of not-invented-here-syndrome that was just gung-ho on rolling their own no matter what? (wouldn&#x27;t be the first time something like that has happened). And has any effort been made to validate the protocol, despite being a bit weird, so we might eventually trust it as much as Signal?')
