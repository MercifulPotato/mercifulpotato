To investigate whether mechanical compression could contribute to this increase, we subjected 14 male volunteers to mechanical testicular compression via a pneumatic cuff. The serum testosterone levels were sampled at time intervals before, during and after compression. There was a rise in mean serum testosterone levels of 16.7-18.2%, with a maximal increase at 1.5 min after compression was released. Mechanical compression alone did not explain the rise in serum testosterone, although it may have a contributory role.')
