The &quot;rent discount&quot; is what you&#x27;d put in the stock market for the purposes of these comparisons.<p>A good &quot;rent vs. buy&quot; calculator will let you easily visualize these terms, e.g. this [NYT calculator](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;buy-rent-calculator.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;buy-rent-cal...</a>) which helpfully shows you the sensitivity of the outcome on each parameter.<p>I think your model here oversimplifies and misses some of the key details.<p>In more detail, you need to consider that your mortgage is going to be more expensive than rent, so if you&#x27;re renting you have an extra $X&#x2F;mo to invest in the stock market. Plus you have your deposit $Y that you&#x27;d invest in the stock market as well. Then you need to make your prediction on what the growth rate per annum of stocks vs. real estate is going to be, and compound your investments accordingly over time.')
