Their gender is irrelevant.<p>Edit: for the record, I think we should be able to use flippant and juvenile language in our blog titles (at risk of seeming juvenile), but I’ve been in tech long enough to catch the increasing wind of the “men can handle words like techbro but women can’t” implication.  Using cute gendered language for women isn’t quite as savory today.')
