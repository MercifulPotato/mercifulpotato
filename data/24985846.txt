It&#x27;s not fair to expect an early stage founder who is a teacher to teach all the children in the world for free at the beginning stage of their company. If I am to build upon what I&quot;m started, partner with districts and non-profits to make it accessible and free to all, I need partners to help build it. This is in no way a finished project. It&#x27;s a mission and an idea. The goal is to make it great and universally accessible. We&#x27;re far from there yet, but I think it&#x27;s worth trying.')
