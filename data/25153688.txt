You know what the government there advised? Everyone should be masked.<p>Taiwan: 609 cases (7 deaths)<p>US: 12 million cases (250k deaths)<p>Their <i>metro</i> stayed open while we&#x27;re telling people to not go sit in the park.<p>Taiwan was hit earlier, Taiwan is closer and denser, Taiwan has many travelers to and from Mainland China. There was one right answer. None of this &quot;they were trying to avoid&quot; shit. They just solved the problem. This is the sort of thing it&#x27;s not good enough to try. You have to be good enough to do it. Clearly what we did is we put a bunch of Pee Wee Leaguers in the MLB and we got the socks knocked out of us. The lesson isn&#x27;t &quot;they tried&quot;. The lesson is &quot;next time, get the A players&quot;.<p>The one thing that this has taught us is that the Anna Karenina Principle applies pretty well to national organizations. All the guys who did well did it the same way. Everyone who sucked, sucked in their own way.')
