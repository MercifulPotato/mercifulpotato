Is it <i>your</i> definition?  The US Federal Government&#x27;s?  Who gets to make those decisions keeping in mind a niche subreddit (or even a full site like we are on here) will already have a <i>very</i> different demographic than the real world?<p>Not to mention, sorting and censoring people based on a classification that is outside of their control is quite a... controversial way to go about things.<p>&gt;Managing private communities of tens of thousands of people require some disciplined rules in order for the entity&#x27;s leaders to achieve their goals.<p>Establishing, enforcing, and maintaining &quot;disciplined rules&quot; should not, and do not need to, mean &quot;shadow bans, rate limiting, etc&quot;.  Certainly not without a human element capable of contextual analysis, at least.<p>--<p>I disagree with you, but respect for explaining your beliefs.')
