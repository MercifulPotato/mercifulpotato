It&#x27;s the tight integration of the toolkit with applications that causes this issue. If there was loose integration between the file picker and the application and its toolkit, like with the newer xdg-deskop-portal protocol, it would be simpler for someone to create a better file picker witout risking breaking anything else, and for applications to be made to use it.')
