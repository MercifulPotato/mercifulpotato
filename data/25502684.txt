Creativity needs limits. If your limits can imply something about your desired design goals then thatâ€™s a good synergy. It also forces the engineers to think more about design rather than fall back on their goto pattern that may or may not fit the problem.\nEspecially junior and mid level engineers might not have good heuristics on is their design any good or is it just following whatever cargo cult they were brought up in.<p>Like one engineer on my team implemented this crazy overkill logger and I asked a few questions why do it like this and the answer was that they had implemented it in another language at another company. After that I told them to not have more abstraction layers than concrete implementations when adding a new feature.')
