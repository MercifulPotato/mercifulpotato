You don’t hire a bunch of innovative people to boost it because it’s not going to ever increase your revenue.<p>The distinction is made from a strategic perspective because scaling up “cost centers” should be avoided at all costs and scaling up “profit centers” is something you want to do as much as you can.<p>It has no overlap with “interesting work”. Very often the boring parts of an industry are the profit centers (e.g. in academia the profit comes from packing students into classrooms, not research).')
