We have to decide which distinctions are important either because of in-built neural structure, or what we&#x27;re exposed to (like learning the phoneme set of a language).<p>While unsupervised learning can pick out a bunch of ways of distinguishing groups of data points, mapping between those and the representations required by a symbolic system still seems like a step no one has figured out.')
