Item(by='dom96', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609426950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592489, text='&gt; I&#x27;m creating a graphical program with a http server running in the background, and mixing asynchttp with UI threads is a bit of a pain in the posterior. Granted, I&#x27;m new to the language, I&#x27;m considering using channels, maybe that will make it easier to share state between threads.<p>Ideally you shouldn&#x27;t need to use UI threads and instead integrate the async loop into the UI&#x27;s event loop or vice versa. Happy to advise more if you can let me know which UI framework you are using :)<p>This being said, I am hoping to implement better support for using `spawn` and channels with async, i.e. the ability to await the result of `spawn` or a channel. I think that will make a lot of use cases much easier.')
