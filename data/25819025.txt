Item(by='015a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610953181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25818484, text='The only reason I&#x27;m not bullish on Microsoft is because I don&#x27;t know where else they can expand to. Teams is growing in Microsoft shops. There are a LOT of these; if these shops had real-time chat, it took the form of either something like Skype (useless) or a half-dozen siloed Slack servers started by employees (no company-wide benefit). So, they add on Teams; usually its already in the plan they&#x27;re paying for. Suddenly they realize how alluring real-time chat can be. I&#x27;m not convinced its actually more productive for what people use it for, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to real-time chat&#x27;s ability to <i>fool</i> you (and the administrators) into thinking its increasing productivity, and that&#x27;s all that matters for usage.<p>But how does Microsoft reap that into something meaningful? They&#x27;re not monetizing the app store (that I&#x27;ve seen); they&#x27;re not monetizing the entire product; maybe it increases lockin, but most of these companies are so lockedin anyway they were never leaving. The argument for data sharing is interesting, but: I hate Microsoft with a feverish passion, and even I&#x27;ll admit that if they were sharing&#x2F;correlating significant employee data beyond the firewall of some AD&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;whatever instance, they&#x27;d have a lot of very angry customers on their hands. I don&#x27;t see them doing that.<p>I&#x27;m biased, but I&#x27;m still bearish on them just because their reliable revenue centers are becoming less and less diversified. Yeah, Azure&#x2F;365. What else do they have? Windows is more and more irrelevant. Browser; lost the war. Github; an expensive side-business. Xbox; a billion dollar money pit with their leaders at the top praying for Halo Infinite. Consumer hardware; nothing. Linkedin; its like Facebook, everyone hates it but everyone has one. If all of their revenue growth is in Cloud, that&#x27;s still a ton of growth to reap, but I&#x27;m not sure it justifies a valuation previously assigned to the 2000s-era multi-disciplinary conglomerate Microsoft was. Amazon is fully capable of (at least) keeping pace with Azure&#x27;s growth here, and they&#x27;re also the biggest retailer on the planet with an unassailable operations network. I think, over the next five years, it&#x27;ll be increasingly &quot;weird&quot; how those two companies are priced so similarly.')
