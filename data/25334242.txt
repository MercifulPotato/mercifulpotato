A ton of the classes that are generated are screen size variants.<p>The IDE strain is overblown. There is an official Tailwind plugin for most IDEs and it performs well, even with the massive CSS files you use for development (but are purged&#x2F;tree-shaken for production). Computers are really good at parsing text, and even at their worst, the CSS files are never more than a MB or two. Even if you enable ever single flag for every token, the dev file size is around 10MB I think. Big to load over the internet, but locally, and being parsed, not a huge problem at all.')
