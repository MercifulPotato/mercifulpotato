Layout capabilities of CSS are orders of magnitude less extensive compared to those of TeX. For example it is nearly impossible to say, put a box 2&#x2F;3 of the width of a container of unknown width. Just the simple task of centering an element has pages dedicated to it and to my knowledge, only CSS3 has a reasonably workable solution. As far as LaTeX&#x27;s abilities as a programming language go, I have an interpreter for a reasonable subset of C written in TeX (it was an academic exercise but this is just to show what is possible). So it is much more than a mere markup language.')
