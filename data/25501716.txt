We chose to embrace and integrate open source projects to create a simple and seamless experience with best in breed solutions for various tasks.<p>We are particularly happy with our deep integration of JupyterLab building on the excellent Jupyter Enterpise Gateway project from IBM (Codait) for connecting kernels directly to your pipelines. For scheduling we build on top of Celery combined with containerization primitives. For stable and well defined dependency management we built a small  environment abstraction on top of Docker. It works really well in our experience!<p>Feel free to check out the project on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orchest&#x2F;orchest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;orchest&#x2F;orchest</a><p>Self hosting should be as easy as running about two lines of code.')
