For example, things that disguise baldness are &quot;for insecure men&quot;. I am also told that judging people&#x27;s physical appearance is immoral or even shaming.<p>On the other hand I suspect it has likewise made it very difficult to get dates. If I conclude that being bald lowers my odds am I insecure? Am I diminishing women&#x27;s sense of being shamed by men by claiming I myself feel rejected?<p>The data, however, makes things more clear. I&#x27;ve never tried an experiment like that. Thanks for sharing.')
