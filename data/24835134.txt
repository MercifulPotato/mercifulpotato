This was legal[0]. With the benefit of hindsight, we can claim that refusing to serve Black people was indeed &quot;taking a side&quot;, but there were places where supporting the pro-integration people was breaking the law. And refusing to serve Black people, until they staged sit ins, didn&#x27;t appear to be taking a side, because it wasn&#x27;t uncommon. It was the way <i>most</i> places worked.<p>Even the mission to &quot;serve everyone a sandwich&quot; doesn&#x27;t require addressing segregation, you can have separate lunch counters and serve everyone. Perhaps that&#x27;s fine, people at the time certainly thought it was.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;black-history&#x2F;the-greensboro-sit-in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;black-history&#x2F;the-greensboro-...</a>')
