As someone whose pet issue has been police and justice system violence for a really, really long time, I really wish BLM wasn&#x27;t the organization&#x2F;movement representing this particular struggle[1]. The 2020 iteration is a little more connected to reality and a little less hateful than the 2015 one, so I&#x27;d count myself as a supporter in a way that I didn&#x27;t in 2015, but if you&#x27;ve not come across _any_ valid criticism of them before now, I suggest sitting down and taking a hard look at your media diet.<p>By far the scariest facet of the modern moment to me is all the people sneering at Trumpists detachment from reality while happily wallowing in their own post-truth bubble. The average person has always been horribly un- and misinformed, but the shift in the last couple of years in my white-collar, coastal social group legitimately terrifies me.<p>[1] Though I&#x27;m well-aware that getting attention and support is probably the most important part of driving social change, and they&#x27;ve obviously done very well there.')
