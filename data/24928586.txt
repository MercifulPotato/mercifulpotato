So, in that way, his situation makes a very fitting example of many of the things wrong with cancel culture and highlights a few of the reasons why detractors oppose this kind of attack.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s unfortunate that, despite buying into cancel culture and believing it is merely &quot;facing consequences&quot;, he doesn&#x27;t mention any names. If I were in favor of this kind of social retribution, I definitely would think that the members of this committee should &quot;face consequences&quot;. At the very least, they should be removed from the committee, as clearly these people shouldn&#x27;t have the authority to enforce any CoC, let alone a particularly nebulous one.<p>All in all, though, I feel very bad for him and, if nothing else, hopefully this doesn&#x27;t bring him any more trouble.')
