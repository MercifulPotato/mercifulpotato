The hash ID is generated by hashing the contents of the entire file. Not the diff.<p>The &quot;diff&quot; you&#x27;re referring to is an implementation detail of the compression. It&#x27;s not even always there; it depends on which commits are present in your clone. It&#x27;s also not even the same &quot;diff&quot; you work with when you use git to generate or apply patches. Using the same word only leads to confusion.')
