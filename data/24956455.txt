I&#x27;m not a lawyer and don&#x27;t know a lot about copyright or derived works either, but the &quot;creativity&quot; thing comes up in discussions sometimes.<p>If you give me a sequence of integers from 1 to 1000 (which is not a creative work and therefore not copyrightable), and I selectively delete some of the integers such that the differences between adjacent numbers contains a fun message in ASCII, and publish that sequence, the result is copyright because those particular deletions add a creative element.<p>But if I just deleted every alternate number in the sequence, that wouldn&#x27;t be copyrightable because it&#x27;s not creative.  (Although you can imagine some scenario when doing so might be creative, it would need some reason why it was.)<p>Basically, if Dev B does a change that passes some threshold of creativity, then they have a claim.  If they just go through and delete all the blank lines and reformat in a standard way, they probably don&#x27;t.<p>In your example, I think it would depend on which 20 lines and whether they were trivial changes to figure out.')
