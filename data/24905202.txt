Item(by='lbeltrame', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603784560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24904502, text='&gt; None of the vaccines currently on the table are even remotely good enough for &#x27;back to normalish.&#x27; The attack rate for this virus is so high that a vaccine good enough (i.e. multiple 9s effectiveness) to allow &#x27;back to normal&#x27; almost certainly isn&#x27;t possible.<p>Is it? Current studies, AFAIK, give very variable attack rates, from low zeros to around 30%. Only higher if due to close contacts for longer periods of time (carriers, fishing boats, meat packing plants). This preprint on trasmission dynamics and evidence from September[1] has lower figures.<p>&gt; Everyone who&#x27;s alive now will almost certainly need to socially distance (and should wear an N95&#x2F;KN95 mask in public indoor spaces) for the rest of their lives.<p>I wonder how we&#x27;re even supposed to build a society that can live without any or very reduced form of contact. I think it&#x27;s socially unsustainable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692807" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692807</a>')
