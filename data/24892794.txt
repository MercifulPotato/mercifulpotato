Others live (in my case lived) there because of a job. I don&#x27;t care for SF the city, but I do like the greater bay area.<p>Having said that, your driving time estimates are incredible optimistic. Squaw is not 3 hours from SF, not even with no traffic (this scenario doesn&#x27;t really exist) and good weather. Getting anywhere in the bay area also takes significantly longer due to traffic which is pretty bad most of the day.')
