You can&#x27;t be distinguished from an attacker, from the computer&#x27;s perspective. Having the computer be able to attest that it&#x27;s unmodified means that it doesn&#x27;t have to mistrust you so aggressively, relative to today.<p>Requiring a reboot to rescue mode to disable SIP is sufficient to block most social engineering attacks that would otherwise have you click through dialogs to bypass it. A dedicated attacker can still overcome this, and once they do, they can impersonate you readily.<p>If the computer can attest that it&#x27;s unmodified, then it&#x27;s possible to throw up alarms for non-expert users when their computer is in that state. I don&#x27;t think most websites will bother, but those that care sure would love to be able to do so. None of this is specifically for the benefit of users who want to hack the software internals of their computers, though â€” but those are not the target market for security practices today in any case, since they can overcome literally any barrier <i>prior to</i> this that says &quot;please secure your device before entering&quot;.<p>Still, from an IT standpoint, it sure would be nice to find out how many expert technical users are <i>lying</i> about keeping their system in secure mode when they have privileged access, because they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary and they don&#x27;t see any harm in lying about it. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s something like 10-20% of all IT admins using unmanaged devices. We&#x27;ll find out soon enough!')
