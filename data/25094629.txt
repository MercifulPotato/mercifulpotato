This is a distraction from the real issue which is this technology exists not to improve the security posture but to enforce market control.<p>So go back a few weeks and you buy a copy of Fortnite, Apple and Epic lock horns on a dispute and they revoke Epic&#x27;s certificate. Next thing you get a shiny new M1 equipped Mac and go to install it and it&#x27;s gone from the app store. Slightly deflated, you go back to your Mac and copy the files off it onto your new one, thinking you circumvented this slyly, it does an OCSP check and refuses to run the binary. Eventually the OCSP check will be done, probably after an OS upgrade on your old Mac and that&#x27;s gone too. So you&#x27;re deprived of something you paid for and have no control over the hardware you paid for.<p>This is an example of what <i>could</i> happen.<p>If it improved security posture the signing infrastructure wouldn&#x27;t be used to sign any old shit from millions of developers doing all sorts of nefarious things that Apple didn&#x27;t pick up during the review process...<p>Edit: this has already been demonstrated if you refer to the Flappy Bird mess a few years back.')
