I don&#x27;t know what percentage of advertising revenue is from political advertising, but that&#x27;s money that Facebook makes off of you that doesn&#x27;t come out of your pocket. Essentially any time you&#x27;re shown an ad that aims to convince you to support some idea, or vote for something, or change your behavior in some way (like going vegan) instead of trying to get you go spend money, you provide value to Facebook that doesn&#x27;t come out of your pocket.<p>I suspect that this is a lot of the value of &quot;the next billion&quot;. Why bring Facebook to people who have little disposable income? Because there are still ad buyers who will pay to reach those audiences if they have votes to give, or even just public support for some cause or another.')
