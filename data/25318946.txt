To make that more sustainable, we create a lot of group housing. Now imagine that someone in that group housing gets it in their mind that it would make them a YouTube star to burn their house down live. They succeed in their arson and burn their house and the house of all those around them to the ground.<p>This person doesn&#x27;t deserve to be without a home at least for a little while?<p>[Edit<p>I forgot an even more important class of individuals... The homeless we refer to as hobos (aka the intentional homeless population who choose it as a lifestyle where they are freed from the demands of society and in turn be undemanding upon society).  Do not these people deserve to have their homelessness respected?  They are a small portion of the population but it seems a valid life strategy and I have had a conversation with the man who described his homelessness in this way and claimed to have friends who felt similarly.  Reduce your expenditures sufficiently and it takes very little investment income to have a sustainable life of no obligations.  The ethics of economic rents aside.<p>]')
