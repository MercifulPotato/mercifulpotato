I don&#x27;t know who you are.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing, you can be a conservative and not align with the opinions of nazis. But if you look at the nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups attacking the capitol; and say &quot;I think they&#x27;re working for a good cause&quot;, I&#x27;m going to make some assumptions.<p>If you stop and find yourself arguing similar talking points as nazi groups... I don&#x27;t know what you expect to happen. This isn&#x27;t hyperbole. These are literal nazi groups. We are so far removed from what should be a societally tolerable difference of opinion. It&#x27;s not &quot;conservatism&quot; at play here.')
