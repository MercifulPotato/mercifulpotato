Super excited to see this on HN!<p>That&#x27;s a great breakdown. I hadn&#x27;t put my finger on stakeholder or customer empathy before, but I agree they&#x27;re critical skills.<p>&gt; Unfortunately these three areas are soft skills and you won&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve improved until you find yourself reciting a fact. Usually you&#x27;ll think &quot;well duh, because the customer thinks this.&quot; It&#x27;ll seem obvious, but it is only because you went through the trenches to learn that fact.<p>Definitely. This reminds me of Siver&#x27;s &quot;Obvious to you, Amazing to others&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sive.rs&#x2F;obvious" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sive.rs&#x2F;obvious</a>).<p>I&#x27;m trying to spend the rest of the year documenting as much of this soft-knowledge as I can.
