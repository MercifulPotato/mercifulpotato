Apple&#x27;s stance is that your data is safe with Apple. Once your data is outside of Apple walls, it is fair game for hundreds of ad tech companies. These companies might be data brokers that aggregate user behavior, they might be mobile analytics for app developers, it can be google or FB,  etc. Advertisers rely on ad tech to deliver relevant advertising and to measure the change or impact on consumer behavior.
