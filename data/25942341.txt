The support contracts would run in the hundreds of millions and be a <i>huge</i> boost to the improvement of said software. Not to mention some internal IT teams would probably be contributing patches for their specific use cases and bugs.<p>* I am aware the EU has relatively little power to enforce such a thing.')
