I wonder why more accurate instructions resulted in more problems. I know you mentioned &#x27;disengagement,&#x27; but wouldn&#x27;t more detail and accuracy make it easier to do the exercise(s)? Or does it make the students just zone out and type the lines out without thinking?<p>(I know I certainly was guilty of that the first time I went through the Linux From Scratch book.)')
