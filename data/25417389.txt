The payment being slightly higher based on the speed&#x2F;bandwidth of the node I&#x27;ve provided.<p>I imagine the payment could be a combination of a &quot;pay what you can&quot; donation as in this example, and a generated coin based on the increase in value of having a network like this in a regional area.')
