As others have pointed out, Robinhood lends margin to some accounts and if those accounts cannot pay for losses purchased on margin, Robinhood is responsible. This is a real risk, and they should have made the margin requirement 100% for GME or cash only as other brokers did. They did not have to limit buys to de-risk their own portfolio.')
