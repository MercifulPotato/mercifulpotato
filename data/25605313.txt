It turns out to be the central question. If I buy a book from Amazon and want to sell it on eBay, who needs to opt in? I certainly shouldn’t need your permission as you’re not involved. Is the paper manufacturer involved in me selling the book on eBay?  Is the author? The publisher? Amazon? Me taking something I buy on Amazon and selling it on eBay has a pretty direct analogy here (sell what I buy from local pizza co to my app users). Asking for opt in is just a different way to phrase it, unfortunately.<p>That said, I’m glad for this law. Maybe it’s not perfectly worded but it’s a net good. What the delivery companies were doing was such blatant exploitation of everyone involved and I’m glad to see it go.')
