Extremists being a domestic group, mere association canâ€™t be criminalised [EDIT: is difficult to criminalise]. Only individual actions can be criminally pursued.<p>Other than that legal distinction, the two groups (right-wing <i>extremists</i>, not all right wing Americans, and <i>bona fide</i> ISIS members, not everyone in ISIS-occupied territory) are comparable. They spread their misinformation similarly. And could be expected to be similarly curtailed by deplatforming.')
