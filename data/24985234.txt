I only needed information on that one little thing to be productive, but I&#x27;d get stuck reading someone&#x27;s entire backstory, trying to skim and find the one useful line in a random example to help me.<p>Other times, I would find documentation and struggle to follow it in practice until I came to the conclusion that I would need to read the whole thing in its entirety to become productive. I would either have to block out some time to learn it all or go with a completely different solution.<p>I used to think projects that claimed to be documented either fit into two groups:<p>1. Good documentation: I can find what I&#x27;m looking for<p>2. Bad documentation: I can&#x27;t find what I&#x27;m looking for<p>My eyes were opened when I read something that I have since committed to memory: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.divio.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.divio.com</a><p>There isn&#x27;t just good documentation and bad documentation, there are 4 different kinds of documentation for distinct types of information delivery: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Explanations, and finally Reference.<p>Now I consider documentation good or bad based on if it contains all 4 kinds of documentation.')
