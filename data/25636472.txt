Beyond just Brexit, it&#x27;s not out of the realm of possibility that the &#x27;majority&#x27; could vote to nullify constitutional checks to the power of a president, to term length, to guarantees on the protection of individual rights and freedoms, etc. Of course any such votes are deemed to be in the interest of the &#x27;people&#x27;. The ancients and the US at its founding were wise enough to mix democracy, the at the moment will of the people, with various checks, balances and buffers. The US seems to be moving to more and more pure democracy. In my humble opinion this is dangerous, a slippery slope, a camel&#x27;s nose under the tent, etc.')
