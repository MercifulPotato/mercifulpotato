Otherwise, you just have a (more or less) conservative bureaucracy with a few rituals thrown in (rituals that, without said stories, are without origin).<p>&gt; <i>Whether the material is right or wrong is beside the point. If it has merit then invariably it will come in a different package sooner rather than later. Time is scarce, and attention is oxygen for people with an ax to grind.</i><p>What??? Saying that &quot;whether the material is right or wrong is beside the point,&quot; is maybe the most absurd thing I&#x27;ve heard today. Regardless of the package, if something is true, it is true. With your mentality, one can construe very absurd conceptions of morality.<p><i>After all, it&#x27;s mightily important that we don&#x27;t tell the common folk the Earth is not the center of the universe, because</i> &lt;insert_religious_reason&gt;. <i>Galileo is a strange man with strange views (only supported by an equally strange Prussian fellow). I think those views will, if correct, surely come in a</i> more acceptable package <i>at some point.</i><p>————<p>As a note of personal bias, I find it hard to sympathize with people who foster military ties as you claim to have.')
