Suddenly, it&#x27;s cheaper to import corn from the US than buy at a local farm house in other places. This alone doesn&#x27;t mean bad news to those other countries. The likely response may not be to increase import tax on corn.<p>You need to see where the net positive results are accumulating as a consequence.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution to these complicated problems. My observation is today&#x27;s policy won&#x27;t solve the problem even slightly.<p>The US specializes in innovation, incentivizes economy to create innovation. IT consulting is not innovation. When you start hiring local employees at a higher salaries, influences inflation.. and what does this inflation from IT mean to other sectors?<p>The right question is: What would be the cost of home grown IT consulting that can compete with Indian IT consulting? How fast can those policies be deployed? is it even in the US interest to pursue this direction?<p>What I don&#x27;t see is a framework that doesn&#x27;t look like a patch work.<p>It&#x27;s definitely targeted to win elections. The real promise is not delivered.')
