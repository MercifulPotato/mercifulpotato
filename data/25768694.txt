Hiring people based on race seems condescending and might fuel resentment.<p>The issue with this for me, and probably for many non-Americans, is that explicitly favouring particular races at all is pretty baffling, it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed here.<p>Personally I think they should launch programs to help disadvantaged people, regardless of race and sex. Why exclude poor white people, and why include wealthy black people? Racism is not the only reason someone may have a hard time in America, it&#x27;s a very difficult place to live for anyone that is poor or lacks supportive parents.')
