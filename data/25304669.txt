For example, maybe they can create forums via this system for their gaming guild etc.<p>Yes, advertisers can purchase an account but there might be a popular moderator who bans these viral advertisements, based on popularity of ad-blocker I imagine such an moderator would get bunch of subscribers. Perhaps moderators can make some money through their subscribers as well, might be an interesting scheme.<p>Also spot price is pretty strong deterrent for advertisers especially if they keep getting banned through popular moderators.')
