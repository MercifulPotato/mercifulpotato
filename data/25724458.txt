My rule of thumb is that anytime you tell yourself you will avoid learning something in electronics you will eventually have to learn it. That said, you can get a very long way by knowing almost nothing at all beyond high school science and playing lego, and I&#x27;m not talking about arduino at all. Need an Analog Front End? Take one from a reference design, take their code while you are at it. Want to know what is messing with your circuit? Learn and understand Maxwell&#x27;s equations, or put it on a scope and google about. If you want to get products manufactured there is a lot to learn but if you do normal well understood things you don&#x27;t need to be brilliant or talented.')
