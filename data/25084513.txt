One measly holiday season, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re being asked to compromise. Surely we can manage that?<p>Think of our grandparents in WWII (or other wars) would have said: &quot;just cancelling get-togethers for <i>one single</i> Christmas? And you&#x27;re complaining? Ha! How many <i>years</i> we had to ration foods, gasoline, rubber, keep the lights off, curfews, etc?&quot;<p>I weep for our society if we lack the personal discipline and civic pride to be able to handle this relatively limited set back responsibly.')
