They employer is after all paying for it, even if its given as a &quot;perk&quot;.<p>Personally however I would not spend to much energy and time worrying about that. I don&#x27;t expect google to pay programmers to support my side projects, and I would be actually a bit worry if they contributed to anything critical at the place where i work. Google might find coexistence acceptable today, but if they have paid employees to work on code for a competing company (even if its just for one of their commercial products) then I would see a risk that one day they would prefer to own what they are today giving out for free.')
