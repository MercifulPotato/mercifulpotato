Do you know how much trouble disabled students would have to go through to deal with this?<p>You know disabled students have the right to privacy too, without other students knowing their personal health information. It is not the professor&#x27;s business either, unless the student wants to disclose the actual disability&#x27;s name(s) or the specifics around it. Only disability status is required to be disclosed in the US.<p>I personally have 2 neurostimulators inside of me, a power injectable port in my chest (an indwelling central line), a semi-permanent continuous glucose monitor on my arm (external), and a semi-permanent insulin pump connected to my abdomen--and clipped to my waistband (external). All of these alarm to a metal detector.<p>Also, the neurostimulators and insulin pump are sensitive to metal detectors and millimeter wave technology, as in body scanners. The insulin pump is also sensitive to X-Ray radiation.<p>In the case of the insulin pump, it can interfere with the photosensor on the cartridge&#x2F;reservoir that detects the level of insulin remaining in the cartridge&#x2F;reservoir. This can literally cause the insulin pump to overdose the person with diabetes.<p>As for neurostimulators, one of the neurostimulators I have has formal reports in the FDA MAUDE database, where people had their lifesaving neurostimulator deactivated by metal detectors.<p>Oh yeah, I also forgot, I have 2 places in my body that have plates&#x2F;pins: my left shoulder and left ankle. That would set off a metal detector too.')
