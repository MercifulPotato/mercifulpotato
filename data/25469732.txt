Addiction is a health issue, and addicts shouldn&#x27;t be punished for it.<p>The dealers, those responsible for the deterioration of both physical and mental health of the users, are directly responsible for that and should face charges for the damage they inflict on society. I think that is a very real and not imagined distinction.<p>I obviously concede that without a legal alternative to obtaining drugs that yes, the gov&#x27;t would be endorsing an illegal market. But, clearly, I&#x27;ve stated that&#x27;s an intermediary step and I believe the sale of these drugs should be legal in a highly controlled environment to consenting adults.<p>I also think meth and opiods are exceptions and should never be legalized for consumption outside of a prescription, but then I&#x27;m splitting hairs based on opinion and experience.')
