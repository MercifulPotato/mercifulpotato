Thus, they limit our rights for free speech online, prosecute for extremism, deny us rights to peacefully gather and protest.<p>If you Americans go down this path any further, you&#x27;ll too find yourself living under the tyrannical dictatorship no better than ours.<p>Oh, unfortunately, unlike you, we don&#x27;t have 2nd amendment rights, so actually rebelling is harder. So I suggest you clinging to your guns as strong as you can: all points that you are going to need them.')
