It doesn&#x27;t matter on which page you are.<p>But if you specify &quot;first 50 items after element N&quot; it gets really tricky, each BE shard needs to sort the first N elements, and it can use some trickery to avoid doing a naive merge (see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.medallia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;sorting-and-paging-on-distributed-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.medallia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;sorting-and-pagi...</a> ).<p>You can at most save some transfer over the network.')
