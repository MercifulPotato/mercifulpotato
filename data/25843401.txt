But have you considered that maybe the media representation is inaccurate? I&#x27;ve actually lived there, my wife comes from there, and my family is still there. This is <i>combined</i> with new information about China coming from the west, and having no restrictions here. I&#x27;ve studied some of China&#x27;s recent history, a subject which is rarely taught in the west. Why do you think you know the truth better than I do?<p>&gt; Also, why live in the Netherlands if China is so great? Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to move back there, if everything is on the up &amp; up?<p>Because China <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> great. I came here in 1993 with my parents, back then China was dirt-poor. My wife came here much more recently, in 2012, and she&#x27;s of the opinion that the Netherlands is very boring and has no good food compared to China. She&#x27;d fly back multiple times a year if she could.<p>For a more realistic perspective on Chinese society and its changes in the past 20 years, you should read this: The American Dream Is Alive in China\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;palladiummag.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-american-dream-is-alive-in-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;palladiummag.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-american-dream-is-al...</a><p>&gt; is kind of ridiculous.<p>This is a whole different topic. There&#x27;s a lot to deconstruct and to respond to in just those few sentences you typed, and those few links you sent. I would be glad to engage with you on this subject, but I have to know something first: do you truly wish for a conversation, or do you just want to stick with your existing opinion?<p>China has problems, but it isn&#x27;t the boogeyman the media makes it out to be. When the west better understands China, and when the west and China come together, the whole world wins.')
