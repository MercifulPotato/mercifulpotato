Item(by='giantrobot', descendants=None, kids=[25089547], score=None, time=1605317198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088312, text='The clock speed of ARM chips that have big.LITTLE cores is not very meaningful. The LITTLE cores can run at lower frequencies than the big cores. The Apple A series (and M series I will say with some confidence) support heterogeneous operation so both sets of cores can be active at once. The big cores can also be powered off if there&#x27;s no high priority&#x2F;power tasks.<p>The cores and frequency can scale up and down quickly so there&#x27;s not a meaningful clock speed measure. The best number you&#x27;ll get is the <i>maximum</i> frequency and that&#x27;s still not useful for comparing ARM chips to x86.<p>Even Intel&#x27;s chips don&#x27;t have frequency measures that are all that useful. Some workloads support TurboBoost but only within a certain thermal envelope. Even the max conventional clock for a chip is variable depending on thermals.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthwhile faulting Apple for not harping on the M series clock speeds since they&#x27;re a vector instead of a scalar value.')
