Most Bluetooth headphones will just effectively transcode the audio, such that for example AAC gets decompressed then recompressed into AptX&#x2F;LDAC. For music listening, it&#x27;s completely suboptimal. I use FLAC sources for my Sony headphones which makes them very listenable (along with copious EQ to tame the +5db excess bass). Bluetooth headphones have a lot of room for improvement.')
