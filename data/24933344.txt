If you look at e.g. any of the definitions in the free dictionary, you&#x27;ll find that they&#x27;re all about using abusive language towards someone, so the idea of &#x27;non-abusive swearing&#x27; at somebody in itself is as absurd as say a &#x27;non-abusive insult&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between swearing in front of your children and swearing at your children, one is possibly bad parenting, the other definitely is.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idioms.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;swear+at" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idioms.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;swear+at</a>')
