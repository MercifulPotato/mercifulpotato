Item(by='davorak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602997333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810497, text='&gt; paying a third party to handle moderation (and indemnify&#x2F;insure me against legal liability).<p>For any criminal material that makes it through the 3rd party moderation the publisher will be criminal liable. The third party can pay for the publishers lawyer to defend the publisher in court, but if the publisher is found guilty they will be the one in jail not the third party moderation service.<p>Ensuring the above does not happen is in part why Section 230 was put in place, at least to my understanding.<p>Your argument here does not seem to consider criminal liability does that change your outlook or was it already incorporated in your viewpoint somehow?')
