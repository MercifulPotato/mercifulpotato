I tend to agree with his response. Quoted below.<p>&gt; Benedict - thanks for your tweet. I&#x27;m a fan of your newsletter. Although VC might have a specific and limited definition in your book - as a certain kind of professional - it has a pretty common use in the vernacular: People who invest in start-ups, at a variety of stages, in the hopes that company will prosper. You may not respect the people who invested in Theranos, and you might not consider them part of your industry, but they were VCs. They were acting like VCS. They were investing in a start up in the hopes the company - and their investment - might prosper. They were evaluating companies and making bets. And while I would never call you or anyone else &#x27;lazy&#x27;, I&#x27;ve always appreciated the intellectual rigor you&#x27;ve brought to your writing. If you&#x27;d like to engage, I&#x27;m absolutely willing to do so. Calling me an intern or lazy, however, seems beneath us all. (Besides! There are some great interns!)<p>Source <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cduhigg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1330894337090015232" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cduhigg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1330894337090015232</a>')
