Federation would mean Matrix is about as likely to have a network-wide outage as email (or, for a more apt comparison, Mastodon).<p>Realistically, I understand that the Matrix.org homeserver is an enormous part of the network and an outage there would be comparable to this one.<p>However I believe that to be an orthogonal problem that also should be solved.<p>I&#x27;m actually curious, why does Matrix promote the Matrix.org homeserver so strongly? Why isn&#x27;t there an easy link to community-run homeservers?<p>If you look at Mastodon for example [0], their onboarding process directs you to a registry of community servers [1], which actively promotes diversity in the network and therefore network resilience and reliability.<p>Matrix meanwhile, just links you to element.io, which creates an account on the matrix.org homeserver.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinmastodon.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinmastodon.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinmastodon.org&#x2F;communities" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinmastodon.org&#x2F;communities</a>')
