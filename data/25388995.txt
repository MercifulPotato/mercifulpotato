One method that I think you’re talking about is when the temperature of the molten salts goes beyond a certain safety threshold then a heat sensitive plug is disintegrated and the Milton salts are drained into a safe underground reservoir for them to cool. (This is my recollection from that why thorium is the future video that went viral years ago) Can’t do that in a shipping container.')
