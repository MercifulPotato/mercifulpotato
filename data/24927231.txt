Greenwald et al. (1998) proposed that the IAT measures individual differences in implicit social cognition.  This claim requires evidence of construct validity. I review the evidence and show that there is insufficient evidence for this claim.  Most important, I show that few studies were able to test discriminant validity of the IAT as a measure of implicit personality characteristics and that a single-construct model fits multi-method data as well or better than a dual-construct models.  Thus, the IAT appears to be a measure of the same personality characteristics that are measured with explicit measures. I also show that the validity of the IAT varies across personality characteristics. It has low validity as a measure of self-esteem, moderate validity as a measure of racial bias, and high validity as a measure of political orientation.  The existing evidence also suggests that the IAT measures stable characteristics rather than states and has low predictive validity of single behaviors. Based on these findings, it is important that users of the IAT clearly distinguish between implicit measures and implicit constructs. The IAT is an implicit measure, but there is no evidence that it measures implicit constructs.<p><i>The Creators of the Implicit Association Test Should Get Their Story Straight</i> [1]<p>&gt; The problem, as I showed in a lengthy rundown of the many, many problems with the test published this past January, is that there’s very little evidence to support that claim that the IAT meaningfully predicts anything. In fact, the test is riddled with statistical problems — problems severe enough that it’s fair to ask whether it is effectively “misdiagnosing” the millions of people who have taken it, the vast majority of whom are likely unaware of its very serious shortcomings. There’s now solid research published in a top journal strongly suggesting the test cannot even meaningfully predict individual behavior. And if the test can’t predict individual behavior, it’s unclear exactly what it does do or why it should be the center of so many conversations and programs geared at fighting racism.<p><i>Psychology’s Favorite Tool for Measuring Racism Isn’t Up to the Job</i> [2]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicationindex.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;iat21&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replicationindex.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;iat21&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;iat-behavior-problem.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;iat-behavior-problem...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;psychologys-racism-measuring-...</a>')
