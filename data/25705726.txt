There are quite a lot of social media platforms out there to choose from, so I don&#x27;t really believe that people banned from them are truly &quot;deplatformed&quot;.<p>But it is quite another thing to advocate for internet <i>infrastructure</i> to take down websites that have not been proven to be illegal in any court of law.<p>Common carrier laws already exist, and apply to things like water pipes, the telephone network, and electricity.<p>IMO, it is time for those existing common carrier laws to be applied to critical internet infrastructure, if they do not apply already.')
