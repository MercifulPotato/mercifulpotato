Donald Trump clearly has been trying to seek approval and validation from people forever.  Likely this began in his childhood, if accounts of his father&#x27;s demeanor are to be believed.  Also, given his father&#x27;s characterization as a slum lord, there is little doubt in my mind that this is a family problem that has been passed down for some time; the fathers were mistreated and rejected as children, and likewise they are excessively hard on their children.<p>Donald Trump has been, likely out of human survival necessity, creating his own fantasy reality in his mind from a very young age.  And frankly, with enough self delusion, one can truly believe anything.  He appears to truly believe he was cheated, and that he has always been cheated.  Ironically, the facts visible from the outside indicate that he is usually the one cheating others (&quot;university&quot; students, debtors, investors, constituents, etc.).<p>He is doomed, whether by New York State attorneys for his property tax cheats, or perhaps his inflated property sales (foreign money laundering), or other crimes.  But more significantly, he is doomed because his character and behavior guarantees that he will never get the satisfaction and confirmation that he has been needing his entire life.  It&#x27;s actually quite sad.  But frankly he is old, and he has fucked so many people against their wishes, literally and figuratively, that I have no compassion at this point.  Let him burn, or drown in his own misery.<p>What is more disturbing is the mass of ignorant followers who have thrown their lives and families in turmoil because of him (and because of Fox News and its like).  Some of my elder family are in that category.  I remember them before this period, and I know they are ultimately good people; but somehow they need a serious readjustment.  To use the really tired, annoying expression, they need to become &quot;woke&quot;.<p>Social media better get a grip.  It has a very difficult job, because there is no clear line where free speech becomes excessively false rhetoric and disinformation.  But it does occur at some point, and it absolutely gets leveraged by groups with agendas.  We have ample evidence of how social media has been used at least since 2015 by Russian-related groups to destabilize &quot;democracies&quot; (in quotes now because what was once believe to be a democracy has now been shown to be more of a &quot;democracy as long as it doesn&#x27;t includes stuff that really bothers us&quot;).<p>I see no easy solution here.  The best solution is broader education, more travel and experience, and more connections with people outside our own little bubbles.  But that&#x27;s not going to happen.  At this point I&#x27;m not willing to bet whether an environmental disaster or a geopolitical disaster will end human life first.<p>As for Donald Trump, I pity him and wish him to have exactly what he has now.  Lots of stolen or debt-forgiven wealth, women who never want him for him, horrible golf skills, and tiny hands.  Farewell.')
