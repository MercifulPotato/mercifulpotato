One can&#x27;t live forever, and IMHO prioritizing younger people for medical care is widely accepted. Of course there needs to be a few humans in the loop as it&#x27;s just a statistic and there are no guarantees.<p>And obviously a cold soulless robot AI optimizing for it would be insane, but that goes for most metrics.')
