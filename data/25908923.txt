Item(by='Natsu', descendants=None, kids=[25909855], score=None, time=1611608896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908319, text='&gt; Does brazil have a 50c army like china now?<p>If it does, I didn&#x27;t get my 50 Mao cents for posting.  And you&#x27;d think China would support the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Worker&#x27;s Party) ideologically, but it&#x27;s their Mao cents, not mine.<p>Lula was convicted twice, he only got freed from jail because of a new legal ruling that said that you can&#x27;t be jailed until all appeals have been heard.  That&#x27;s... not the same as &quot;no convictions&quot; even if you want to claim the judges were both biased.<p>And I&#x27;m not aware of anyone accusing Lula of being a pedophile, though maybe someone did?  Everything I remember hearing blamed him for robbing Petrobras.  You sure you&#x27;re not getting Lula confused with &quot;Jo√£o de Deus&quot;?  I thought he was the one who was raping people.')
