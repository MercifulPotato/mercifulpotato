In the first section:<p>&gt;But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some &quot;lunches lost&quot; that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.<p>This is more about how the compilation process is working to both help people understand how to write optimal code and to understand what optimizing compilers need in order to work. The engineering trade-offs, like slow performance of globals, errors in functions that would change types, etc. are all demonstrated. If you read a full description of the engineering trade-offs and think that it&#x27;s a marketing tool, then you must think it made the right trade-offs? I don&#x27;t understand why that would be bad.')
