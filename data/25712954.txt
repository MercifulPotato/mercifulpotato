They are actively planning another attempt as we speak.<p>You are defending a group of people that has shown they are intolerant, violent, and unrepentant.<p>Nobody is saying they can&#x27;t sit around and drink beers at home at talk about burning down the capitol, they are just saying you can&#x27;t do it on their infrastructure.<p>This is no different than when everyone was banning ISIS a few years ago.
