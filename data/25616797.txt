I think they are pointing out that for many developers, moving to Python 3 happened very late. That means they ran 2.7 since 2010 (roughly 10 years now.) Now that they are on 3.x, they get issues with each new 3.x release.<p>The argument is that being on 2.7 for so long gave a false impression of the language being more stable than it is - developers just weren&#x27;t using new versions.')
