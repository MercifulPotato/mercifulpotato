Send the satellites off, 20 minutes of light-speed away, and use the big gap as a cache.<p>Seems sorta feasible to me, but I guess I&#x27;m overlooking some ridiculously obvious factor, such as launch costs, viability, etc.  But really, seems like a fleet of satellites spread out around the solar system could function as quite a nice medium ..')
