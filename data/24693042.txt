Item(by='tabbott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601939202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24687458, text='I&#x27;ve been using the Altwork (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;altwork.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;altwork.com&#x2F;</a>) desk for this purpose since January, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants this sort of thing.  It was expensive (~$7K), but I needed it due to a medical condition that makes extended sitting difficult for me, and it&#x27;s made a big difference in my ability to work despite this condition.<p>The workstation is awesome technology; it&#x27;s really well built, nicely runs wires everywhere, etc.  My only complaint is that the headrest is too hard to be lying down on it for hours at a time -- I fixed that by putting an old sweater between my head and the headrest, which made it perfectly comfortable for me.  One thing that might not be obvious is that it takes up surprisingly little space -- something like 4&#x27; x 6&#x27;.<p>Talking to them about the delivery, a lot of their customers are other folks with medical reasons to want it, because I think that&#x27;s what justifies the price point for people.  But the price will come down with scale (there&#x27;s already a $4K model: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;altwork.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;flex-altwork-station?variant=34559067717781" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;altwork.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;flex-altwork-station?variant=34...</a>).  And at that price point, the price is immaterial compared to software salaries, at least if you think about it as a capital item that will amortize over many years.')
