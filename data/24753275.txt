The occupation of a lawyer or a doctor professes some privileges but also creates <i>legal</i> liabilities. As a lawyer or a doctor, you&#x27;re not going to risk losing your license over an advice or procedure given to someone for free, on a hobby project.<p>(Also, the work of lawyers and doctors isn&#x27;t creative in the sense software is, but it&#x27;s primarily a people-oriented service. Which means you need other people to do your primary type of work for&#x2F;on. The kind of work lawyers&#x2F;doctors usually do after hours is called <i>research</i>, or just <i>learning</i>. Meanwhile, in software development, I can do the exact same type of work for myself that I do at my job, and end up with a digital product I can enjoy using.)')
