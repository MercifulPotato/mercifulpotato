It&#x27;s actually covered by a really great book called &quot;Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion&quot; [0]<p>Anchoring comes in many forms (and in asking questions like a survey should be carefully avoided) but one such form is when a person is shopping and being helped by a store clerk:<p>You&#x27;re looking for a nice dress watch. Mentally, maybe you&#x27;re hoping to spend around $300. You ask the clerk to show you some watches. They bring you to a $2000, very nice watch, but that&#x27;s far more than you wanted to spend. So, next, they bring you to a $500, also very nice watch. Your expectations have already been anchored to a $2000 price tag, to this second model, at a quarter of the price, seems like a really great deal. You think maybe your $300 target was actually too low for what you&#x27;re looking for, and perhaps spend the higher price.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini&#x2F;dp&#x2F;006124189X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Rober...</a>')
