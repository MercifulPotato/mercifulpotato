The fact we&#x27;ve heard about it is because those doing it got caught. Indeed, talking about the US in particular, many of those stories originate in an unclassified letter the NSA Inspector-General sent to Senator Chuck Grassley back in 2013, which the Senator released to the public – the fact that the Inspector-General knew about the cases means those people got caught somehow.<p>Some complain that the Three Letter Agencies are too soft on the perpetrators – a reprimand, a demotion&#x2F;paycut, a forced resignation, or termination instead of criminal prosecution – but going soft isn&#x27;t the same thing as approval. (Also, the agencies themselves don&#x27;t have authority to prosecute, the most they can do is send a referral to the prosecutor but it is up to the prosecutor to decide whether to proceed.) Given how much emphasis those agencies put on staff reliability, getting caught doing stuff like that is a pretty serious career-limiting move.<p>I reckon those agencies – and the prosecutors too – care a lot more about employees stealing bitcoin from targets than they do about employees spying on their neighbours or love interests. Bureaucrats always care about money; and thefts are more straightforward cases to prosecute than LOVEINT.')
