You can see this in multiple ways, legislative, executive and judicial divisions, but also state vs federal. I would argue that government vs business vs the populace is another unstated but extremely important one. Given that the right of free speech is one of the primary tools both business and the populace use to regulate government I would argue that it&#x27;s not worth loosening its protections. We already have plenty of tools to deal with excess business power already if we can get both government and the populace on board.')
