I have a neglected web property that has a small cult-like following of a few thousand members.  It&#x27;s a photo sharing community for a specific subject, with a moderator and community ratings and things like that.<p>I&#x27;ve had plans to take this property and use it as a proof of concept for a platform that will enable anyone to create this kind of photo sharing community.  Kind of like a wordpress for photo sharing communities.<p>I&#x27;m currently busy with other projects, but If I can find the right person that can take my vision and run with it, I&#x27;d be willing to throw some serious resources into this.<p>I&#x27;m basically looking for a full-stack developer who can also do product development, OR a designer who can handle the product development and work with a remote developer.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, email me at gregg@webstartup.com and tell me a bit about yourself, or reply here for any questions.')
