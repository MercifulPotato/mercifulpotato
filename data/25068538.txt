But you&#x27;re not. You&#x27;re just &quot;appearing&quot; in threads to plug you project. It&#x27;s not a side-effect of your comment, it&#x27;s the entirety of your comment. Hence &quot;appear &gt; plug&quot; instead of just &quot;plug&quot;.<p>And no, I&#x27;m not in charge of what&#x27;s OK, just telling you that people are starting to see your constant, unrelated plugging as spam.<p>And yes, it is (currently) vaporware, no matter how long time it takes to build it. Why is it vaporware? You&#x27;re advertising something that currently no one can use and their is no concrete information about it. When someone asks what it is, you ask them what they want. You don&#x27;t even seem to know what the project you&#x27;re building is yet.')
