I generally understand Pine64 products to be developed to the point that they are capable of being used by end-users from day one without hacking or fiddling, are basically ready-to-order in the same way as any commercicial product but with a general understanding that they were hacked together, and may require the kind of hacking that only enthusiasts are interested in doing over the medium to long term. To my mind that is enough to elevate it above junk (are there other distributors comparable to Pine64 that I don&#x27;t know about?), and I feel that it&#x27;s quite strange that that should even have to be debated at all.<p>&gt;while genuine Huami goes on to collect data more strategically at a larger scale.<p>You&#x27;re saying that as though it&#x27;s a good thing, which I don&#x27;t understand.<p>&gt;Gives me different chills than the fact that its sole purpose is to take my health data anyway.<p>I also couldn&#x27;t parse this.')
