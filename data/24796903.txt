The place where the woman was trying to cross is where a paved path leads from a beach, and then just suddenly ends at this road. The only reason it was illegal to cross the road here is because they put up a sign. In the absence of the sign, every architectural feature of this landscape would lead a reasonable person to believe they could be here.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@33.4365905,-111.9426898,3a,75y,214.49h,90t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGmI-XGwfzm2T_G8UX7Kc3g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@33.4365905,-111.9426898,3a,75y,...</a>')
