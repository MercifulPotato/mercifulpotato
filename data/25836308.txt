I am also saving tons on money from: gas, lunches, road tolls.<p>* Not spending a business day on the road each week dodging maniacs means I am less tired and distracted at work time.<p>* I can spend more time with my kids.<p>* My house is quiet during the day. I can focus on doing work. If there is no work assigned then work on a personal project or complete maintenance on the house.')
