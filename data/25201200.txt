I’m seriously considering jumping off the UniFi bandwagon due to their mounting technical debt. UniFi seems to be stuck on MongoDB 3.4 and Java 8.  I can live with that, even though it’s a sign that their developers are not keeping up. The straw that’s about to break the camel’s back that that they’re stuck on an old version of dropbear. The latest OpenSSH refuses to negotiate public key auth with it because the old dropbear doesn’t support modern signature algorithms.<p>(Yes, I know how to override OpenSSH’s config for this.  No, I shouldn’t have to.)')
