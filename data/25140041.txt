Mobile games are a huge business and Apple takes 30% of that revenue.<p>So why would an energy efficient ARM chip suddenly make a gaming console of interest to Apple? Both Playstation and Xbox are X86 PC hardware. Apple could have just used x86 years earlier, but they didn&#x27;t. Why? Because that&#x27;s not their market.<p>Sales of consoles are driven by price, and the game portfolio. I have yet to meet a consumer who will be excited for a energy efficient console which costs more than the competitors and have almost no big titles.')
