Item(by='moksly', descendants=None, kids=[24762944], score=None, time=1602569118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762449, text='Interesting that it scored me as:\nESTP 0.993968\nISFP 0.003365\nENFJ 0.000944\nISTJ 0.000374\nINTJ 0.000271<p>Which is actually rather accurate to how I test. My work profile is ESTP, my private life profile is ISFP. The weights are obviously off, and my Reddit account is completely tied to my personal interests around blood bowl.<p>Either way, I’m surprised to see astrology for people who don’t believe in astrology on HN. I never fully understood HRs reliance on these tools, once you’ve taken a few, you can score exactly as you want to, but I’m truly surprised to see them on HN.')
