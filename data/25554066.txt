Pro provides twice the TBW value.<p>TBW is almost never a concern for desktop users. The Evo has 600 TBW endurance per TB of storage, that would be a full disk rewrite every day for two years.<p>You will never download enough Docker images for personal use to burn out your 860 Evo before you would have replaced it anyway. (For those unfamiliar with Docker, spinning up a 500MB image ten times doesn&#x27;t write 5GB to disk!)')
