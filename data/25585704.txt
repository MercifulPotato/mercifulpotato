Both guesses on suicides and domestic violence going up, people not going to doctor. But that does not matter, because people will do the rhetorical point anyway. In most context, people who bring up suicide did not even tried to find whether those guesses exists.<p>It is almost end of year, we have actual suicides statistics available. Suicides went slightly up, but not by much and they went slightly up in preceding years too. More people died from covid. Our best estimates say that if hospitals would get overfulled, in those places mortality would be even higher.<p>But that does not matter for &quot;what about&quot; political point. Because that one is not motivated by attempt to find best policy, it is motivated by wanting the other side to be wrong.')
