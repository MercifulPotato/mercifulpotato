On this view, nationalism is initially a curiously European phenomena and later spreads outward with the march of &quot;print-capitalism&quot;. I find this analysis much easier to square with the early modern history of Japan or China, for example.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Imagined_community" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Imagined_community</a>')
