I don&#x27;t think your analysis is accurate. To be exact the part about receiving emails inciting violence. I think there were no such emails, but they asked Salesforce did they do anything about potential future emails inciting violence.<p>Salesforce says yes. They probably either suspended the account or put in some kind of verification step where Salesforce needs to whiteflag the email to go forward. This was they can stop any potential email inciting violence, but still isn&#x27;t extremely damaging to the company.')
