I didn&#x27;t mention that the chronological list of events is drawn from a database filtered by time, location, person ect. (but yes, what is in the database? And if there is too much in the database, how do you filter it so it can be digested.)<p>Data goes into database by trusted people of some sort with something to lose if the data is misleading or inaccurate. Employees for a start, them something larger once the system is working. (Wikipedia &#x2F; Wikidata is not perfect, but it mostly works. )<p>There are other challenges like identifying interesting events of the day, and promoting them to be headlines.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect solution, but I&#x27;m interested in exploring possible solutions.')
