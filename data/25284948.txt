It&#x27;s a fundamental philosophical tenet of Urbit that there are fewer than four billion people in this world who are deserving of a &quot;proper identity that can&#x27;t be canceled.&quot; Urbit specifically exists to promote having an independent digital identity instead of being subservient to Facebook, Twitter, etc., but not everyone in the world is worthy of having that independent digital identity in Urbit&#x27;s eyes, and never will be.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not primarily arguing whether Urbit&#x27;s view is right or wrong - it&#x27;s probably clear that I mostly think Urbit&#x27;s view is wrong, but the primary argument I&#x27;m making is that Urbit encodes this particular view into its technical implementation. I&#x27;m definitely <i>not</i> arguing, for instance, that 8-year-olds deserve the same rights as 30-year-olds - but I am arguing that <i>it&#x27;s a legitimate position to say they do</i>, and that human society may, with good reason, come to that conclusion in the future. But Urbit has closed the door on that question. Sure, we live in a world right now where not all people have the same rights, and in particular children do not. But in a world where Urbit succeeds, there&#x27;s no point even debating the question, because not all people technically <i>can</i> have the same rights.')
