So the question becomes what history should one preserve, and here opinions can legitimately differ. What I would suggest, at minimum, is not allowing force pushes to master or any other branches that you consider as &quot;published&quot; (internally or externally) -- easy to enforce on basically any git hosting solution or via a server hook. However this is a completely orthogonal question to choosing a rebase or merge based workflow. If master moved from my local branch, and I do a merge of a feature branch and force push, upstream history will get lost (baring a copy in the reflog or elsewhere).')
