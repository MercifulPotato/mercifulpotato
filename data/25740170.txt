On reddit I explained that mayor Pete&#x27;s M4A wasn&#x27;t the same M4A as the world understood it. A user immediately responds accusing of me editing my comment to deceive. I say prove it you f#cking liar, there are services that archive. Then I&#x27;m hit with the ban for being profane and harassing. Yup, turns out the comment had been very quickly shadow-banned lol. I should have known. But this might inform people that its not only conservatives who&#x27;s speech is threatened; it&#x27;s anyone who speaks contrary to the mainstream.')
