Germans generally use cash or EC&#x2F;Maesto debit cards, and you can&#x27;t get an EC card if you&#x27;re not an EU resident with an EU bank account (which can be hard for Americans, and, to a lesser extent, any foreigner, I&#x27;m sure).<p>I used to have a Maestro-branded debit card (in the US) when I was younger. I have no idea if it&#x27;s the same system and&#x2F;or if they&#x27;re compatible. I checked my wallet and my current debit card has no Maestro branding.<p>I&#x27;ve more than once found myself halfway through a meal before realizing that I might not have a way to pay for it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.german-way.com&#x2F;germanys-cash-culture-geld-stinkt-nicht&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.german-way.com&#x2F;germanys-cash-culture-geld-stinkt...</a>')
