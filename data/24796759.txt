He committed to protecting Social Security and Medicare off the bat. (Remember Bush and Gore fighting over the “lock box?” Even fricking Sweden has partislly privatized their social security.) Even though it was right after Obergefell he said pretty much nothing about same-sex marriage. He criticized Clinton for her past criminal justice stances. Bluster aside, even his immigration platform wasn’t nuts. Liberal darling Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand became prime minister by campaigning on cutting legal immigration by half. Trump didn’t even do that. He focused on stopping illegal immigration, which 60% of Americans worry about: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.gallup.com&#x2F;origin&#x2F;gallupinc&#x2F;GallupSpaces&#x2F;Production&#x2F;Cms&#x2F;POLL&#x2F;jsvbhjewmuouk_wnzghzbq.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.gallup.com&#x2F;origin&#x2F;gallupinc&#x2F;GallupSpaces&#x2F;Pro...</a>.<p>His agenda also hasn’t been “radical.” What has he done? He has banned refugees and immigrants from certain countries—all ones you would expect given the political status, such as North Korea and Yemen. The only one on the current list that looks odd is Nigeria, but Trump instituted that ban at the same as the EU imposed Visa restrictions on Nigeria (February 2020): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schengenvisainfo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;eu-plans-to-impose-visa-restrictions-on-nigerians&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schengenvisainfo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;eu-plans-to-impose-vis...</a><p>He had a corporate tax cut, which is consistent with what the UK and Sweden had been doing, and Merkel suggested Germany follow suit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-davos-meeting-merkel-tax-idUSKBN1FD1X9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-davos-meeting-merkel-tax-...</a><p>He repealed a bunch of unpopular environmental regulations Obama pushed through in the last couple of years of his final term. This was after his 2012 campaign, where Obama criticized Romney for standing in front of a coal plant and saying “this kills.” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2012&#x2F;oct&#x2F;16&#x2F;barack-obama&#x2F;obama-says-romney-once-said-coal-burning-plant-kil&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2012&#x2F;oct&#x2F;16&#x2F;barack-oba...</a><p>&gt; Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills,’ and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you&#x27;re a big champion of coal,&quot; Obama said.<p>See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dfbc1aa17701ae219239caad0bfefb2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;5dfbc1aa17701ae219239caad0bfefb2</a><p>&gt; You wouldn’t always know it ,but it went up every year I was president,” he said to applause. “That whole, suddenly America’s like the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas that was me, people.”<p>So yeah, Obama waited until the last couple of years of his term to push through some unpopular environments rules such as changes to that would require farmers to get federal permits to drain ponds in their land, and things like that. And Trump repealed them just as easily. That’s what happens between administrations.<p>Then you had the First Step Act, which was a progressive step.<p>He appointed three justices who were prominent in conservative legal circles long before Trump came in the scene.<p>So what exactly about his agenda was “radical?” Even if he had succeeded in things like repealing the ACA, that would have taken us back to 2008? (And Trump genuinely didn’t want the total repeal option without any replacement. He was the one who crafted the repeal and replace idea, while previously republicans had just wanted to repeal.)')
