Im still at the point, where I&#x27;m learning to use my left and right hands independently and play without looking.<p>And that&#x27;s what SimplyPiano gets you to - it&#x27;s a structured program+game that teaches you to read music and gain hand independence using an app.<p>Im pretty self aware that I will need a teacher at some point. I have been a gamer and had formal teaching in music when I was kid.<p>I find it hard to believe that a teacher would be able to correct me in real time, while simultaneously having me enjoy the process. Once I start playing half decently, the memory of music is motivation enough.<p>Not right now.')
