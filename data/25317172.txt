The problem is not about network policies though, since DHCP is explicitly not designed to be a policy and is purposely meant to be optional for the client.<p>For this reason I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying a device like the Chromecast, in which the user can&#x27;t configure the network settings. Instead maybe consider something like the Amazon Fire Stick which is not as user-hostile.')
