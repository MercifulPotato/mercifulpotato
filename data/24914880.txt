YES - this exact same thing has driven me crazy.<p>&gt; Because of the inconsistency, I&#x27;ve become hesitant and scared to click anything for the first ten seconds of loading the page. I&#x27;m being habituated by negative stimulus. Nothing has ever made me want to ditch Google search more strongly because it&#x27;s now literally giving me anxiety to view the search results.<p>I resonate with this so much. It offends me in the worst way - it makes me waste my time. Not only when I search something, but on other places too! &quot;Will the content change before I click or not? I don&#x27;t know, so I better wait a few seconds&quot;. Even if a page is not an offender of doing this, I&#x27;ve already been conditioned into waiting.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating and it&#x27;s infuriating.
