IIRC a sum of around 25 deaths was attributed to all of the &quot;BLM protests&quot; last year, and I don&#x27;t recall any police deaths that weren&#x27;t eventually attributed to right-wing folks.<p>The events of this Wednesday, a single (what I would call) medium-sized protest, got 5 people killed including one policeman, right? So just in terms of the ratio of deaths to participator-days, I think this Wednesday&#x27;s event probably has last year&#x27;s protests beaten by at least two orders of magnitude in the loss of life department. Even if you take away the two people who didn&#x27;t die from the use of a weapon or a savage beating, I think they still got the high score by far.<p>To be sure, mob violence should be condemned wherever it appears. But in judging movements like these, I think it&#x27;s important to keep in mind a sense of proportionality, among other things.')
