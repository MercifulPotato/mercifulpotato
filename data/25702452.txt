Plus last year (2020 was truly shitty) I developed a frozen shoulder, which now prevents me from doing many exercises that used to help me. My other shoulder is starting to hurt too now, and Iâ€™m mentally preparing myself to having both shoulders frozen this year. \nI have been to many doctors, and had lots of tests (x-ray, MRI,ultrasound) but they cannot find anything. Doctors are mostly useless for things like this. They are only helpful when you have accidents with obvious broken or damaged bonuses and tissues etc.')
