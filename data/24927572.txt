If I don&#x27;t get any hint as to what kind of behavior the individual maintainers consider dickheadish, I have to worry about that with every interaction. If you have a CoC with even very vague and subjective rules, I at least know what kind of stuff you care about and then at worst I can be extra careful around that.<p>But knowing what&#x27;s in the CoC doesn&#x27;t actually tell you what kind of stuff the maintainer cares about. The maintainers will still block you if they consider you dickheadish, they&#x27;ll just find a reading of their CoC that lets them declare you a racist (or whatever) first.')
