The difference between 0 and 5% is an even sharper slope-- from infinity to 1200% of the population ;)<p>Also-- all we know about is effects on symptomatic illness and we can&#x27;t be sure there&#x27;s any large transmission benefit (and if there is, it&#x27;s probably smaller than the efficacy against symptomatic illness).<p>If the virus is still circulating in volume, the difference between a 95% effective vaccine and a 70% vaccine is a further 6x reduction in risk for the individuals that have it.  Every little bit helps, but a really high efficacy is very nice to have.')
