Doing profit sharing incentives for devs risks getting weird quickly.<p>-- It&#x27;s hard to measure contributions of a dev in a team of 5-10 (how much was them, another dev, the PM, the designer?) while pretty clear for say a sales + sales eng pair.<p>-- Likewise, there&#x27;s a danger of confusing incentivizes of having a dev make commission-based decisions, esp. when counter to what a PM needs to incentivize. in a sense, part of the PM&#x27;s job is to prevent sales&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;management from confusing the rest of the org!<p>For product orgs, some companies do incentives and promotions based on profit&#x2F;loss measurables (&quot;1% datacenter power savings =&gt; $10M&#x2F;yr savings =&gt; ...&quot;), I think team-based w&#x2F; some sort of hierarchy. Alternatively, Cisco  weird spin-in system worked well... for those liked by the involved leads.<p>When _not_ a product org and a more direct line to $, like a sales eng supporting sales, or a dev supporting a quant, easier to go commission&#x2F;profit-sharing based..')
