Item(by='em500', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606829570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264828, text='I think the wording is ambiguous enough that it takes an actual court case to resolve.<p>In a broad interpretation, the prohibitions on rent&#x2F;lease&#x2F;lend&#x2F;sell of &quot;the Apple Software&quot; would apply to the whole system (harware+software), which would forbid me to sell my old Mac. This would never hold up in court. But in a narrow reading, where the prohibitions only apply to the software, separated from the hardware it does not look like there is anything stopping me from renting out (access to) the entire Mac to a single user[1], for whatever purpose and duration I want. So those 24hr and &quot;development purposes&quot; would be moot.<p>[1] There&#x27;s probably more than enough precedence to uphold number-of-users restrictions of software, e.g. Windows Server CALs.')
