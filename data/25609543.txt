While still a very active research field, BD and any other places doing legs are much more concerned with mechanical - dynamics, actuators, battery, locomotion problems.<p>If you want to do some real work on those, pursuing grad school in Electrical (actuators, battery) &#x2F; Mechanical Engineering (legs, locomotion) is the best, and for the legged robots industry probably the only way (same goes for biomimetics - robot hands). The related research area encapsulating the above is called passive dynamics and primarily is a control theory-based field.')
