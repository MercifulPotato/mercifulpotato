This is a rather unnuanced way to describe it.<p>- Even the mysterious &quot;whistleblower&quot; email doesn&#x27;t strike me as very convincing.<p>- Insinuation that the site is penalized just because Cutts has ties to UrbanDictionary; which strikes me as unlikely.<p>Are parts of it true? Probably. The &quot;automated penalty&quot; probably is, but I wouldn&#x27;t phrase it like that myself. The rest? Meh.')
