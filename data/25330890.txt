As @schoen already replied, it is only used by CA&#x27;s to check if they are allowed to issue a certificate to a domain.<p>But with DANE TLSA Resource Records you can pin a public key to a website. Alas the implementation of TLSA-RR checking in browsers is dependent on extensions at this time. I wish it was native in browsers with a big red sign when violated. When done in combination with DNSSEC it&#x27;s very hard to fake certificates. Or more precisely asymmetric cryptography key pairs used by servers. Certificates for TLS would not be needed anymore if TLSA-RR&#x27;s were standard practice. A company might still use a certificate to attest it&#x27;s identity beyond internet domain ownership.<p>Edit: This is for TLSA 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 records. That&#x27;s what I have experience with. Just read on Wikipedia a lot more is possible with TLSA-RR&#x27;s including certificate and CA pinning. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities#TLSA_RR" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DNS-based_Authentication_of_Na...</a>')
