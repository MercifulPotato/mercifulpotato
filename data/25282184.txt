But that&#x27;s for baseload power, which can&#x27;t replace batteries.   What&#x27;s needed is dispatchable or on-demand power, which costs about 3x as much for gas, I have no idea how much it inflates the price for nuclear, but the answer will be &quot;a lot&quot;.<p>Nuclear in 2020 doesn&#x27;t make any sense.   It&#x27;s far cheaper to over-provision and use storage.<p>We should have been building nuclear like crazy over the past 40 years.   Then it could have followed a similar learning curve that renewables did and it&#x27;d still make sense today.')
