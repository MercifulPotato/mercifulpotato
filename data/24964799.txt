It is one of the more inexpensive piston filled demonstrators out there. The writing experience is the best I&#x27;ve had so far (when paired with heavier Rhodia or Clairefontaine paper). The only downsides are (1) it uses a screw cap mechanism (which is preferred by some in the fountain pen community because it doesn&#x27;t fail like snap-on cap mechanisms; but is slower and less convenient) (2) It&#x27;s made of plastic -- very high quality plastic -- but plastic nonetheless. It&#x27;s more of a technological pen than a classic pen. That said, I would rate the writing experience of the TWSBI much higher than that of the more popular Pilot Metropolitan (I should know, I own 4 Pilot Metros).<p>Also, as much as I&#x27;m a fan of fountain pens, they do have some downsides. The ink tends to smear&#x2F;smudge easily (even quick drying ones) on normal paper, which makes them less suitable for scribbling marginalia on paperbacks. And even their extra fine nibs aren&#x27;t that fine, so one can&#x27;t squeeze as many words into the margins. Therefore, I use a different pen for marginalia: a Pilot Hi-Tec-C 0.3mm (~$3). It&#x27;s a gel pen with a very very fine nib (0.3mm is finer than Western F fountain nibs). Fountain pen inks are also usually water soluble so they&#x27;re less suitable for use cases that require permanence, like say signing the back of a credit card, so I find myself having to switch to a cheap ballpoint in such cases.<p>To me, fountain pens optimize for one experience and one experience only -- the pleasure of writing on good paper. It trades off versatility to achieve this optimization.')
