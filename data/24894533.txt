A client&#x27;s corporate Webex will call me when the meeting starts - that&#x27;s been great.  Another client&#x27;s zoom will send an invite with a clickable phone number <i>but</i> it doesn&#x27;t have the appended , and passcode on it, so I have to look that up and type (before the system thinks I&#x27;m not there) - super annoying.<p>It gives me the freedom to pace&#x2F;walk&#x2F;move without being tethered to the laptop&#x2F;desk&#x2F;screen.  Now... I often connect in there as well, so I can see any shared screen, but if I need to walk away for a bit (coffee&#x2F;etc) no one knows, but I can keep listening.  Muting myself on phone is easy too.<p>And yes, I&#x27;ve found it helps with some audio stuff too - often I&#x27;ll hear other people making comments about losing audio, or delays, but I <i>rarely</i> experience those when dialed in by phone.')
