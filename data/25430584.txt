I never claimed Python was more widely supported that Bash, in terms of this argument you should use neither, that&#x27;s the whole point.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that it does not make sense to use Bash over e.g. Python in favor of supporting a wider range of machines while at the same time limiting support to Bash environments when you could use POSIX instead which is a subset of Bash and therefore more widely supported than Bash and Python.<p>Do you have data to prove that POSIX shell less likely to be supported than Bash and Python respectively? Otherwise I don&#x27;t see how my argument is invalid.<p>Of course Bash support is larger than Python support (that&#x27;s what you seem to be saying), and therefore even a Bash-specific script is more portable. What I&#x27;m suggesting is that it&#x27;s contradictory to stop there when you could simply drop the bashisms and go for full POSIX compliance for even more portability.<p>That said, if I&#x27;m misunderstanding you, please point out how so.')
