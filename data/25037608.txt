It looks like they are going to completely botch pharmacare.<p>EDIT: I am getting downvoted, which is fair. I did not provide any context and assumed it was common knowledge. In his throne speech, Trudeau had this to say about pharmacare:<p>&gt; <i>The Government remains committed to a national, universal pharmacare program and will accelerate steps to achieve this system including:<p>- Through a rare-disease strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs;<p>-Establishing a national formulary to keep drug prices low;<p>-And working with provinces and territories willing to move forward without delay.</i><p>Essentially, the government will try to make drugs a tiny bit cheaper for consumers. It does not look the Pharmacare program is going to be universal and free, like the Medicare is. But perhaps your 2000$ per month drug price would come down to 1500$ per month, if you are below a certain income threshold, etc, etc. This is not nowhere near enough after Liberals promising Pharmacare for decades.')
