In exchange the HOA setup by the builder bans satellite dishes. In more annoying cases the HOA negotiates a group plan included in your HOA assessment bill; that really stifles competition because paying for an alternative on top of cable is irrational. The FCC banned satellite dish bans back in the 90s.<p>Apartment building operators still do this scam. The incumbent cable company will share revenue in exchange for the landlord refusing any competitor wiring.<p>Rent seeking in ISP markets is peanuts compared with zoning though. If real estate was much less supply constrained landlords would never fathom annoying a customer with inferior utilities.')
