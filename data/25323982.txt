Your future boss&#x27;s job will be to use your labor efficiently for the company. You may disagree with your boss on an assignment, in which case it would be wise to schedule some time and professionally discuss your concerns. Your boss may be persuaded, and good bosses will try their best, within reason, to keep their subordinates content with the work they&#x27;re doing.<p>However, at the end of the day, the boss may disagree with your points and still require you to do the job as assigned. If you refuse, you will likely be fired. Note that you also have agency here: If you don&#x27;t like the work the boss makes you do, and you feel like your concerns are consistently falling on deaf ears, you can quit.')
