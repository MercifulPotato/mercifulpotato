I&#x27;m not commenting from the sidelines, I lost Flash as a development platform too. I think my big frustration is that there&#x27;s this tone that often comes up underneath threads like this that&#x27;s, &quot;look what the web took away from us&quot;, and I just think that&#x27;s really harmful and inaccurate.<p>All of the APIs that are necessary to replicate Flash exist. The only failure of the Open web was assuming that the games industry was going to be competent enough to author new accessible tools. Heck, I was critical of Flash deprecation at the time, but even I thought that Adobe was eventually going to seamlessly export to HTML5. I don&#x27;t know what to say beyond that. On behalf of HTML5 advocates everywhere, I&#x27;m sorry we thought Adobe might be a competently run company.<p>So I wish more of these kinds of threads were subtweeting people like Tim Sweeney, or Unity devs, or Adobe itself, rather than trying to blame the web for what is arguably one of its biggest success stories: the evolution from being only suitable for toy interactions into a generally accessible application runtime. The web <i>succeeded</i> at that, beyond almost everyone&#x27;s expectations.<p>Almost everything that the web can provide to replace Flash it is providing. But web advocates can&#x27;t build an IDE. Somebody in the games industry has to do that. So maybe those people should be the target of this ire instead of HTML5. I get why people are frustrated, but web advocates can&#x27;t fix any of this. Somebody who builds game engines needs to fix it, the industry needs to actually make tools.<p>Like, to be kind of blunt, I wish people would stop criticizing the web for the problems that the games industry created.')
