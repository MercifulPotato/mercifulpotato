Maybe you’re right that it’s not terribly surprising. But I didn’t even kind of suggest that “math” has a “causal role”. I made another comment higher up relating how the way I think is another set of approximations and abstractions of reality. My point was far from saying that there’s some “truth” in math, quite the opposite.')
