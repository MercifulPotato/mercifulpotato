Businesses typically only list their opening hours on the door and then those are prone to change without notice. Planned to go somewhere for lunch and needed to check in to a train station in an hour, turns out the lunch place decided today they open half an hour late so I had to quickly rush somewhere else.<p>If google could deploy that tech demo that calls a business on public holidays to check if they are open, that would be amazing.')
