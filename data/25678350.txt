It&#x27;s a little bit expensive but the design is incredible. You also get Apple+ for a year. Apple haters will nag about having only one door when everyone else has at least two. MacRumors says that iCar Pro will have two doors and a hatch.<p>What I don&#x27;t like is that I must use expensive Apple wheels, and even the smallest repairs must be handled in  Apple shop. For some, the home charging station (wireless of course) is a deal-breaker. It costs almost as much as the car itself.<p>(small print): Commercial users like Uber and Lyft must pay 20% extra commission to Apple Store.')
