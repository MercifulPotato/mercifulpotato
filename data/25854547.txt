Not right-leaning old people at all.<p>&gt; They demand more deference be given to traditional tribespeople over and above the progression of cities.<p>I think you mean &quot;they think that Maori shouldn&#x27;t be fucked over by the government more than they already have been&quot;.<p>&gt; No one stands in the way of housing more than the left in this country.<p>Frankly, housing in NZ is not a political issue, it&#x27;s an economic one. Regardless of your politics, no one in the middle class is willing to fix the housing crisis, because it will mean a lot of economic pain.<p>Also, as much as I would like to see housing sorted in NZ, I also don&#x27;t want it to ruin what&#x27;s good about this country. If you want an example of how to ruin an area with building, look at Queenstown.')
