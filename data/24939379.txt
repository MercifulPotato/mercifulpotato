Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604034822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24938857, text='Sorry, that&#x27;s not going to work.  The comment you responded to outright said these things:<p>- &quot;MDN isn&#x27;t yours.&quot;<p>- &quot;Do they owe you something?&#x27;<p>- &quot;You&#x27;re not owed anything.&quot;<p>... and your response?  &quot;Legally, no&quot;—but of course the problem with that response, again, is that <i>legally, yes; they do owe something</i>.<p>So try rewriting the context and all the rhetorical gerrymandering you want, but it doesn&#x27;t change that the fact that (a) there <i>was</i> a discussion in terms of legal responsibilities and (b) in that discussion about those responsibilities, your comments were incorrect.  Being wrong because of a slip-up is fine—and it wasn&#x27;t even wholly your slip-up; you were <i>yes-and</i>ing someone else&#x27;s comment.  But this scrambling now to double down after it&#x27;s pointed out and the subsequent projection—particularly in your last paragraph here—is more than a little annoying to encounter.<p>&gt; The project doesn&#x27;t owe the contributors anything legally in terms of recognition<p>... except they do, for the reasons already stated.  Maybe there&#x27;s some attempt at sleight of hand in your choice of the word &quot;recognition&quot; here (i.e., as distinct from &quot;attribution&quot;, but even then, it&#x27;s not clear whether any argument there, if there is one, would even hold up)—but it&#x27;s not really important.  Because &quot;attribution&quot; is the word that was used, attribution is what the BY part of CC-BY-SA stands for, and attribution is what&#x27;s required by that license—yes, legally.<p>It&#x27;s pretty bewildering that you think you have an argument here.')
