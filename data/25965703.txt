The experts have their ideas, but there is no way to be sure.<p>One problem is optimal needs to consider the real world, not the ideal world.  West Virgina (typically the butt of backwards people jokes) has done more vaccinations per capita than any other state even though their allocation per capita is the same as other states.  This is because that state has decided that the optimal strategy is getting vaccines in arms, not ensuring it is the ideal arms: by not having the overhead of checking eligibility they can give their doses faster which is better than a slower pace of only getting the vaccine into the right people.<p>Note, I simplified West Virgina&#x27;s strategy, it is more complex.  Just less complex than other states.')
