It quite certainly would have been a potential massive blocker on quality, from satellite to surface.  Film seemed to solve that aspect of things in those early days.<p>I found this highly interesting.  Film, from multiple lenses, the ultimate sneaker net (yes, it&#x27;s analog, but still...)<p>Anyhow, over the years I&#x27;ve seen so many technical issues overcome, with sideways attacks on the problem.  When people start saying &quot;But... impossible!&quot;, I tend to have a high degree of skepticism.<p>I will say this though.  Yes, it certainly <i>could</i> have been propaganda.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean it was, but I certainly do agree the potential is there.')
