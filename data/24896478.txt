I&#x27;m very happy to acknowledge my privilege, but I&#x27;d have to push back if someone was asking me to declare that I&#x27;m racist. I&#x27;m also happy to hear about times I was unintentionally so, but to lump me into the same boat as the people that were screaming in my face that I&#x27;m a race traitor for holding a black lives matter sign doesn&#x27;t feel fair.')
