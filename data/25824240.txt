I replied to that comment with &quot;The article does not make such claims&quot;, to clarify that -- although X may have happened -- the article does not claim it did. At this point you said &quot;Depends on interpretation&quot;, as if the article could be interpreted to claim that X happened. You explained that one might interpret &quot;secured area&quot; to mean area accessible only to staff. That&#x27;s a plausible interpretation, I guess.<p>&gt; I considered &quot;secured area&quot; to be non public areas as opposed to &quot;place people wait to board flights after security&quot;<p>Nitpicks:<p>The place where people wait to board flights after security <i>is</i> a non public area (it is restricted from the public; you can not enter that area unless you have a special permission to be in that area).<p>The area where this man lived was apparently the arrivals area (not the departure area that you&#x27;re talking about). The arrivals area is also a non public area.')
