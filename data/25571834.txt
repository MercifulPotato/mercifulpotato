All 10 of them (including myself) got covid, and we all agree it is no worse than the flu. I mean, yeah, we couldn&#x27;t smell or taste for a few days, but we all recovered within a week. Therefore... I should reflexively question covid studies saying how dangerous it is because in my own experience it&#x27;s not even worth making a fuss over?<p>Maybe to some degree, but the fallacy I committed by relying on my anecdote to guide my intuition is that me and all my friends are young, fit, healthy people. My group of friends didn&#x27;t include the elderly or immunocompromised or morbidly obese, etc.')
