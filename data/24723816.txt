None of that is new, some of it is <i>very</i> old indeed. In my day we just referred to it as the &quot;New World Order.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s new is how QAnon packaged and rebranded these disparate bigotries into a single narrative with Donald Trump as the messiah and made it viral, likely on the back of the general alt-right and neo-reactionary surge of support within Trump&#x27;s base. But it wouldn&#x27;t have taken off at all if that wellspring of hate in America&#x27;s core hadn&#x27;t been there to tap, and there weren&#x27;t already plenty of people who would have found the general premise of, say, Hillary Clinton drinking the blood of child sex slaves, to be reasonable to begin with. You don&#x27;t convince people to believe that sort of thing who aren&#x27;t already halfway there.')
