I use the Samsung CRG9 which I originally bought for gaming. Interestingly I found it to be subpar for gaming (game huds are typically glued to the left and right of the screen, which is so far in your peripheral it&#x27;s effectively useless on the screen), but I found it amazing for productivity.\nHaving 4 windows side by side has made development so easy. I can have Figma &#x2F; VS Code &#x2F; Chrome &#x2F; terminals all open side by side. It means I almost never have to do window management, whereas with a lot of the apple displays I still find myself only having 2 windows up at once. The DPI leaves some things to be desired, but for real estate it&#x27;s been unmatched for me.')
