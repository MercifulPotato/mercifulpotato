No other reason.  It might be: 1) too small of a stepper motor, so it can not deliver sufficient torque for maximum load, 2) too small of a driver that can not deliver the current needed for the motor to reach its rated torque, 3) software bug that tries to accelerate the motor faster than it is capable of under the load at hand, 4) software bug that throttles the driver.<p>They all boil down to commanded torque greater that the system is capable of delivering.  Fix your design.  Be suspicious of software trying to accelerate too aggressively under load.<p>I have cut a lot of metal on a Tormach PCNC 1100 Series 3 machine, with steppers.  NEVER had an issue.  Correctly designed stepper systems DO NOT miss steps.<p>That said, servos systems typically are capable of greater accelerations for a motor of a give volume and current load, because of the closed-loop control.  Use servos for speed, not because you are afraid of skipped steps from a stepper.')
