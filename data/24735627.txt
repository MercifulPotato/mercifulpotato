What goes on in relational algebra is that the FROMCLAUSE is encoded into an axiomatic primitive called a RELATION and you get stuff like this:<p><pre><code>   SELECTCLAUSE(WHERECLAUSE(relation)) = relation\n   WHERECLAUSE(SELECTCLAUSE(relation)) = relation\n</code></pre>\nBasically every operation in relational algebra produces a primitive of type RELATION which allows for all operations to be composed like unix pipes.<p>My example in the previous post has a flaw where it&#x27;s not clear what:<p><pre><code>   SELECTCLAUSE * WHERECLAUSE = ????\n</code></pre>\nwill output because there&#x27;s no meaning to a SQLEXPRESSION without a FROMCLAUSE. But hopefully it illustrates the point. I&#x27;m putting this here for anyone who&#x27;s nitpicky about the details. The relational algebra syntax is much more elegant.')
