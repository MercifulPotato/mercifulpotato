Item(by='eythian', descendants=None, kids=[25398342], score=None, time=1607782167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397037, text='&gt; &quot;a lovely old little green rectangular French silver whittling knife&quot;<p>As a native speaker, but without any editorial training, this feels slightly off to me. My first edit would be something like &quot;a lovely little old&quot;, because &quot;lovely little&quot; feels like it should go together. Whether that&#x27;s due to alliteration or &quot;little old lady&quot; being a not uncommon phrase, I couldn&#x27;t say for sure.')
