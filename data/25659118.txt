I noticed the other day I went to a big electronics store (Mediamarkt) and noticed that my cellular connection died just as I entered the store. When asking about it, they told me the reception is just so poor there so I should use their WiFi instead. As I wanted to compare products with other stores, I used the WiFi.<p>But afterwards I started thinking, is it possible to store is doing this on purpose, in order to ex-filtrate data via the WiFi connection? They wouldn&#x27;t get more than the hostname if it&#x27;s over https, but who knows what more kind of data they could get from it. They could also block websites of competitors and blame the internet, and prevent consumers from comparing themselves.<p>Or I&#x27;m just a conspiracy-nut lite, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me a lot if it was like that.')
