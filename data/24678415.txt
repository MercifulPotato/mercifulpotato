I used to talk to lots of people in the office from many various teams and backgrounds. Now I only talk to my lead and a handful of others.<p>Work drags on every day and feels inhuman. It never &quot;ends&quot; now. I don&#x27;t find any joy or satisfaction in it. I hate this, and I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can put up with it.<p>I don&#x27;t even use our product. The thing that kept me happy and productive was the other people. Now that&#x27;s gone.<p>I need a sabbatical. WFH is awful. I&#x27;m so burnt out.')
