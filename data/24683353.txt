Why aren&#x27;t problems visible?<p>Can you actually see the almost complete failure of garbage disposal and recycling in your community? You cannot, because the failure doesn&#x27;t happen there (mostly), and because most of us are not interested enough to ask (or research) the questions we would need to in order to understand how badly the people tasked with taking care of this have screwed it up.<p>&gt; 2. Why don&#x27;t people &quot;act on [lack of transparency] and actually vote&quot;?<p>Right now, I live in a mostly rural county in New Mexico. Before that, I lived right on the edge of Philadelphia, 300 yards outside the city line but closer to downtown than most of the city. I&#x27;ve lived in lots of other places too, both in the US and Europe, even Israel. In all of those places, a local vote is vote for someone who will be extremely constrained by the status quo and the larger political entities the surround us. So sure, I could vote for someone who might take some steps to improve a particular aspect of how the county&#x2F;city&#x2F;town&#x2F;village deals with this or that, but it will always be taking place within the context of legislative, economic, energetic and social forces that are much, much harder to change. This can make it challenging to see the virtue of local elections, and thus to care about them in a way the reflects the extent to which we do actualy care about our communities.')
