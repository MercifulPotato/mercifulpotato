You have your little individual corner of the internet: a personal website on a VPS; your personal space to use however you deem fit. People can listen to or ignore you as they please. There is no higher authority playing arbiter, filtering, controlling your little space, who can visit it, who can&#x27;t. People can avoid your personal space if they wish, but they cannot shut down or destroy it.<p>And an RSS feed was and <i>still is</i> a great way to deliver and receive messages&#x2F;updates from someone&#x27;s personal corner of the internet. I wish it were more fashionable. But part of the reason it&#x27;s not fashionable is because it&#x27;s not profitable, financially, socially, or politically.<p>Other issues include the technical barrier to getting started with a personal site, and discoverability. I&#x27;d like to see more federated search engines to solve the discoverability issue.<p>So yes, it could be an opportunity for RSS to shine, but it won&#x27;t catch on.')
