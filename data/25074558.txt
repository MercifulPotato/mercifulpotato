One that includes lots of dependencies similar to &quot;npm&quot;, wants &quot;docker style&quot; local development, and the devs seem to think dependency-management is hard and you need complicated &quot;semantic&quot; versioning and version operators... but really it&#x27;s just because they&#x27;re working in a complex ecosystem of microservices.<p>But, for the other 99% projects though: Most of their dependencies won&#x27;t break compatibility, you&#x27;ll never uncover a hard version dependency that the package manager can&#x27;t solve, you&#x27;ll never need to &quot;freeze&quot; your dependency versions and you can pretty much just rely on a semi-persistent environment with all your necessary packages installed and semi-regularly updated. Essentially smooth-sailing.')
