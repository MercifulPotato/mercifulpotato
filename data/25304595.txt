Buckle up!<p>* 1-based indexing is superior to 0-based indexing.<p>* If you use spaces to indent code, or in any way rely on a fixed width font to &quot;line things up&quot;, you have a fundamental misunderstanding.<p>* Relatedly, the 80 column &quot;rule&quot; is as stupid in code as it would be in prose. Use your aesthetic sense.<p>* Vim and Emacs both have terrible user interfaces, and are an inferior experience to even a normal text editor let alone a decent IDE. Users have Stockholm Syndrome.<p>* For beginners, BASIC is great and Python is terrible.<p>* There are many languages with a &#x27;mystique&#x27;, like Lisp and APL. The correlation between &#x27;mystique&#x27; and practical utility is inverse.<p>* Source code should liberally use Unicode symbols.<p>* Sigils to indicate variable type are actually pretty great, especially if enforced by the compiler. (See above regarding BASIC)<p>Let the flames begin!')
