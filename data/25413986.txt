Like you said, we&#x27;d have to massively redo infrastructure on a huge level to see any penetration beyond luxury alternative use. If we&#x27;d start to also see increased carbon taxes or various efforts to reduce climate change, both vehicle and infrastructure might become even more expensive and more of a luxury.<p>Plus, it seems as a culture we are just wasting the productivity gains from increased technology and automation and dumping the value into money games; eventually i expect electric cars will be moot because there won&#x27;t be enough jobs or job creation to sustain enough of a middle class to afford them.')
