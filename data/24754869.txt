People with oversized vehicles and who rent spots normally park astrive the line, not across at 45.  That is done by someone who doesn&#x27;t want anyone near his car.  And even if this guy has rented two spots, that is still being a jerk to all the other people who want to rent&#x2F;use spots.<p>Do that around my town and you will find motorcycles parked in the triangles you have left behind.  I saw a porsche guy call the cops about this while at starbucks.
