Item(by='dathinab', descendants=None, kids=[25779519], score=None, time=1610645081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773780, text='&gt; weed is not even close to the most purchased drug via the dark web<p>I can only agree on this.<p>Sure different parts of Germany differ in their handling of weed but I don&#x27;t think anyone in Berlin bothers buying weeds from the dark web. I mean it&#x27;s just way to easy to get weed from other sources, which don&#x27;t require any online payment and by asking frequent weed consumers in your environment you have a better shot at getting good quality weed.<p>But while this is the case for weed it&#x27;s much less so for other drugs, mainly due to the police being very lax on weed but less so on many other drugs.')
