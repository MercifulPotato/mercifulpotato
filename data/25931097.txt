Punishing those people that have self control seems ridiculous and I hate sin taxes for that reason. However, I think putting restrictions on stuff for younger people that don&#x27;t have fully developed brains seems perfectly reasonable. If you&#x27;re under 18 (21 in some cases) you cannot drink, smoke etc. Social Media should be treated the same way.<p>Unfortunately, laws can only do so much with out invading the privacy of citizens so it&#x27;s really going to take a large campaign similar to anti-smoking ads in the 90s to get the message out about the cons and parents will HAVE to put their foot down. Although, it seems like a certain portion of our society thinks children should be allowed to make decisions themselves nowadays so I expect backlash at the thought of parents actually stopping their kids from harming themselves.')
