There have been a number of other recent events with app developers brought to light, like the exorbitant fees and kicking major companies off the app store.<p>We, as the collective developers and software engineers, are the main supporters of open-source, why do we continue to support and use Apple?<p>So I ask HN, to ask ourselves:\nWhy are we all fiercely supporting open-source when building on Apple?<p>Apple, who is know for their proprietary, closed source, closed hardware, walled garden app store, dongle crafting - charger not even included company.<p>Apple is no longer open-source friendly.
