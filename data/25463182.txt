I love exploring the little corners of the internet, but haven&#x27;t been exploring around as much in the past 10 years.<p>I really appreciate the History portion.  If I recall right, StumbleUpon with the toolbar didn&#x27;t save to history quite right, so I had a tough time getting back to a page after getting click happy.  Down the line, liking&#x2F;categorizing&#x2F;personalized suggestions would be really nice, but I might be too reminiscing about StumbleUpon too much.  :)<p>I remember setting the Stumble button to Alt+F11.  Those two keys were smooth without any markings remaining after a couple years.')
