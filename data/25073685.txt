The economic priorities of &quot;big problems&quot; or &quot;small problems&quot; doesn&#x27;t enter the picture <i>once a product is shipped.</i><p>I completely agree that a FAANG company would choose to prioritize big problems over small, but the essence of tech these days is how casually they might solve a problem, kill off any startups that might have also been pursuing that problem, and then discard their solution some time later with no regard for the users of that solution or acknowledging the dead startups that didn&#x27;t have the resources (or will) to compete.<p>Because a product they have shipped no longer serves <i>the company&#x27;s interests</i> does not mean it no longer serves the user&#x27;s interest. And yet these companies casually kill off these things without regard to the impact it has on those users. That lack of empathy, that focus on what is good for the company and company employee&#x27;s who focus on what is good for them, is the narcissism here.')
