Very simplified example below:<p>If I&#x27;m an airline (and my business is dependent on the price of oil) and I think the price of oil will go up, I will hold some amount of oil futures at the current price. If the price of oil rises, my company is &quot;hedged&quot; against that rise. This is good for the buyer of the commodity. If the price of oil goes down, I lose on my future, but my business is fine overall.<p>Correspondingly, if I&#x27;m the seller of a commodity (I own an oilfield), I might short oil futures, in case the price goes down. I make less money selling my oil, but I hopefully make some back on the short')
