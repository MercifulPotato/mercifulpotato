Item(by='tosh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604927030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034292, text='&gt; TLS 1.3 is a recent version in a series of TLS protocol standards [i.6] and [i.3]. TLS 1.3 [2] introduces several significant changes compared with TLS 1.2 [1]. One of these changes is the removal of support for RSA key exchange and static Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The primary key exchange mechanism in TLS 1.3 is ephemeral Diffie-Hellman. Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman prevents passive decryption of TLS 1.3 sessions at any scale. However, there are operational circumstances where passive decryption of TLS sessions by authorized entities is a requirement. The decryption may need to be performed in real-time, or the packets may need to be stored and decrypted post-capture.\nSituations requiring passive decryption of TLS sessions generally occur in environments where both the client and server, and by inference the data being exchanged over the TLS session, are under the control of the same entity. TLS encryption is often stipulated by internal or external security policies, but access to the unencrypted packet data is required for operational reasons, including:<p>• Application health monitoring and troubleshooting.<p>• Intrusion detection.<p>• Detection of malware activity, e.g. lateral movement, command and control, and data exfiltration traffic.<p>• Detection of advanced Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attacks.<p>• Compliance audits.')
