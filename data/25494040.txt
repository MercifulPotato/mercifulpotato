You wanna see crazy coverage for injection moulding go back to the 1910s when the technique was starting to take off.<p>At the end of the day there just arenâ€™t any big innovations in injection moulding to talk about, it all minor process improvements, may of which are happening behind closed doors, hidden as company secret sauce.<p>3D printing on the other hand. Is such an comparatively underdeveloped and under-utilised technique that just sneezing next to a 3D printer is a form of news worth innovation.')
