I maintain a bot that I think does (1) better.<p>The key is that an issue is only stale if a maintainer has asked a question of the person who filed the issue and that person is not responding. That&#x27;s the only condition.<p>An issue is NOT stale just because there&#x27;s been no activity recently. That could just mean the maintainer is on vacation or has other things to do.  Repos which have bots that close issues for lack of maintainer action are getting off to easy.<p>I’m a bit more torn about locking old issues. On the one hand it saves you from a lot of low-value “me too” spam comments and lets you focus on only open issues. On the other hand you will miss legitimate regressions.')
