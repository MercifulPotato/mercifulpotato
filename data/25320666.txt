Designate some workout breaks with your wife. Immediately before meals is ideal.<p>Then put the luggage on the bed to free up space and otherwise arrange the environment to maximize things. If you get in the way of each other, you can take turns in the bathroom to free space.<p>Then try some HIIT and bodyweight exercises in rapid succession:<p>* Jumping jacks<p>* Jumping squats<p>* Push ups<p>* crabwalk<p>* army crawl<p>* Lifting and carrying each other. Can be an assisted life if you can’t do a full one.<p>* shoulder raises. Some books or other objects can be good here<p>* Bicep curls with any available objects. Even 5 lb is better than nothing<p>* Planks, side planks<p>* Dips on a chair<p>* running in place<p>All of these are simple, none of them risk injury, and all can be done in an extremely tiny space.<p>Depending on reps and exertion you can do them 1-3x a day. Alternate exercises if needed<p>You can also pace back and forth in the tiny strip you create with luggage on the bed. Lack of walking may actually be the <i>hardest</i> part of your space compared to exercise. Doesn’t sound like much fun pacing that small a strip. Like 3-4 steps?<p>Good luck! There’s plenty more bodyweight exercises out there, the ones above are just those I’ve done regularly. You can tire your muscles and get your heart racing in 5-7 min with those.<p>If I misjudged the space, you can do most of those exercises semi effectively on the bed with luggage on the floor. Just don’t push as hard.<p>It should be doable though. I actually do most of those daily in my spare room, around the corner of a bed. Eg for squats I face the corner of the bed. For pushups my legs go along the bed lengthwise, my arms fan out on the other side of the corner.')
