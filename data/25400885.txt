Embrace (financing most of Linux development, with SuSE historically a close 2nd), Extend (introduce Linuxisms such as systemd, containers), Extinguish (make putting together all the F&#x2F;OSS amounting to a complete O&#x2F;S an art, make changes for the sake of it, sell &quot;support&quot;).<p>What&#x27;s not answered is why <i>now</i>, in the middle of an active CentOS release cycle? Smells like IBM&#x2F;RH doesn&#x27;t see growth in new enterprise customers&#x2F;startups coming to Linux (going to clouds&#x2F;k8s instead and focusing on creating Docker images for workloads). RedHat surely must&#x27;ve been fully aware that discontinuing CentOS would create a giant backlash. I guess, like me, few people haven&#x27;t used CentOS as base for new builds anyway; OTOH corporate clouds (OpenShift, k8s) for big customers seems like an attractive market for IBM&#x2F;RH.<p>Edit: a good outcome of this catastrophe might be to shift focus towards POSIX, LSB, and other means for portability which historically had strong following in the Linux and BSD communities')
