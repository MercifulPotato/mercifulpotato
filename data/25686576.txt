This is the deal:\nPoW for eMail needs to come with a parameter that controls the amount of work (computation) done to find the PoW hash. This allows senders to choose on a continuous scale how important it is for them to proof they are not mass mailing spammers.<p>This in turn allows small organizations &#x2F; private mail servers that are not on common anti-spam white lists to proof their good intentions in a decentralized fashion.<p>PoW makes mass mailing very expensive and thus directly hurts spammers that are not on the common anti-spam white lists. Organizations that need to mass mail users for legitimate reasons are most likely already on anti-spam white lists and thus need not to do a very hard PoW hash as they are already proven to not be spamming.')
