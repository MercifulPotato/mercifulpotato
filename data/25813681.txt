This directly questions the unvalidated assertion that, &quot;People don&#x27;t eat a low carb diet by accident, when they do they often follow the horrible advice given by the many misguided keto diet proponents: eat low carb, high fat, medium protein.&quot;<p>Hi-protein is glucogenic and thus not ketogenic, so the ratio would seem to matter. So would the resolution between an avocado and a fistful of bacon, given the safe assumption that the materials and cooking of them rate to have different impacts on human health.<p>This is backed by other meta-analyses such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanpub&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanpub&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2468-2...</a> :<p>&gt; Both high and low percentages of carbohydrate diets were associated with increased mortality, with minimal risk observed at 50â€“55% carbohydrate intake. Low carbohydrate dietary patterns favouring animal-derived protein and fat sources, from sources such as lamb, beef, pork, and chicken, were associated with higher mortality, whereas those that favoured plant-derived protein and fat intake, from sources such as vegetables, nuts, peanut butter, and whole-grain breads, were associated with lower mortality, suggesting that the source of food notably modifies the association between carbohydrate intake and mortality.<p>Stressing that both hi carb (contra your claim) and lo carb <i>when specifically overindexed on animal protein</i> had higher mortality, not just lo carb.')
