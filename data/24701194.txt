It&#x27;s not a service API, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with the back-end. You put a snippet of JS on your page, and then the agency that does your SEO can log in to Google to see a dashboard of site traffic. There&#x27;s no back-end involvement, and back-end developers never need to know that analytics is occurring at all.<p>In terms of what happened to get us here? Analytics became a marketing and BI function. Your choice of front-end analytics is going to be made by your CMO, not your CTO. I mean, your CTO can decide whatever he wants for logging &amp; application analytics, but the CMO is also going to want an analytics suite. For a variety of reasons, this favors hosted front-end-centric JS-based solutions rather than logfiles.<p>The other major thing is that the industry consolidated from 2005-2010. There were like a dozen large vendors, but Omniture bought most of them and then Adobe bought Omniture. By 2015 there are basically two that anyone cares about: Google Analytics, and Adobe Analytics, and GA is free which makes it the default. In both cases, they are part of larger &quot;suites&quot; that package other tools, like campaign targeting and A&#x2F;B testing.<p>The other things are used without a second thought are Firebase (and Firebase Analytics is now merging with Google Analytics), and Facebook tracking pixels.')
