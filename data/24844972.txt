Much of this was because of Amit Singhal, though: he had a strong belief that search should be <i>debuggable</i>, and if there was a query that didn&#x27;t work you should be able to look into the scores and understand why.  There were AI prototypes that actually gave better results than the existing ranking algorithms, but weren&#x27;t placed into production because of concerns on maintainability.  I have no idea if this changed after Amit left.<p>I work on Assistant now, since recently rejoining Google, and it uses AI for the usual suspects: speech and NLP.')
