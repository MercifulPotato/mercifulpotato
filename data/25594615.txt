But another big difference is that Flash was widely pirated and ran on the devices that everyone had (PCs.) A similarly accessable authoring tool would need to run on mobile and be cheaply available. I also think that mobile devices are simply not as good for creative work as PCs (mice&#x2F;keyboards) are. The only way to fit lots of information through a smartphone is to take a video. It cannot be used by amateur programmers nearly as effectively. The special sauce wasn&#x27;t just flash; the special sauce was the PC as a creative platform.')
