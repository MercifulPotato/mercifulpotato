It&#x27;ll be a short list of very loud, vocal, easy targets. I&#x27;d wanna be as far away from that as I could be.<p>Especially since a very large use case for crypto - especially in non-custodial wallets - <i>especially</i> people avoiding KYC, <i>is crime</i>.<p>The ratio of ancaps to criminals on this list is likely very low.<p>[edit] The real risk of finding yourself on this shortlist of non-custodial wallets is suddenly finding yourself on the wrong side of the IRS.<p>Most blockchains are pseudonymous, and the government has tools to track and de-pseudonymize, or at least map and aggregate - transactions. If the government wanted to go after you for breaking this law, they&#x27;d probably just throw together a quick list of people the IRS should start poking around at.<p>They know as well as you do that you probably didn&#x27;t report <i>every</i> transaction you&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> done on <i>every</i> exchange, DEX, or platform. That&#x27;s tax fraud, straight up. Much easier to prove, and much harder to argue on merits.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before, and I&#x27;ll say it again: if your government is coming for you, no amount of magic beans in your computer will keep you or your value safe. If you don&#x27;t trust your government you&#x27;ve got bigger problems than crypto. If you trust your government crypto is irrelevant.<p>As Beria, Stalin&#x27;s side-kick said, &quot;Show me the man and Iâ€™ll find you the crime.&quot;')
