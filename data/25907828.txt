I bought the Gemini PDA a couple of years ago (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.planetcom.co.uk&#x2F;collections&#x2F;gemini-pda&#x2F;products&#x2F;gemini-pda-wifi-only" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.planetcom.co.uk&#x2F;collections&#x2F;gemini-pda&#x2F;product...</a>). If you remember the Psion 5mx, (a contemporary of the later Palms), it had an absolutely amazing keyboard. The designer of that machine was involved, and the Gemini looks like an updated 5mx. The display is touch-sensitive.<p>You can configure the Gemini to run Linux, which I have done. It took a bit of doing, but it works. Once you do that, you have a pocket Linux, with a surprisingly capable keyboard, considering the size. This appears to be far more attractive than these other pocket Linux systems, with their inferior-looking keyboards. So I wouldn&#x27;t trade the Gemini for these alternatives.<p>And I never use it. I bring it with me, but I never use it. It is still far less comfortable than using a laptop. Even on an airplane (economy seat), I prefer the awkwardness of using a laptop, to the compromises required by the Gemini.')
