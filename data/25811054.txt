The easiest solution is to completely ban, deny service and deny affiliation with anyone involved. Much lower risk of the US government blaming them for enabling people to do what they did.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone high up in these companies gives a rat&#x27;s ass about freedom of speech, incitement to violence or hate online, every platform was (and still is) full of that.<p>Up until this incident they maintained the usual &quot;we&#x27;re a neutral platform&quot; spiel, sometimes banning people who were too aggressive, trolling or being reported a lot by others. But now that &quot;shit got real&quot;, they&#x27;re covering their asses.')
