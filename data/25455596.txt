It&#x27;s a really great way to get through them.<p>For fiction, go for something with a professional narrator. Jim Dale&#x27;s Harry Potter series is a good example. They can make it into a modern-day radio drama. But for non-fiction, I prefer if the author reads it. Authors imbibe an excitement to the reading of non-fiction; professionals often come across as monotone and I can&#x27;t focus on them.')
