Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606684649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248063, text='&quot;Just 2D&quot; isn&#x27;t really a thing, given modern GPU usage is all based on fully programmable 3D pipelines anyway. What I mean is the endless frustrating job of debugging closed source game corner cases (and often outright game bugs) is less critical here, since those games won&#x27;t exist for ARM anyway. If it gets to the point where X11 and Wayland, desktop environments, common widget toolkits, browsers, media players, etc work smoothly and stably and perform well, then a lot of people will be very happy already. The long tail will always be there to chip at, and that will take years (not like vendor drivers are bug-free on any OS either!), but it&#x27;s not a blocking factor to a usable desktop Linux experience. Lower-hanging fruit first.')
