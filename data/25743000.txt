Up until early 2000, Canadian tech salaries at least somewhat kept pace with US salaries, albeit 20-30% lower.<p>After the dot com crash, however, for some god-forsaken reason, the surviving tech companies decided that keeping salaries low was the new path to profitability.  Every year the HR departments in Vancouver and Toronto do a hush-hush survey among each other and fix their salaries to the exact same level - maybe 2% but usually closer to 1% higher than the previous year.<p>The result of 20 years of this is that Canadian tech salaries have fallen ridiculously behind those of US companies, resulting in a massive brain drain to the south.<p>Now that Amazon, Microsoft and Google are setting up shop right here in Canada, the talent drain away from Canadian companies is only accelerating.<p>I have no idea what it will take to make companies realize that long term success requires retention of top talent and that that in turn requires paying competitive salaries.')
