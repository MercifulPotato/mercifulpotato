However, if I were (for example) between jobs -- or if my employer refused to pay for travel&#x2F;lodging to conferences -- I&#x27;d still strongly recommend the buy.<p>In my experience, larger or more corporate conferences tend to pay more (including travel, lodging, and sometimes cash compensation), but the smaller, more &quot;community-oriented&quot; conferences do not.')
