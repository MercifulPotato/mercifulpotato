A better way to think about it would be &quot;how much database traffic (and storage) can I serve from Cloud Whatever for $xxx&quot;. Then you need to think about what your realistic effective utilization would be. This server has 153600 GB of raw storage. That kind of storage would cost you $46000 (retail) in Cloud Spanner every month, but I doubt that&#x27;s the right comparison. The right math would probably be that they have 250 million customers and perhaps 1KB of real information per customer. Now the question becomes why you would ever buy 24Ã—6400 GB of flash memory to store this scale of data.')
