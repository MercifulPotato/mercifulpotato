They start investing now and they can have some leverage in the spec.<p>b. The spec is minimal and open to expansion that it sets itself up for more domain specific processors. Which we will be seeing alot more of thanks to the slowing of transistors per dollar growth.<p>c. There is a pretty big theme of moving toward more open and democratized standards in tech.<p>d. They would be the big dogs in RISC-V where as ARM already has big players.<p>e. In both ARM and RISC-V they would be saving the need for extra transistors. My understanding is that there are extra transistors that basically translate x86 machine code to some internal RISC ISA for performance reasons on x86 processors. Due to the slowing of transistors per dollar growth and the maturation of external Fabs Intel and AMD will no longer be able to &#x27;hide&#x27; this deficit.<p>f. No royalties')
