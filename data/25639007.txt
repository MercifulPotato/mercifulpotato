Asia is driving the leading edge of game monetization now, and that leading edge is gacha games (lootbox mechanics&#x2F;disguised digital slot machines).<p>There&#x27;s nothing leading edge about this. Both western and eastern video game companies have been doing this for more than a decade.<p>An infamous example is EA, who have been sucking the fun out of their games with this for ages.
