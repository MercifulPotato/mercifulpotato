Here is a free book sample: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;12P7dqKdsMduqanJ2OW5qjGua3Yy9YCW2&#x2F;view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;12P7dqKdsMduqanJ2OW5qjGua3Yy...</a> .<p>I am looking for feedback on the book. Any feedback is welcome, but I am specifically interested in these questions:\n1. Do you think this book needs a print version? I currently only sell it as an ebook.\n2. Is the price alright for this kind of book? I am especially interested in your opinion if you are not from an OECD country.<p>Will be happy to answer your questions about the book.\nThanks in advance,\nNadia')
