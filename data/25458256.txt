It reads as just a credentialed (and convincing) kook who got someone with authority to listen to him.<p>Maybe that person in authority thought &quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t cost much to try&quot;, or, &quot;we need to keep this guy (Pais) happy so he&#x27;ll finish his other more important tasks&quot; -- then again, maybe they did think in terms of grand disinfo strategy. But nothing outlandish is really required to explain what we can now see.')
