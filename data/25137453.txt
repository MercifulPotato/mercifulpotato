It&#x27;s not very different from where I currently live, but anybody that has enough funds to go on his own does indeed do it. It&#x27;s not, in my opinion, about culture but rather it&#x27;s almost impossible for a 30-year old in these countries to strike it on their own. Pay too low, and living is too expensive. They have to make it work together.')
