I would argue that the most recent actions are not those of completely mentally well folks who are going to respond well to rational discourse. And I don&#x27;t think we should take marching orders from the mental delusions of insurrectionists. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do the right thing because the nutters on &#x27;the other side&#x27; might take it wrong.&quot; Umm, no, I don&#x27;t think so.
