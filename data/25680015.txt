On the one hand I wanted to add nuance to the alarmist headline, on the other (of course) I 100% agree with &quot;let&#x27;s not fuck around with the entire planet with tricky to predict effects like gulf stream etc.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m the kind of person that annoys all the Germans by driving 95km&#x2F;h on highways because it cuts fuel emissions nearly in half compared to the recommended speed of 130km&#x2F;h. We don&#x27;t even pay for fuel, that&#x27;s paid by my SO&#x27;s employer, it&#x27;s purely because it adds like 10% of time on most trips (those 2-3 minutes are negligible) and allows me to visit family without feeling as bad about individual transport (public transport isn&#x27;t really an option here for trips further than the next city over, extremely poor connections even by German standards). Or wear extra clothing and put a blanket over my legs while working and see how low we can put the heater. Or not heat the bedroom at all during fall&#x2F;spring and take a hot water bottle up to get warm under the blanket (must be way more efficient than heating the whole room up). In short, yep I&#x27;m with you on not gambling on these estimates. But I&#x27;m also for nuance and being realistic lest someone claims that &quot;Ã¶kos&quot; &#x2F; climate weirdos hugely exaggerated again and it&#x27;s all not so bad. I find it tricky.')
