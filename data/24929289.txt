Beefing up my servers seems like a worthwhile trade-off.<p>When it comes to latency, or related issues, I find that I&#x27;m still so much better off using LV as a basis and &#x27;dropping down&#x27; into plain JS or (p)react when I need it.<p>We recently delivered a project that involved a whole bunch of stuff that LV was a perfect solution for, but also a core bit of functionality that required various kinds of animations. We ended up using LV wherever we could, and piggy-backed on the LV channel (websockets) to handle synchronizing the animation stuff. The actual code to animate things was just plain old JS. Worked like a charm!')
