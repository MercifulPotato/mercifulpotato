Arkansas lacks in education, research, and a number of other metrics that make it undesirable to develop in. Income taxes are only one part of the tax equation as well, since employers pay a larger chunk of overall taxes in France and other EU countries [1] compared to the US. Again, an employer (or startup) being forced to pay very high taxes on worker income gives a lot of incentive to reduce worker income and makes it more difficult for cash strapped startups to find personnel. Factoring in the employer side makes the tax difference more in the range of 10-20%, not 3%. That difference gets passed on to the worker, either in cash for large companies or in stock options for startups, since the software job market is highly competitive.<p>Healthcare costs for FAANG and other big tech employees (such as those that would be making $500k) are on the order of $2000&#x2F;year or less. The company I currently work for covers all health insurance costs for me and I can choose to enroll dependents at a small cost per month. Again, adding high healthcare costs here for an engineer making $500k is unrealistic.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crfb.org&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;us-highest-taxed-nation-world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crfb.org&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;us-highest-taxed-nation-world</a>')
