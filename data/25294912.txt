If you want wake-up on completion, you create a thread&#x2F;green thread&#x2F;task&#x2F;coroutine (whatever fits your bill) and have it <i>await</i> the future (likely also make the call that creates it)<p>What do you get by doing that inside the future machinery? Maybe fewer tasks and their call stacks, but is that a huge problem?<p>Also, what’s with <i>wake</i> and <i>poll</i>? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;std&#x2F;future&#x2F;trait.Future.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;std&#x2F;future&#x2F;trait.Future.html</a>:<p><i>“Futures alone are inert; they must be actively polled to make progress, meaning that each time the current task is woken up, it should actively re-poll pending futures that it still has an interest in.<p>The poll function is not called repeatedly in a tight loop -- instead, it should only be called when the future indicates that it is ready to make progress (by calling wake())”</i><p>So, an asynchronous task that doesn’t have an answer yet calls <i>wake</i> to tell some object that it has to call <i>poll</i> on the task, so that the asynchronous task can make more progress? Why doesn’t it just do what it was asked to do until it has an answer?<p>Also, if a future is inert, how can it ever detect that it is ready to make progress and call <i>wake</i>?<p>I really do not understand this design.<p>I guess a UML sequence diagram (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.mwikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sequence_diagram" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.mwikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sequence_diagram</a>) would help me. It would show what entities exist (if Rust’s future is inert, it can’t be much more than the memory block holding the function result and a reference to the async code. If so, what’s doing the computation?) put names on them, and show what calls they make.')
