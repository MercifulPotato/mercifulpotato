Item(by='lolinder', descendants=None, kids=[25197839], score=None, time=1606187613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194723, text='I tried it out about a month ago, and my sense was it&#x27;s definitely on the right track, but I wouldn&#x27;t by any means put it into production yet. The UI was surprisingly useful rather than gimmicky, and the use of types was very cool. I was particularly impressed with the migrations framework, which was really easy to work with.<p>I didn&#x27;t get too far into it, though, because at the time it didn&#x27;t support the Haskell language server, which made exploring the framework hard. They&#x27;ve added support for that since then, so I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it again. I&#x27;d also love to hear people&#x27;s experiences, if anyone has gotten further in it.')
