Later, she said only a sea sponge would believe her.<p>Presumably, she is arguing that hyperbolic proclamations are a valid way to get people to listen and engage in political discourse.<p>Of course, I presume that by &quot;serious people&quot; you are referring to scientists, but it definitely creates a mixed message from politicians- you know, the ones setting government policy.<p>At what point is it not hyperbole, but actual serious discussion? Should we treat <i>everything</i> as hyperbolic? All this does is confuse the problem (making it more or less drastic than it actually is).<p>In my lifetime, &quot;serious people&quot; have often made predictions about drastic things and were completely wrong- and they had models to support them! This is true about many things beyond climate change as well. Why should this be any different? Why should I believe that I should act, or believe that there is still time to do so? Is this a new hockey stick graph?<p>If you don&#x27;t invest a lot of time sorting through all the BS, most people I think end up flipping a coin, picking a side and just going with it.')
