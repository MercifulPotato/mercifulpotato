Item(by='paulmd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604475208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24986521, text='&gt; My only gripe with it is that it only supports 2.4GHz WiFi<p>I noted the same thing and eh.  While this means your router has to continue to support a 2.4 GHz AP, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an unusual decision as far as the &quot;internet of things&quot;, due to cost reasons (as opposed to migrating every IOT to 5 GHz).  I think you will have to maintain all three now.<p>Devices are eventually going to segregate themselves onto their own networks: 2.4 GHz for legacy &#x2F; low-cost &#x2F; IOT, 5 GHz for data rate, wigig&#x2F;wifi 6&#x2F;etc for extreme data rate.  The performance hit on your other bands should be minimal even considering contetion.<p>There&#x27;s no sense updating the wireless module for faster wifi and probably not any sense updating past 100 mbit wired ethernet either.<p>&gt; I recently bought a dirt cheap Brother B+W printer to replace a Canon inktjet printer and am very happy with the decision.<p>Do note that canon inkjet printers can often be easily retrofitted for bulk &quot;continuous tank&quot; ink, which can actually make them surprisingly affordable to run as far as inkjets go!  The ink itself isn&#x27;t really that expensive, just packaging (it&#x27;s a &quot;priced according to demand&quot; product).  I&#x27;d look at bulk ink &quot;cost per page&quot; for photo before you toss it.<p>I think it&#x27;ll probably still work out to being economically cheaper per page to get a brother B+W or color laser but if you can argue the bulk ink inkjet with printing some photos or school projects at home then maybe.  Laser (color or B+W) is cheaper for b+w and occasional color presentation, and sending out to costco&#x2F;kinkos&#x2F;whatever is better for photos or premium presentation.<p>(There still is no comparison to professional photo printers of course - check out White House Custom Color, despite the &quot;we&#x27;re a pro service house! what is your <i>professional account number</i>&quot; facade they&#x27;re open to you even if you just want a couple family photos printed nice, and they have equipment and expertise you don&#x27;t. Work out your cost per page and if you fuck up once on a big print you probably lose vs just sending it out, I bet.)')
