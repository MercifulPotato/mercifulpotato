It is only simpler if you completely ignore the downsides of microservices. Taking a &quot;monolith&quot; application and turning it into a distributed application rarely makes it simpler. Now you have to deal with network failures, serialising and deserialising data for what was previously just a method call, API versioning all over the place, kubernetes&#x2F;terraform&#x2F;etc configs from hell, concurrency and race conditions still persist but now they&#x27;re spread across services instead of between threads. You want data consistency and transactions? Forget about it!')
