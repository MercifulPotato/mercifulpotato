You can definitely create a shockingly good lab for ~3000 though.<p>Agreed. Biohacking budgets seldom ever go beyond 10k in my experience, I&#x27;ve spent more than that by the time I was 18 on my car and parts. That&#x27;s not to say that isn&#x27;t a lot of money, and mostly discretionary, but its entirely do-able.<p>So much stuff can be bought second hand now, or you can do what some Biohackers did and go dumpster diving at University campuses for broken or old lab equipment--Josiah did that to start the ODIN before going to NASA.<p>This requires you either to be in school and know the days they do it, usually after the finals in the Spring on my campus, or pay someone to find out. Either way, its doable: I picked up a microscope and a few cracked magnetic stirring hotplates and a random box of misc glassware and metal stands my Junior year when I swore I was going to turn my living room into a wet-lab once I made enough to buy an old BD flow cytometer after graduation.<p>Those plans were soon dashed when I realized I could just go to the lab of the The Scripps Research Institute after I did my training there my senior year. I think I just ended up giving it all away on Craigslists as a starter &#x27;Lab kit&#x27; years later and it was gone pretty fast.')
