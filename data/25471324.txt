Focus all energy on delivering a knock-out blow to Intel (in x86&#x2F;64) or try to do other stuff too?<p>For the next several years at least, there is still a whole lot of money to be made selling x86&#x2F;64 chips. (I don&#x27;t know if Microsoft has plans to move mainstream Windows users off x86&#x2F;64, but even if they do, it won&#x27;t happen quickly.)<p>Right now, AMD has an opportunity to take x86&#x2F;64 away from Intel. Probably the best opportunity in decades. There&#x27;s something to be said for focusing all resources on delivering a knock-out blow right now, before the opportunity is gone.<p>On the other hand, ARM might have a better future over the long term. And it isn&#x27;t necessarily true that AMD would be spreading itself too thin by trying to do both.')
