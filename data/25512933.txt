Basically all Earth materials are crystalline.  So rocks are alive (colonial organisms I guess since they are aggregates of crystalline minerals) but the magma that they crystallize from is not alive?  Or is magma alive too?  What about obsidian, which is glass but compositionally identical to a crystalline igneous rock. No crystals!  The Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle: Crystalline.  Alive.  The Earth&#x27;s outer core: liquid iron and nickel.  Non-living.  The inner core: crystalline iron and nickel. Alive.<p>Crystallization is reversible in a thermodynamic sense.  You take some granite, melt it, and then cool it (slowly, under pressure), and you have granite again.  Is this a phoenix&#x2F;Jesus-like life and death cycle?  Or does life only change forms?<p>I agree with you generally that &#x27;life&#x27; may be gradational. However I think calling crystals &#x27;life&#x27; actually removes any meaning whatsoever from the term. If the line isn&#x27;t somewhere in the neighborhood of viruses and prions then it kinda has to expand to include anything made of matter (and then energy etc.).<p>While we don&#x27;t (and don&#x27;t have to) have a precise definition of &#x27;life&#x27;, the &#x27;life&#x27; gradation needs to branch like a Bezier curve off the x axis at some point for it to be a functional term.')
