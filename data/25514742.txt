Provide recompense to society for the production of a negative externality.<p>2. Create a disincentive against the production of a negative externality.<p>If fines could be levied perfectly, automatically and without administration cost, then perhaps you can see the fine as #1, and set the fine at the societal cost.<p>But, because it costs money to enforce regulations, there&#x27;s usually some sampling done: if you park illegally, you might not be caught. Because the chance of getting caught is not 100%, and because those who are not caught do not contribute their share of enforcement costs, the fines for a single infraction must be a multiple of the actual harm caused. (Assuming that can even be measured.)<p>Let&#x27;s say the harm caused is $20 per infraction, and this is normally enough to disincentive a poor person from parking illegally. If they make a mistake and are subsequently caught, is it better for them to pay $100 (for the harm caused, plus paying for those who weren&#x27;t caught), even though this may be equivalent to their family&#x27;s monthly food budget?<p>As long as $20 fine is enough to:<p>- provide a strong disincentive, and<p>- provide recompense<p>... then that should be enough, no?<p>The rich person, for whom a $20 fine is not enough of a disincentive, should pay more ($200?). And the money raised can be used to cover negative externalities for those who weren&#x27;t caught, and overall enforcement costs.')
