I&#x27;ve been using C++ as my main language since the early 90s and it pains me to see what it has become. I thought that I might&#x27;ve been missing something all along. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t.<p>The talk all but confirmed my lingering assumption that C++ is <i>intentionally</i> designed to be an over-engineered language with no particular regard to the elegance of its construction. Worse yet, Bjarne did it all of his own free will rather than being forced into that by &quot;the committee&quot; (which would&#x27;ve been a weak, but acceptable excuse).<p>If C++ were created just today, out of thin air and in its current form, there is no way in hell it would&#x27;ve seen <i>any</i> adoption. C++ is basically a long running bait-n-switch scheme. Come try a better C and then see it evolve into the Homer&#x27;s car, which you have no choice but to use because it&#x27;s now - surprise - an industry standard.<p>So, yeah, there you go &#x2F;rant.')
