Item(by='geophile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608598254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501600, text='&gt; The quality of service I received is one of the best I have ever received. When I called to find out more about the New Model M not only was the help I received exemplarity, but once I placed my order, even though it had the custom configuration of macOS support added was shipped within 24 hours of placing the order and the item received is fantastic in every possible way.<p>That&#x27;s sales support. Technical support is not so great. I bought a Model M from Unicomp about two years ago. Within about a year, one key became flaky, not registering sometimes. This increased to maybe 10-20% misses. I contacted support and the only help they could provide was to ship the keyboard back at MY expense. For THEIR defective product. That seemed pretty outrageous given that the shipping cost is a significant fraction of the purchase price.<p>A decent company would send me a replacement immediately, requiring me to return the faulty item, paying shipping both ways. As much as I like their keyboards, I cannot recommend buying from Unicomp because of their poor support.')
