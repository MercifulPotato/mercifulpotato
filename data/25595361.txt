Visa and Mastercard&#x27;s duopoly power to coerce virtually any business, even one as large as Pornhub, is problematic. They are a single point of failure, and since electronic payment processing is a fundamental utility service that underlies virtually all activity, this duopoly results in very real censorship. Censorship masquerading as safety is not a new concept, but it has come to become more normalized on the Internet in recent years, with deplatforming becoming a popular tactic for activists. Now the anti-porn religious lobby is now pressuring credit card companies to block ALL payments to ALL porn sites (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-52543508" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-52543508</a>).<p>2. Pornhub has received a lot of critique over their practices of allowing unverified accounts to upload videos and so on. However the volume of abusive content found on Pornhub is far less than other sites like Facebook. Furthermore, any platform is going to have some level of illegal content. Requiring <i>zero</i> illegal content seems unrealistic and is a level of perfection society doesn&#x27;t expect of any other large-scale service.<p>3. The recent NY Times article that resulted in the Pornhub payment blockade is resulting in the rise of a new puritanism. Pornhub and other prominent porn sites have made changes to censor various kinks. Many search keywords on these sites now return no results. Many categories of videos are being deleted altogether. And some sites like Xvideos have started to shorten video titles by shrinking words they deem to be problematic to single letters (for example &quot;son&quot; becomes &quot;s&quot;).<p>4. No regard has been given to those who rely on this ecosystem as a means of living, especially when it is an income stream people are particularly reliant on during the pandemic. The sudden blockade of payments and policy changes at porn sites made with no warning, leaves them with unexpected income insecurity.')
