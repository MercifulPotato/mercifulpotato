What kind of first class spy agency would miss a target, let alone 2 (Skripal and Navalny)?<p>Murdering someone is not a hard feat especially when you are a government agency with all the resources necessary to do so.<p>In the case of Navalny, it was even easier as they were &quot;playing&quot; at home.<p>What&#x27;s the point of re-using a super duper chemical nerve agent that already demonstrated that it was not a sure deal?<p>Now it&#x27;s possible the Russians lost all the KGB experience (remember the Bulgarian umbrella?) and are subpar spies. Why do we need to be afraid of them then?<p>I believe that when a spy story ends up in the press, it&#x27;s because we are the targets for propaganda. Else it stays in the shadows.<p>My theory (which is just that, a theory) is that the US is trying hard to block the Russian gas pipeline to Europe, and this kind of stories allow them to impose sanctions.')
