Because the RIAA letter provided no location of an infringing copy to be taken down, I can argue the letter cannot be a section 512 notice.  Further, the content taken down by Github in response to this letter was not an infringing copy.<p>It is not clear that the unit tests, if performed, amounted to anything more than fair use.  Under the DMCA, it is not necessarily infringement for the script author to circumvent copy controls; section 1201 prohibits sharing copy control circumvention technology with others but does not prohbit the act of copy control circumvention.<p>If one wanted to make the argument that DMCA 512 safe harbor applies to a section 1201 notice, then I am surprised there has been no mention of &quot;material that is the subject of infringing activity&quot;.  This language is found in section 512 and in many standard DMCA notice instructions, e.g., Microsoft&#x27;s<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;MSDMCA.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;MSDMCA.html</a><p>The youtube-dl script itself is not infringing material. However is it &quot;material that is the subject of infringing activity&quot;.  If the script only works to circumvent copy controls not access controls, then those unit tests, i.e., the making of unauthorised copies, that may have been performed by the developers, i.e., suspected &quot;infringing activity&quot;, are subject to a defense of fair use.  If it is fair use then it is not infringing activity and the script cannot be &quot;material that is the subject of infringing activity&quot;.')
