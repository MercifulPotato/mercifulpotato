That means that I&#x27;m already in regular communication with them and an active member of the conversation.<p>Casually bring up some shortcomings about the current messenger and see if others agree.<p>Then don&#x27;t jump the gun on new messengers. If it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;, it&#x27;s usually not ready to invite others. When it is &quot;awesome&quot; is when it&#x27;s the right time.
