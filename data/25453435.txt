Here&#x27;s a photo of the PCB after it was put together!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.postimg.cc&#x2F;PqdsVszZ&#x2F;IMG-20201105-172236.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.postimg.cc&#x2F;PqdsVszZ&#x2F;IMG-20201105-172236.jpg</a><p>The top circuitry and chip are the Bluetooth circuitry. The PCB antenna is hidden away under the top CYGNUS solder mask. It&#x27;s got three servo channels, two high current pyro channels that can be variables controlled to deliver a variable current using PWM, it&#x27;s using a BMI088 as the IMU , a MS something or other chip (can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head) as the altimeter. It&#x27;s got 16Mb of flash which is that chip to the top left next to the microcontroller. It&#x27;s got an SD card port for data storage, buzzer, neopixel LED and a buck converter for converting the LiPo 11V to 5V efficiently as well as a linear regulator for converting from 5V to 3.3V. lemme know if you&#x27;ve got any questions!')
