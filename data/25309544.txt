It also has &quot;script&quot; in the name.<p>I think &quot;scripting&quot; vs &quot;programming&quot; language differentiation is elitist nonsense. This isn&#x27;t a meaningful boundary. It&#x27;s more useful to speak of languages in terms of strong&#x2F;duck&#x2F;loose typing, syntax, supported programming paradigms, ecosystems, available libraries and tooling, and intended use cases.')
