Reddit made the national news last year because moderators of r&#x2F;The_Donald failed to police the numerous posts of users who plotted to murder the governor of Michigan.<p>Parler, by contrast, did not moderate calls to violence. It quickly became a safe space for neo-fascists to plan, coordinate, and execute plots against the US government.<p>Parler was playing a completely different game to Twitter, Reddit, and FB. Parler was deservedly ejected from the stadium.')
