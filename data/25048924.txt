Because while two people may have the same injury, one of them may be able to completely ignore the pain even\nwithout medication - so giving medication would only do harm - while the second person may need medication in order to function.<p>Assuming such a scale was used, it would make sense for the nurse to say &quot;it isn&#x27;t an 8&quot; - because if it was an eight you wouldn&#x27;t have been able to listen calmly and explain that to her, by definition.')
