We don&#x27;t have good treatments for most illnesses. We don&#x27;t even really know which illnesses are which (take a look at how the DSM changes over relatively short time periods).<p>This is the real reason people are hesitant to admit having or discuss others illnesses.<p>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m one of those people. I have what has been variously called Severe Depression, Treatment Resistant Depression, Major Mood Disorder and is now called Major Depressive Disorder. My symptoms haven&#x27;t changed and its only been a decade. So you can see how ephemeral diseases are in this field. Until we can reliably classify diseases, we can&#x27;t even look for causes. Until we have causes, treatments are no better than herbal medicine.')
