The article itself points to several ways in which the committee in question didn&#x27;t follow their own guidelines.  It also points to &quot;Code of Conduct Best Practices&quot; which aren&#x27;t followed by the Code of Conduct in question.<p>&gt; Any set of strict&#x2F;influential laws should be supported by a proper set of institutions like courts, lawyers, arbitration, judging practice.<p>This is I think a big problem right now.  Our community adopted a Code of Conduct proactively; we haven&#x27;t yet had to deal with any issues.  But I&#x27;m painfully aware that doing this sort of policing well takes time, skill, and training, which I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable for normal community members to take.<p>On the one hand, I&#x27;d love to be able to (for instance) outsource all CoC engagement and enforcement to a specialized body, that could manage a whole investigation &#x2F; accuser &#x2F; defense &#x2F; jury system for a number of different organizations.<p>On the other hand, there are an awful lot of decisions made that I very much disagree with.
