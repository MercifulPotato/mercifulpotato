I have a standard portfolio of index funds split between stocks, bonds, real estate and cash, weighted more into bonds.  The bonds and cash weight is because I think the market will tank at some point, the stocks are because I might be wrong.<p>2. I rebalance periodically to take profit from whatever is doing best.<p>3. I&#x27;ve tried to broaden my investments further by adding a &quot;market neutral&quot; fund from Vanguard, and an asset fund.<p>That&#x27;s the basic setup.  As I said, I&#x27;m pessimistic about the stock market, but not out of it, so I&#x27;ve based my allocations on that. I&#x27;m not too worried about index funds being a bubble themselves.  If the market goes down enough to trash index funds as a class, there won&#x27;t be anywhere to hide... That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying the market neutral fund.  I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t correlate with the stock or bond market.  That&#x27;s my big concern, that everything will crash at once.<p>I am somewhat concerned about the Fed&#x27;s actions, so I have added an asset fund in case we end up with more inflation than people expect.<p>Personally, I think we will have a crash, but I&#x27;ve been wrong so far.  I just don&#x27;t see how the market will go up rapidly for another 5 years, and if it doesn&#x27;t, that doesn&#x27;t justify the current prices, but who knows...')
