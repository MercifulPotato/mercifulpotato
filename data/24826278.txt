Item(by='hirundo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603115049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825887, text='&gt; What is often overlooked about Jordan Peterson’s views on the subject is that he is totally on board with using inclusive language in a private context. He just doesn’t want it to be legally enforced. This is an important distinction.<p>I much appreciate the author emphasizing this point, because I think it&#x27;s crucial and often missed. It&#x27;s perfectly fine for people to use language that they feel is more inclusive, but not so fine when they try to enforce the boundaries, particularly at the point of a gun, which all laws imply.<p>But I think that distinction should extend to non-legal &quot;policing&quot;. If I say &quot;guys&quot; or &quot;mankind&quot; in a sense that is meant to be inclusive, but someone else interprets that as not inclusive, I don&#x27;t feel responsible for their interpretation, any more than I would feel responsible for someone&#x27;s misinterpretation of &quot;niggardly&quot;. They can choose to be offended, but if that clearly was not my intent, I don&#x27;t feel the need to accommodate them. I&#x27;ve found that some people have a desire, even a mission to feel offended, and don&#x27;t feel that it helps either of us to tiptoe around their neurosis. Because of the seemingly infinite flexibility of their offense taking, I couldn&#x27;t fail to offend no matter how much I tried, and I&#x27;ve learned that by trying and trying and trying.<p>If I say a phrase that has long meant &quot;all of you&quot;, but you have now decided means &quot;all of you males&quot;, then I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m responsible for your offense taking. I think you&#x27;re responsible for purposely redefining the clear meaning to score some kind of points.')
