I totally agree on all of the points. I&#x27;ve already considered the global play&#x2F;volume controls with a main output patch point and will redo the slider to look more as an actual slider. The presets and tutorials&#x2F;documentation is something that just needs a lot of time, which is really limited for a side project :)<p>Patchcab started as an exercise for myself to learn the basics of modular audio and music theory. Working with tools I already know seemed the best idea and the  Tone.js was a prefect fit for this. The exercise then turned to an idea of a modular (code and audio wise) Javascript&#x2F;Typescript synth that would resemble VCV visually. Porting VCV itself to a browser is a really interesting idea and has been done to some extent <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;miRackModular&#x2F;Rack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;miRackModular&#x2F;Rack</a>, but is really out of scope for what I wanted to build :) \nThat said, I feel like porting some open source Eurorack modules (Mutable instruments, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pichenettes&#x2F;eurorack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pichenettes&#x2F;eurorack</a>, I&#x27;m looking at you) would be a really nice next step.')
