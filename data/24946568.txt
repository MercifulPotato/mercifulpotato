I don&#x27;t see any issues.<p>This sort of collusion is pretty common too. See local COVID19 response state consortia, codes like UCC, professional accreditations, etc. Without that, the US government would be impotent, since there are things which are outside of federal power,  but which require coordination across states. If this were banned, the US would collapse.')
