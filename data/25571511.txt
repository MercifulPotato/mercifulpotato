I think it&#x27;s hard to conceptualize the bubbles that people live in until you experience it directly. People in various demographics have, quite literally, &quot;no idea how the other half lives&quot;.<p>However, I still think inequality is a massive problem. People in trades or services that work for larger conglomerate companies can&#x27;t fly under the radar, don&#x27;t have health benefits, and can be laid off en masse. They aren&#x27;t generally &quot;doing OK&quot;.<p>Also:<p>&gt;every kind of engineering other than &quot;software engineering&quot; requires occupational licensing and has professional associations that both stick up for workers and set a bar for training and quality<p>Once upon a time, that was the reality. These days a lot of occupational licensing exists solely for profiteering and protectionism. Professional education&#x2F;certification companies print money on the back of egregious CPE requirements, while new entrants to the field find themselves absolutely crowded out of a few entry level jobs with financially prohibitive certification and education requirements. Mind you, these grads already have a pile of debt, and no way to pay it back yet. Those groups work great if you&#x27;ve been in the field for 15+ years, not so much if you&#x27;re just starting out.<p>For better or worse, software engineering is slightly more egalitarian in that regard: you can self-educate, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to amass a ton of debt, and can get even an entry-level job that would make the Simpson&#x27;s life &quot;attainable&quot;.')
