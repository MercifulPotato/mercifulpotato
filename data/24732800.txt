In relation to public demonstrations this may mean a group of people showing up with helmet, shield, or legal &#x27;weapons&#x27; (e.g. slingshot and steel beads, or what not).<p>Likewise for the ban on face coverings, it is primarily to deal with people showing up with bike helmets, gas masks, etc. in order to (a) protect themselves against tear gas, and (b) not be identified (usually while they commit violence against police and property).<p>&gt; &quot;<i>â€œIt is ironic that a country with such a long and proud tradition of collective action for social change is criminalizing protest in this way</i>&quot;<p>On the contrary, it&#x27;s because France has a long tradition of &#x27;collective action&#x27; (i.e. really riots and revolutions) that a body of laws to counter violence has come about.<p>&gt; <i>The French authorities must stop criminalizing people and amend all the laws that hamper the right to peaceful assembly.</i><p>The offences mentioned above are not related to peaceful assembly.<p>Amnesty International is being rather disingenuous in this article.')
