Incentives remain aligned, even if they get paid before the student does.<p>.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s a nice idea to align the incentives of the school and student, but the current implementation doesn&#x27;t do that if the school sells&#x2F;finances ISAs<p>But the current implementation _does_ do that.<p>Debt is always &quot;scored&quot; before being sold off - which factors in to how much the debt ends up being sold for.<p>In this case, the scoring depends on how much gets paid back per ISA, which is subsequently determined by the placement success. Here&#x27;s a couple of ways this _could_ happen:<p><pre><code>  • If the overall placement % goes up - so more debt (ISA&#x27;s) is actually paid vs not paid (b&#x2F;c conditions aren&#x27;t met)\n  • If the avg. salary per placement increases - so more $ is actually paid per ISA (with respect to the $30k cap)\n</code></pre>\nIf Lambda can show success in placement, meaning more return is made on each ISA, then the ISA&#x27;s will be &quot;scored&quot; higher.<p>As to whether or not they are sold upfront - thats a nonfactor to me. If Lambda doesn&#x27;t do its job training and placing people, they don&#x27;t make money. Either way this still holds true.<p>Also, all the financing could be happening and student STILL will &quot;not pay any upfront tuition&quot; and &quot;won&#x27;t pay until they are earning $50k&quot; or more a year - as Lambda advertises.')
