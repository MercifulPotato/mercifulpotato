It&#x27;s meaningless, the CEO doesn&#x27;t have a say anymore. Salesforce&#x27;s designs are the relevant direction now, and they&#x27;re not telling. Facebook (Telegram, Oculus, Instagram) and IBM (dozens of companies) come to mind as specific examples of acquisitions in which the former CEO insisted that business would continue as usual, only for the management teams to be gutted and the company culture eradicated.')
