In fact, they are much more interesting and valuable to us if they don&#x27;t.  Differences in values, territory, what they need to be happy, all of that can be worked out through negotiation and communication - or not, and we can just give them space and avoid our own interference as much as possible, while providing the resources they need.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to emphasize that you&#x27;re right - bringing a new species into the world as it currently stands with massive inequality and many human problems left completely unsolved isn&#x27;t a good idea.  Doing so after a post scarcity society has formed and there are enough resources to go around (not all that far off...) - much more reasonable.  Expecting a new species to just magically integrate with society and &quot;get jobs&quot; is a little silly here.  I think we need to differentiate the moral problem of eventually increasing another species&#x27; intelligence capabilities in the future under our best efforts at responsible conditions - vs doing so right now in this shitstorm.')
