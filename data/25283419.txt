Especially the major PHP frameworks and libraries tend to be too complicated and Java-esque for my liking. There are some nice simpler alternatives, but they tend to get abandoned in favour of the larger projects.<p>But when looking at PHP in terms of deployment and making traditional SQL-based websites&#x2F;API&#x27;s it&#x27;s unmatched. Just reading up on deploying Python code using uWSGI, or connecting to a SQL database gives me headaches, and the confusing package management and versioning system makes things even worse. Running Node feels unpredictable, with the server crashing because you forgot to catch an exception somewhere or having some weird state.<p>With PHP it&#x27;s just: write the code, copy the files to a server and stuff (usually) just works. That&#x27;s why i keep using it. Not that pretty, but it always gets the job done.')
