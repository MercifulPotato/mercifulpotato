If you&#x27;re not based in the UK or EU, say you&#x27;re in the US... well good luck.  Swiss cheese has fewer holes than US privacy laws!<p>Having said all that, as a user of Notion I&#x27;ve been incredibly impressed.  Their support staff seem friendly and responsive and they keep making the product better and better.<p>My only gripes are the weird password email confirmation of the mobile app login, and that I can&#x27;t use it as a Zettelkasten.<p>Other than that, it really is fantastic.  The Kanban and other features meant that it&#x27;s replaced other apps I was using for both work and personal.  It really is worth a try.')
