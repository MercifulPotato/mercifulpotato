The best Brazilian hospital (Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo) charges 1.7k USD for a C section (my son was born recently there), while the lowest I&#x27;ve found in that site is 2.6K USD (don&#x27;t know about the quality) and median seems to be 8K USD. I bet the other procedures have similar price differences.<p>You can pay for the trip, get the best care (it is a really good, international level, hospital) and still have some loney left.')
