Public housing for white people in the 1930s was great, then with the red scare, the government decided that subsidizing home ownership would prevent the spread of socialism in the US. It was quite effective, but access to cheap home loans and cheap new developments was racially segregated: only new developments that would be largely white would get the FHA-subsidizided home loans. This is the well-documented &quot;red lining.&quot;<p>This led to the economic segregation where the housing projects were only for Black people, were in areas without access to good schools or jobs. It&#x27;s no wonder the housing projects failed, because they were largely doomed to failure.')
