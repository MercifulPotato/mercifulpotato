It&#x27;s good to acknowledge that learning with others is often more rewarding then learning on your own, but even more important it so recognize that learning is not a means to an end but an end in itself. And as such, speaking of &quot;specialised&quot; or &quot;foundational&quot; knowledge, or putting quantities on knowledge really doesn&#x27;t do it justice.')
