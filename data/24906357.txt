A lot of institutional investors are long-only. That is their mandate. All the information they may have does not change that fact.<p>It is <i>unlikely</i> that you will beat the market in the long run and if you do, it may well be down to chance, but it is possible, because the market is <i>not</i> perfect.<p>Furthermore, you can not &quot;buy the market&quot; in the first place. You can buy ETFs replicating stock indices, but that is not the same. If you bought the S&amp;P you will have performed differently than if you had bought MSCI world. Ultimately, stock picking is just a less diversified version of buying an index.')
