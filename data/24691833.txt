There&#x27;s something about tangible things anchoring the mind. Like the most recent example we forayed into is looking to purchase a physical kitchen timer just to find and crank the thing and get a reminder going. The barrier there is so low that I think we&#x27;d actually get in the habit of timing things more readily. Compared to setting a timer in the phone there&#x27;s just too many small obstacles and interference that can get in the way that in aggregate the activation energy just becomes too much and the timing operation never gets done.<p>There&#x27;s something to say about a physical thing demanding less mental mobilization in some scenarios where going tangible makes better sense from an experience the world and get things done perspective.')
