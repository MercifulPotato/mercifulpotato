Of course going to a top school makes the application process easier, but only insofar that you clear the resume screen and get some confirmation&#x2F;credential bias in your favor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s great that tech companies can have Stanford alongside community college. But honestly it seems a bit of a waste when my classmates who went to Stanford and Harvard end up at Facebook or Google. Truly the best minds of my generation devoted to getting people to click on ads.')
