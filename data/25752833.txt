So this is the challenge they had if they wanted to move to physical infra after being given notice - 500 servers in 24 hours.<p>(As a side note, setting up physical infra at the scale of growth Parler was having wouldn&#x27;t have been practically possible - they had a giant and rapid spike across the last month or so. It also wouldn&#x27;t have been financially wise, considering they probably don&#x27;t have the capital and the traffic spike was probably a temporary surge. Plus if you buy physical infra and then your apps get removed by the other cloud providers, that changes your traffic profile again... Parler really had both their hands tied behind their backs to fight this thing).')
