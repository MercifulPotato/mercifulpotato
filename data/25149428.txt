Programmers certainly don&#x27;t, they have to report times and timezones in their software as the populace expects it to be reported. Governments can change timezones, but they&#x27;re not going to, because the political cost of telling everyone that they&#x27;re in a new timezone is greater than the political cost of telling programmers where to shove it.<p>Most of the public will see absolutely no reason why they should have to permanently change the timezone they&#x27;re in for the sake of a one-time event. And honestly, even as a programmer who&#x27;d be doing the fixing, I agree that they&#x27;re right.')
