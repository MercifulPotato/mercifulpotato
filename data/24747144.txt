It&#x27;s very rare to find someone who has founded more than one billion dollar plus company.<p>There are some good reasons for this:<p>- If you created such a company, you may still be running it. Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerburg, Larry Ellison. By the time you retire from that you&#x27;re super wealthy and old, there&#x27;s little reason to start over.<p>- Founding a company is HARD. Few people who went through that once are interested in doing it again. Paul Graham wrote about how he feels that way, although he did do it again with YC.<p>But I think the point is fair that success at that level requires not just skill but a lot of luck of being in the right place at the right time with the right idea and the right combination of skill and connections to pull it off. It&#x27;s extremely unlikely.<p>You can certainly say Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerburg are skilled and they work hard. But it&#x27;s clear they were also very lucky.')
