Back then there were a ton of distributions. Most of those that were descendant from RedHat came with their own set of tools and yum was only one of many (like zypp and apt-rpm). And of course the reason there were so many is that the developer of rpm, RedHat, had nothing on offer. Debian had apt so their descendent distributions didn’t develop alternatives.<p>RedHat Enterprise&#x2F;Fedora adopted yum around 2003, as far as I can tell and RedHat the original free distribution never did. Certainly not in 1999.')
