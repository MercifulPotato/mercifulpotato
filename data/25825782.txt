It could be cause A or the more rare but serious cause B. It takes imaging to determine whether it&#x27;s A or B. Elsewhere in the world, they just assume it&#x27;s A as the patient is &quot;old&quot; because it&#x27;s financially impractical to test for B. My wife on the other had has no constraints from ordering the imaging test even though 9&#x2F;10 times it&#x27;s not needed. But the other 10% of the time, it saves the life.<p>This just plain isn&#x27;t true in general. I grew up in the US with probably the best insurance of anyone I&#x27;ve ever known. I&#x27;ve also lived in Sweden with the state-run insurance (without any private addition). I&#x27;ve had great care in the US. I&#x27;ve had great care in Sweden. In fact, my care in Sweden has honestly probably been better in my cases including where I had overuse injury to my knee due to sports where they really could just say &quot;well quit running so much and let your body rest and leave the healthcare system to those not actively inducing their own injury&quot;, but they did not. Fast MRIs, fast diagnosis, fast help, fast everything. I understand this is entirely anecdotal, but the fact is there are many much cheaper systems out there run by governments that actually function _better_ than the US system even for those in the US with good insurance.')
