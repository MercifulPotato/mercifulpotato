Rather than travelling to the client for a 1 or 2 hour meeting where I need to sign in and wait. I can stay in the office and dial in right as the meeting is about to commence.<p>Secondly I generally have a workpaper of some sort or a set of notes I am working off of during a meeting. During a virtual meeting I can talk, look at my notes and type without having to constantly give eye contact to the client. I can acknowledge what they&#x27;re saying through non-verbal cues as I look at my notes and type.<p>Thirdly, it&#x27;s much easier for myself or the client to share our screens during a conversation.<p>Edit: Due to COVID our ability to work remotely from other cities is also expanding. It is much easier for me to rely on Google meet or Teams to dial a colleague in, rather than hope that the client has a working AV system to dial them in physically.')
