A lot of people seem to be put-off by my usage of the word &quot;insane.&quot; I intended that as tongue-in-cheek and did not mean to imply that any of them literally have diagnosable mental illnesses. I have a lot of respect for all of the individuals I listed and they seem like nice people, I was just trying to make a point about how unusual their behavior is.<p>The post is about &#x27;how unusual their behavior is&#x27; not about &#x27;their (in)sanity&#x27;.
