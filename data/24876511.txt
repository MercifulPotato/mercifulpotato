That&#x27;s probably going to be delayed, but still people will probably be back on the Moon before the end of this decade. And this time they are saying they plan to stay.<p>&gt; Both projects have been financed through relatively undemocratic, non-market means.<p>So are LHC, ITER, the International Space Station, Project Artemis. The US is unwilling to spend the massive amounts it spent during the Apollo project on space right now, but it still spends a lot of money (NASA&#x27;s budget is about 22 billion USD a year, and the military space budget is about 14 billion USD – over 36 billion spent on space every year) and has been pretty continuously since Apollo was closed down. It would have achieved more by now if it had been spending that money more efficiently. The advent of SpaceX and other commercial providers is changing that.')
