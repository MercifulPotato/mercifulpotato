When its 100% shorted and hedge funds all need to cover, they would be the ones buying these worthless stock from sellers.  If say there are 5 hedge funds right now shorting 100% (20% each), you wouldn&#x27;t want to be the last one shorting cause the 80% short sellers that are covering could very well bankrupt your fund.  The underlying stock value doesn&#x27;t matter as long as someone else is paying for it (i.e. hedge funds).<p>That&#x27;s why business schools always say a) don&#x27;t short sell and b) don&#x27;t over leverage your short sell or you will get into a short squeeze.  Short selling in my personal opinion is really dumb because your upside is limited, but your downside is unlimited.<p>I very much suspect that this will be in the textbook in the coming years as a prime example of black swan&#x2F; short squeeze.')
