I&#x27;d be hard pushed to come up with a worse way.<p>The number of things that are &quot;wrong&quot; with reCatcha etc, have been mentioned on here <i>ad nauseam</i>.  In fact, I&#x27;ll quote myself from another debate on the subject, a while back:<p><pre><code>  &gt;1: It&#x27;s never made clear exactly what you&#x27;re supposed to click on. For example. If I&#x27;m told to click on &quot;traffic lights&quot; does that mean just the lights?... or the poles as well?... and what about a square that only has a tiny bit in it? Does that count too, or is it only squares which are mostly filled by the object in question?\n\n  &gt;2: They make no concession to non-US English speakers. I&#x27;ve been asked to identify things before, where I had to guess what the word means because the same thing is called something completely different in UK English.\n\n  &gt;The only thing that approaches the level of rage that reCaptchas instil in me are those captchas where you&#x27;ve got to transcribe what&#x27;s in a photo of some letters &amp; numbers and where they NEVER fecking tell you whether it&#x27;s case sensitive or not, or where they use identical characters for zero and letter O, one and letter I, etc.</code></pre>')
