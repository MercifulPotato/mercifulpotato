Much in the same way as writing a garbage collector is theoretically an undecidable problem and yet we have no lack of garbage collectors around, I expect research in this topic to move forward and eventually produce algorithms and methods that can be put in production software.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that (yet again, pretty much like garbage collectors) you are serving multiple masters here. We want the API to be a reasonable approximation to the actual real arithmetic, while at the same time being efficient enough that it&#x27;s usable in practice, while at the same time being intuitive enough to match people&#x27;s expectation of how real numbers &#x27;should&#x27; work.<p>Again, we already have a solution to that problem. It&#x27;s called &#x27;using floating points&#x27;. The case being made is that &#x27;using floating points&#x27; is hard and prone to error, because it satisfies requirements (1) and (2) but fails spectacularly at (3).<p>Of course people with (relatively) sophisticated math knowledge are going to be able to work it out no matter what, the same way people are able to work with floating points right now, and very efficiently so. We all took Numerical Analysis in college.  The issue is that the kind of problems raised by using floating points are hard to think about, require very specific knowledge, and cause bugs that are hard to even detect.<p>Because a model that considers <i>all</i> computable real numbers would be similarly unintuitive, we should restrict ourselves to a smaller set that works in a more intuitive way. How should that set work is a HARD problem.')
