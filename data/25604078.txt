Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609516278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601277, text='I think that there is a big difference in how easy it is to capture the, I don&#x27;t know, &quot;general musical identity&quot; of a TB or TR with a much less constrained drum machine or bassline synth. FM synths like the DX7 are notoriously difficult to control, it&#x27;s as if they were deliberately amplifying the tiniest differences.<p>If a piece of music can &quot;sound Roland x0x&quot; even if it was made on an entirely different process and any arguments about possible lack of an actual Roland in the production is strictly the realm of nerd nitpicking. Everyone else simply enjoys (or doesn&#x27;t, but not because of lack of synth authenticity). But if a musician goes for &quot;that FM sound&quot; chances are the result will be very different depending on what actual synth is used.')
