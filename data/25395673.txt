The memory was starting to fail, and I figured it was finally due.  I&#x27;ve replaced the GPU a couple of times, and upgraded storage but that&#x27;s about it.<p>It&#x27;s a nice boost for certain workloads that thread well, but it&#x27;s not a huge boost for single threaded workloads except for certain specialised stuff where there are newer instructions to take advantage of.<p>Contrast that to a roughly comparable time frame: 486sx 60Mhz -&gt; Athlon 1Ghz.<p>Short of a major revolution, I expect this CPU&#x2F;Memory will last me just as long.')
