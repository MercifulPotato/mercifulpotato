Not going to implement that for Krita either.<p>I&#x27;m curious why? I&#x27;m not trying to start anything, but I remember this discussion from a few months ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23509914" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23509914</a><p>&gt; I wish my predecessor at Krita had made that choice (sqlite), instead of choosing to re-use the KOffice xml-based file format that&#x27;s basically a zip file with stuff in it. It would have made adding the animation feature so much easier.<p>To summarize the benefits to something like sqlite over zip+xml (not all were made by that author) is; update in place means not having to overwrite the whole file, not inventing xml format for describing an image, not needing to keep the entire representation in-memory, a longer saving process is more fragile, incremental loading.')
