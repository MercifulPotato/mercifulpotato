Whether that&#x27;s true even with additional layers like lightning remains to be seen perhaps.<p>People who either missed out on the rise, sold early or lost money trading it in the past. Frustrated or bitter perhaps, wanting to be right about Bitcoin so much that they&#x27;ve shut out any possibility that it will succeed.<p>And I guess people who don&#x27;t quite understand the technology, purpose or possibilities Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies bring to the table.<p>And obviously all the &quot;tether scam&quot; people.<p>There is positive and negative to cryptocurrencies, same as there is with the internet itself. Do we wish for the internet to fail (if somehow that were even possible) because it enabled mass manipulation of people through social media? Well maybe some people do but I think the vast majority take the good with the bad and some are working to try and solve these problems.<p>Will Bitcoin fail? I don&#x27;t think it can at this point to be honest. Genie is out of the bottle, interest is there and it&#x27;s getting more legitimized every day, whether it&#x27;s through the direct actions taken by individuals, companies or institutions to further the entire space or through the inaction of governments who don&#x27;t want to stifle innovation or possibly don&#x27;t see it as the threat to the monetary system it could (potentially)_be.<p>Time will tell!')
