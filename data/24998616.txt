The wires don&#x27;t really seem to ever get crossed for me. When I&#x27;m using intelliJ, I honestly find that I&#x27;m not really typing all that much. I&#x27;m either reading&#x2F;navigating code (and therefore ctrl-clicking on identifiers or using shortcuts for finding usages etc), or typing in a pretty linear fashion that is the sort of thing I&#x27;d be in insert mode for the entire block anyway. So when I spend most of my time navigating&#x2F;reading, it feels really good to have a robust first-class experience with the relevant features in your chosen environment. I know vim can do all that stuff, but it&#x27;s all tacked on and never (IME) doesn&#x27;t feel tasked on. Whereas the IDE understands the semantics (the AST) in a way that vim&#x2F;ctags likely never will.<p>Some of this is particularly strong due to the language I use most - Java - where the IDE is nearly bulletproof in terms of finding exactly, only, and all real usages of identifiers (it won&#x27;t ever get confused by two different identifiers with the same name) which isn&#x27;t true for pycharm&#x2F;python (though it does a good job honestly, but you can&#x27;t blindly trust it like you can with intelliJ). I could see how someone would find pycharm not quite as much of a win over ctags, though IMO it still is.<p>[edit] That said, I still use vim quite a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for editing config files or just examining text content. Especially since you can pipe to it - seldom a day goes by when I don&#x27;t &quot;| vim -&quot; instead of less or anything else.')
