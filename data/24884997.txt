So no driver needed and you can use them for the TV or whatever. Another benefit is the excelent range and low lag compared to bluetooth. Ergonomics also, pick them from base and they turn on and &quot;pair&quot; instantly. Most (all? are without microphone though. Sennheiser RS 195 for example has decent sound. I owned a cheaper Panasonic one.<p>BT is very convenient for me for work. I own Bose Quiercomfort 35 II. Active noise cancelation, simultaneus phone and laptop connection. Good sound quality. Range is very small compared to RF, lag, linux BT in headset mode has bad quality. Occasional pairing issues all solved in 1 minute but annoying.<p>My wired set is Sony MDR-1AM2. Same price range as the Bose. The sound quality is so far ahead of the BT that I can&#x27;t listen to music on the Bose without feeling cheated. You just plug them to whatever you need and don&#x27;t worry about anything, battery, range or interference, pairing, etc. Comfort is also better because of the weight.<p>Overall I would say unless you have some special need wireless is more headaches and low quality sound. Get a good wired pair of phones with microphone (my Sony has it) and get a cheap true wireless pair for the road (I have Xiaomi TWE 2) and that&#x27;s it.')
