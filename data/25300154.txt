If I&#x27;m in terminal I can copy that text with the path, hit cmd n &quot;open&quot; cmd v enter and view the image with the system viewer (preview in this case). If I&#x27;m looking at the text file in textedit on mac os, I can actually do this from the right click menu under services after highlighting the path name. Could be a good solution if you are tired of onenote&#x27;s bloat.')
