The physical metaphor of dragging stuff works for me, too, and—while the Vim folks might ridicule me—I think the computer mouse is actually quite excellent and fills in the gaps quicker than remembering keyboard shortcuts for some things. Also really great for when I&#x27;m drunk, because I&#x27;m not in the mood to play spy games with the desktop when I just want the window to <i>go over there</i>.
