Given any exceptional condition deep down in a program, assuming appropriate restarts are bound, it can pop the debugger and let you choose how to proceed, but handlers can also be bound to handle conditions &#x2F; invoke restarts programmatically. Restarts may be bound at different layers of granularity so if you had a command operating on a set of files, one one of them fails to open, the avaiable restarts might be &quot;Retry command&quot;, &quot;Skip this file&quot;, &quot;Retry open&quot;, &quot;Provide alternate filename&quot;, etc. It&#x27;s sort of a missing link between interactive and batch&#x2F;scriptable environments that current operating systems are missing.<p>(My Common Lisp is getting rusty, sorry if I&#x27;ve slightly jubmled the condition&#x2F;handler&#x2F;restart lingo)')
