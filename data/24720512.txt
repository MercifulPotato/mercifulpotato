Item(by='StrictDabbler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602173580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718944, text='Did BMW learn a lot from the nine production years where their chassis cracked so badly that the wheel supports reliably tore away from the rear subframe? Or the control arms bearings that would disintegrate every 50k? The rear differential bushings and the GUIBO flex disc that both require regular replacement to prevent the car destroying itself?<p>Not to mention the little stuff, like the window regulators and sunroof self-destructing, the ignition tumbler corroding and disabling the car&#x27;s internal bus so the lights freaked out, or the headlight mountings disintegrating.<p>As the owner of an E46 that I purchased used at 100k and now sits defunct at 155k I&#x27;m baffled by your comment. I&#x27;d fix everything on that car and four unrelated things would break the next month. &quot;Preventive maintenance&quot; wasn&#x27;t oil changes and brake pads... it consisted of half-replacing major systems at regular intervals.<p>Maybe they just got their shit together on the newer models, but yeesh.')
