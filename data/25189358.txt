This game is <i>amazing</i> and they are producing Rogue Legacy 2 right now.<p>It gets even better once you realize there are speedrunners who are able to beat the game in 5 minutes. Watch and try to copy them lol.<p>I also remember enjoying that Roguelike game that is a sequel to Final Fantasy X-2. I know it&#x27;s not FF X-3, the name is something else, but I can&#x27;t google it now.')
