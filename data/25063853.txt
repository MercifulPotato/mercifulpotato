By my count, they want to be a:<p><pre><code>  * Todo list &#x2F; task manager &#x2F; long-term planner\n  * Blogging&#x2F;publishing platform\n  * Internal wiki\n  * Note-taking app\n</code></pre>\nOne of the more cynical takes I&#x27;ve heard is that this is the result of an incredible product sense without the necessary direction to support it. Regardless of the reason, they seem to be releasing features without a coherent narrative of how they grow the company&#x27;s placement and who their target user is. Previous companies which have done this (e.g. Evernote) grow really quickly with a lot of user-love and then stagnated in growth without a clear sense of what to do next.<p>With all that said, I&#x27;m a happy notion user, so maybe they&#x27;re onto something...<p>I wonder if internally they have that sense of direction (e.g. they want to compete head-on with Monday) and, if so, how scoped it is (e.g. do they want to replace ALL internal tools &#x2F; do they think that&#x27;s tractable)?')
