If things fit&#x2F;stick to each other really well (think lock and key fitting, glove to hand idea), they only need to bump into each other a couple time before they lock together. This study shows that a thing on the virus sticks to a thing on a cell (Neuropillin-1) really well. What this does is then keep the virus really close to the cell so it can bump into the other thing (ACE2) more often. This is important because ACE2 is how the virus gets into the cell. So the first thing (Neuropillin-1 binding) sticks the virus to the cell and gives it more time to find the entry switch (ACE2). Without that first binding (from Neuropillin-1), the number of times the virus bumps into ACE2 is not a lot because there isn&#x27;t much of it on the cells.')
