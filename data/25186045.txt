The medical industry tends to be paranoid to a level that exceeds rationality and even if they dropped their standards for this that should only get them down to &quot;conservative and rather safe&quot; levels of caution.<p>On the other, a cursory search says the current record for fastest developed vaccine was mumps at 4 years. So this is a vaccine setting new milestones, and there is a risk that not all of them will be positive. I&#x27;d rather be a little late to be vaccinated than a little early, especially being in a lower risk demographic.')
