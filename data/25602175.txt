Really I’m talking about the mass use of glyphosate in farming - the uses in this linked video aren’t that bad - but the confident and carefree voice over reminded me of the asbestos video.<p>Anyway in another 50 years time we may look back on videos like this the same way we look at the asbestos video.')
