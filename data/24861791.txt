I imagine if someone used the same exact printer (Prusa i3 MK3), the same exact filament (eSun), my same exact settings (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;3d&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;settings&#x2F;slic3r-config-bundle-esun-petg.ini" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dheera&#x2F;3d&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;settings&#x2F;slic3r-con...</a>), and my same exact textured bed sheet, same exact procedure (Windex, then Magigoo, then print), they should have zero problems as well. It&#x27;s not even tricky. It prints just like PLA with this &quot;recipe&quot;.<p>The only problem seems to be that there is a lot of conflicting information about what works for PETG but people just need to think in terms of configuration sets like the above. If you use the Prusa PETG settings with eSun filament it fails miserably -- the prints come off the bed mid-print.')
