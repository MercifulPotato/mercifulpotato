First of all thanks for the mention. Also your calculator’s battery dying that early is <i>not</i> normal, I’m very sorry to hear that. We’re doing everything we can to preserve battery life (namely, low charge current, no over-charging, and very low discharge current), and our most pessimistic estimates give us at least 10 years of battery life. If you send us an email at contact@numworks.com I’m pretty sure you would qualify for a free replacement.<p>On a different note, and regarding the original link: we actually were the first to introduce Python on a graphing calculator in 2017. We opted for (and contributed to) MicroPython. Three years later, all of our competitors have copied us :-)')
