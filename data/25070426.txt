The API supports batching calls across the interop barrier, so that the interop performance costs are minimized.\nAs for Blazor being slow: please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but my understanding, that Blazor code is interpreted, because JIT compilation in wasm is not really possible. The implementation of AoT compilation, which will fix the perf issues is coming along, but it&#x27;s not quite there yet.')
