There are No repercussions (in my locale, NLD) for breaking the law as a public servant. Even when the statutes are quite broad (like knowingly infringing on a law or the constitution by a very senior public servant or knowingly holding money for public benefit that shouldn&#x27;t be held &#x2F; restituted) there are literally zero prosecutions of these events.<p>And I&#x27;ve gone quite deep even contacting the police agency especially created for such things (they don&#x27;t even track complaints against these statutes) and searching the public database with judgements. The only thing we do is persecute clear graft. So the worst thing that could happen left is one government office getting fined by another, which is somewhat disappointing. It&#x27;s taxes afteral going around. All I have for my deep-dive is a professor agreeing with me (hey N=2 beats N=1).')
