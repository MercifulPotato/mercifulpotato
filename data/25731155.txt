Perhaps not in the area of security, but we can point at plenty of other companies that were discovered to be lacking in this area at relatively early stages of their lifecycles (e.g., Zoom), not to mention a few very mature organisations (e.g., Intel!).<p>One of the things that&#x27;s incredibly unhelpful in our current political debates is that there exists a very noisy (at least) minority on both sides of every one of those debates that assumes all the people on the other side are idiots. In general this is not true[0] and so, yes, even though Parler was a social network explicitly for conservatives, they would still have been able to hire smart people.<p>I don&#x27;t say that Parler was for extremists, although an extremist contingent was certainly present, but it&#x27;s worth remembering that even those that are unequivocally and uncontroversially agreed to be extremists by the vast majority of people (Bin Laden, Stalin, Hitler[1], et al) were always able to &quot;hire&quot;, or perhaps disciple, very smart people.<p>Being smart is not the same thing as being ethical, by which what I really mean in this context is sharing the same set of ethics that you have.<p>(On a tangentially related note to both my first and last paragraphs, Boeing employ a very large number of very smart people and yet, as the 737 Max debacle clearly illustrates, they were nursing some absolutely horrendous culturual issues that led to a situation where that airliner was certified and sold even though it contained systems that incorporated severe safety failings.)<p><i>[0] And the culture of endless cheap shots, snobbish intellectualism, and disrespectful dismissiveness that surrounds political debate these days is not a force for good in the world.</i><p><i>[1] At the risk of invoking Godwin&#x27;s law.</i>')
