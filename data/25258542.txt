Can you learn exact truth from inexact examples?<p>Which gets into the concept of whether the ML model has <i>actually</i> learned some deeper conceptual ideas than we have, some deeper truth about how this works. If so, can we somehow extract that truth, or is it truly a black box that does the thing we want?<p>I&#x27;m reminded of a sci-fi book I read long ago in which humans are discussing the fact that the science they are utilizing is beyond the scope of a human mind to comprehend- only the AIs can intuitively deal with 12-dimensional manifolds (or something to that extent). Maybe we&#x27;ve reached the doorstep of that future.')
