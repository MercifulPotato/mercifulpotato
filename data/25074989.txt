Then.<p>I&#x27;ll save myself some time and just skip to The Correct Answer:<p>Made-to-order is the next growth opportunity. (Fast fashion has been played out.)<p>I&#x27;d watch someone like StitchFix or Trunk Club. They&#x27;ll shorten the supply chain somehow (partnership, M&amp;A, investment). Start offering made to order on select items. Strategically.<p>They&#x27;ll need to do better measurements. Add MTailor features or equivalent.<p>Some are doing pop-ups, concierge. I&#x27;m now bearish on that approach. Mostly because of coronavirus. But I just can&#x27;t think of any of the current players getting that kind of smart. I&#x27;ll be delighted if someone proves me wrong.<p>I tuned out about 18mo ago. So haven&#x27;t kept up. I&#x27;m told there&#x27;s an MTailor like thing for sizing glasses.<p>I still don&#x27;t have a clue how someone can do remote shoe sizing. Right now, everything&#x27;s inferred from returns. But that&#x27;s like diagnosing TBIs using phrenology.<p>I&#x27;m sure Amazon will continue to try any thing and everything. I haven&#x27;t looked at their latest fashion effort. Mostly because whatever they do is a non-starter. Authenticity is table stakes for fashion, fast fashion, and therefore made to order. They&#x27;ll certainly steal other people&#x27;s lunch money, but are otherwise constitutionally incapable of anything new. Further, Amazon is entirely wholly hostile to authenticity. For them to pivot towards would invalidate their raison d&#x27;Ãªtre. It <i>could</i> happen. I&#x27;m just betting against.<p><i>&quot;...when applied to ~$200 items?&quot;</i><p>You crack me up.')
