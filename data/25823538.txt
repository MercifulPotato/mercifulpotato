So people:\nA) do it for just fun &#x2F; student projects (None of those ones are though).\nB) do it because they have a nontrivially resolvable opinion (e.g. Queryverse has a marginally more performant but marginally harder to use system for missing data)<p>Nice thing about julia, especially for tabular data (thanks to Tables.jl), is everything works together.\nIt&#x27;s actually completely possible to mix and match all of those libraries in a single data processing pipeline.\nWhich while is generally a weird thing to do, it does mean if you have a external package uses any of them it works into a pipeline of another.\n(One common case is that queryverse has CSVFiles.jl, but CSV.jl actually is generally faster, and you can just swap one for ther other, inside a Query.jl pipeline)<p>I absolutely argee this makes learning harder.<p>---<p>Also  that particular example:<p>&gt; &quot;I need pipes to help me wrangle data more efficiently do I use Base Julia, Chain.jl, Pipe.jl, or Lazy.jl?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s piping.\nSomething would have to massively be screwed up if any of those options were more or less efficient than the others.\nThe only question is what semantics do you want.\nEach is pretty opinionated about how piping should look.')
