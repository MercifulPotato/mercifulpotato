Drinking DURING the day was encouraged? So the famed company culture is to let everyone get drunk as long as they&#x27;re all hitting targets? Recipe for disaster for anyone who stays a significant amount of time. It seems cool when you&#x27;re young then after 10 years people start getting serious problems like alcoholic neuropathy. Very sad situation all round.')
