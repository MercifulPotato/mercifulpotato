Its about giving a voice to the generations that existed before us, and what they have to tell us about how societies function and how to optimize for human happiness. The alternative is making up the rules of how civilisation works from first principles using a rationalist blank slate, which went horribly wrong when the communists did it, and goes completely off the rails right now [0].<p>The idea that we are rational decision-making machines, where all you have to do is to allow maximum freedom of decision making on an individual level, and you will automatically arrive at a happiness maximum, turns out not to be true. Communities are important, (shared) values are important, the right norms are important. There is much of value to be learned. It is <i>not</i> about accepting all the old ideas, because norms are evolving for good reasons, but instead take a hard look and evaluate which ones actually made a lot of sense.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;swipewright&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340199529891549184?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;swipewright&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340199529891549184?s...</a>')
