GPU support on ARM is anyway not that great to begin with.<p>&gt; What people are describing as &quot;Open&quot; is actually an enormous amount of work on the part of developers and the grudging support of hardware vendors after decades of struggle.<p>Intel has Linux dedicated teams at least, pushing FOSS code every single day. Most ARM licensees could not care one bit about FOSS.')
