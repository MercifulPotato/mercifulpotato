In fact, most regulators <i>aren&#x27;t there to kill you</i>. They just want to know you have a plan that builds towards compliance over time.<p>There is admittedly a difference in the stakes and severity of enforcement in different verticals; but it&#x27;s more than possible to comply. In fact, zealous compliance can actually get regulations rewritten and unmask systemic fraud&#x2F;non-compliance in established actors if you do it right. Everyone should be meeting the same goals, but if you have one company struggling to honestly do so, it&#x27;s a sign to look into tge mechanisms other actors have in place and whether they actually do what is on the tin. EPA learned that indirectly the hard way with Dieselgate.')
