Register your videos and images with the USCO. It&#x27;ll cost &lt;$100.<p>2. You can now file DMCA takedowns. Send one to Apple with the USCO registration ID and a copy of the image and a link to the app in question.<p>3. Apple will either immediately remove that fake app, or be liable for up to $350k in punitive damages for wilful infringement and lose all DMCA protection.<p>4. If Apple didn&#x27;t react a week later, approach a lawyer. They&#x27;ll likely be willing to work purely for 50% commission, because it&#x27;ll be a slam dunk in court.<p>5. Repeat the same with Facebook &#x2F; Youtube if they advertise there with your images or videos. Take Screenshots and write down the url and date and time.<p>Of course, one would hope that Apple will do the right thing, but it&#x27;s also reasonably easy to force their hand.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t know anyone for whom app development worked out financially if you fairly price your own labor. So maybe just stay away from cheap apps in general.')
