Engineers  are always  interested in keeping formulas as simple or compact as possible, and we illustrate that geometric algebra does provide such a simplified representation in many cases. We also demonstrate an additional structural check provided by GA for formulas in addition to the usual checking of physical dimensions. Naturally, there is an initial learning curve when applying a new method, but it appears to be worth the effort, as we show significantly simplified formulas, greater intuition, and  improved problem solving in many cases.')
