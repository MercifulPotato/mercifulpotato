Earlier this year, people protesting coronavirus lockdowns were called &quot;fascists.&quot; People protesting against government authority were called fascists.<p>Berkeley had to spend $600k in security to allow Ben Shapiro to speak, because &quot;anti fascists&quot; were accusing him of white supremacy, and being a fascist, and violently attempting to prevent him from speaking. And this was after they had successfully prevented him from speaking earlier in the year. Similar &quot;anti fascists&quot; pulled the fire alarm on Janice Fiamengo for speaking about men&#x27;s issues. Warren Farrel had a similar experience, with people absolutely berating the attendants of one of his lectures for their support of fascism.')
