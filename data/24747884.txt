It&#x27;s just as practical, from the programmer&#x27;s standpoint. 64 bits worth of nanoseconds gives abundant range (Â±292 years from the origin) and microsecond times already necessitate a 64-bit representation (2^31 microseconds only gets you half an hour). So you can build all your protocols around signed 64-bit nanos from a defined origin and never need to change it again.')
