There are many laws (e.g. accounting) that only apply to companies, when it&#x27;s scale that amplifies harm.<p>&gt; <i>possession, not use</i><p>How are they different, in this context? The latter requires the former, and the former is unprofitable without the latter.<p>&gt; <i>how are you going to audit Ford or Geico?</i><p>As you note, similarly to how we audit now, albeit hopefully more proactively. If the law requires a signed off third-party PII audit, and holds an auditor legally liable for signing off on one... I expect the problem would (mostly) take care of itself.<p>PII is always going to be a game of edge cases, but we&#x27;ve managed to make it work with PCI and PHI in similarly messy domains.<p>Right now, companies have GDPR &amp; CCPA to nudge them in data architecture. National laws would just further that. I can attest to major companies retooling how they handle and track consumer data just due to the CCPA.')
