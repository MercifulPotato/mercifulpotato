I like to carry ideas between them for my development and environments. Found this extremely fruitful for me over the years.<p>We ordered a bunch of M1 airs for portability and power efficiency. Will see how it goes.<p>I personally love both Linux and Apple for laptops but, for the out of the box experience and reliability, Apple is more polished due to integration. My EliteBook has no problems with Linux so far but, when a flawlessly running driver degrades after an update (cough, <i>intel e1000e</i>, cough), it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. OTOH, I&#x27;m firstly a Linux guy who prefers and writes GPL software.<p>Of course YMMV.')
