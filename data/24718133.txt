Item(by='thethirdone', descendants=None, kids=[24718709], score=None, time=1602157024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717939, text='&gt; To me, I might get drawn into some topic&#x2F;debate and eventually conclude that it&#x27;s just boring semantics. At that point, the whole thing annoys me whenever it comes up. This was how I &quot;got sick of philosophy&quot; at Uni.<p>I would like to take a stab at explaining why an argument being &quot;boring semantics&quot; or &quot;interesting philosophy&quot; is somewhat dependent on perspective.<p>To be explicit about definitions I take &quot;semantics&quot; to mean &quot;mapping from words&#x2F;sentences to a concrete meaning&quot; and &quot;arguing semantics&quot; to mean &quot;Arguing what mapping is <i>correct</i> or agreeing on a shared mapping&quot;.<p>To give a concrete example of an argument (from the article):<p>&gt; Abortion is the canonical example of this type of argument: once you have decided what “life” is, there’s really not much else to discuss.  It’s not a political argument, not even in theory.  It’s purely a semantic one.<p>Deciding what &quot;life&quot; is by my definitions a purely semantic argument. As you try to define &quot;life&quot;, you will want to keep almost universally agreed upon statements such as &quot;Human life has inherent value&quot; coherent. Some of the simplest definitions will raise issues if you start considering future and past humans. There are some interesting questions that you can try to answer by defining &quot;life&quot; and following the logical consequences. However, if you are only interested in abortion, most of the subtly of a definition of &quot;life&quot; is not relevant.<p>So if you are interested in only the first question you ask, arguing semantics can be a deep rabbit hole, but if you are willing to entertain new questions as you primary question, it can be interesting as its own study.')
