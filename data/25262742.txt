Apple have pretty strong EULAs.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s licensing for clouds is also a pain in the arse.  You (the cloud platform) have to pay for a full months license the moment an instance is created.  The way it&#x27;s structured you have some wriggle room, e.g. you have your placement algorithm land new instances on where Windows instances have already been in a given month, so you don&#x27;t incur additional licenses (because the license &quot;transfers&quot;).  It gets worse if you start wanting to do things like run SQL Servers, where it&#x27;s the entire month license outright with no prorating, and it applies to a specific <i>instance</i> instead of the machine&#x2F;VM slot.<p>Strangely enough, despite all the trends in the market, operating system vendors are determined to make it <i>harder</i> for people to pay them to use their stuff, rather than <i>easier</i>.')
