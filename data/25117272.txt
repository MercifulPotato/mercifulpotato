It made perfect sense. By all indications, Sweden should have enjoyed a flat and sustainable level of infections. While this level may have been higher than neighbouring countries, the fact that it would have remained constant while other countries&#x27; would have surged as governments loosened restrictions and people stopped paying attention to them meant that Sweden&#x27;s was the winning strategy for a pandemic that would be with us for several years.<p>Why did this not pan out? Why is Sweden seeing a second wave as well? Why did the number of infections soar, while it should theoretically have remained constant?')
