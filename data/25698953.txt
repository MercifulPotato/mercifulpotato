Yes there was millions of dollars worth of damage done here by looting but thats barely scratching the surface of what happened. The siege of the federal courthouse and central police station involved crazy violent actions on a daily basis, but there was no national outcry to dox and arrest the people responsible for that. People (not &quot;nazis&quot;, some not republican&#x2F;conservative) within blocks of my home have been murdered, beaten, businesses shot up (like the black owned sandwich shop across the street from my apartment because the owner &quot;supported the police&quot;) yet there was no deplatforming for the leftist extremists responsible for this. I speak from what I saw right in front of me, what I heard from my living room and bedroom day after day for months, I&#x27;m sure there are similar stories from all over the country. Maybe I&#x27;m biased by personal experience but it just seems like if angry white kids smash stuff up and say shout some leftist slogans while they&#x27;re doing it they get a pass but if the angry white kids shout &quot;Trump 2020, something something&quot; while they&#x27;re doing the same stuff suddenly its sedition and terrorism.')
