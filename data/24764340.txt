Claiming something else easily constitutes voter suppression. I don&#x27;t know what laws the US has around this but I imagine a court could easily criminally punish entities for doing this.<p>However - especially when it comes to covid, you really are in gray areas. And even the authority makes mistakes, how do you then &quot;fact check it&quot;? When the WHO claims in january its not airborne, or Fauci says don&#x27;t wear masks one month, and wear them a month later? When the WHO says lock down your countries, and just this week says actually you shouldn&#x27;t? Hydroxychloroquine was used in many countries, by medical doctors. Just because trump said he is taking it doesn&#x27;t make it a conspiracy theory. At the time there were legitimate doctors trying legitimate theories. Even if it turned out to be false, it&#x27;s ridiculous to claim this issue is black and white.')
