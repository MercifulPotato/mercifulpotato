I think an earlier version of the comment in my head had &quot;killed&quot; instead of &quot;starved&quot; but that would include war casualties which are more ambiguous so the innocent thing. Either way, it was incoherent and you&#x27;re right that &quot;people&quot; was a better choice of word. English isn&#x27;t my native language but it&#x27;s no excuse because I&#x27;ve been speaking and writing in it for years.<p>&gt;To address the main point, history is full of this.\nI agree, but I do feel it is relevant to acknowledge the portions of someone&#x27;s legacy that aren&#x27;t clean. The quote in isolation is a fair and fine one, I suppose. I would show more restraint in bringing up the cursory comment on Churchill if the context of the thread was something else entirely.')
