I am not entirely convinced if it was a terrorist attack.<p>It does fit FBI definition ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;investigate&#x2F;terrorism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;investigate&#x2F;terrorism</a> ), but that definition is rather broad to begin with. To me attack suggests some level of planning, forethought, end game even it is just to terrorize. FBI definition also does not seem to indicate that terrorist attacks are typically directed towards civilians ( government buildings are not civilians ).<p>But if we accept FBI definition then what political end was achieved by this? Clearly not the intended one.<p>Again. I think this is just another Patriot Act moment. We can calm down or go down another rabbit hole. Only this time, we will have to TSA every time we want to talk to a government official.')
