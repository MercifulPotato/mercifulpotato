The notion that &quot;you have to accept the arrogance and obnoxious attitude of high level software engineers because it is inevitable that the type of people who excel at creating software are that way because they don&#x27;t focus on social skills&quot;. Every one of us can work to be more polite and caring of the emotions of others. Especially if you know you suck at it you ought to use effort to be better in that way.<p>Justifying treating others poorly just enables more people being hurt. We should not reward people for this sort of behavior. Turning a blind eye to it because &quot;they are great software engineers&quot; is not right.<p>Your comment treads very much into the &quot;for the greater good&quot; mentality where you can justify anything based on the results.<p>&quot;Unique character trait&quot; my ass. Obnoxious aholes are just that. Obnoxious aholes. They need to fucking stop and be more kind.')
