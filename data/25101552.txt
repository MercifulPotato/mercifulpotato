It&#x27;s not a small number of cases anymore.<p>I read the documentation they put out about their plan to deal with this. The plan failed.<p>Currently these mutated cases are the biggest risk to this entire process, bigger even than wild type.<p>The only way to stop them is to immunize people against the subtype but they no longer are immunizing people because the immunization itself causes more mutated cases.<p>So this new mutated vaccine derived polio is spreading unchecked because young children are not immunized to it.<p>I suspect they may need to switch to using IPV to immunize, people but it will be ferociously expensive.')
