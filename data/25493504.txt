This is solution (1) and this is due to the restriction that prior to C++20 iterators were required to be the same type. C++20 relaxes this restriction and allows the sentinel to be any type as long as it is equality comparable with the other iterator. Since on *nix systems readdir is used under the hood, the sentinel can simply be an empty type that is only equal when the actual iterator&#x27;s last cached dirent pointer is equal to NULL. The sentinel itself can be an empty type.')
