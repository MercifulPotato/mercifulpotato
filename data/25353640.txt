Elite students from upper strata will probably pull farther away (though may or may not suffer as compared to the counterfactual non-pandemic case).<p>To use your model, what you say is possible, but I think it&#x27;s equally possible that the delta is additive rather than multiplicative. A 20% student and a 100% student might both lose 10% or 20% to [10%, 90%] or [0%, 80%] without intervention by involved parents.<p>My kids (grade 4 and 6) are getting a ton of dedicated 1:1 time including more coding time, paid math programs they enjoy playing, white-boarding problems with us, watching Nova&#x2F;Nasa&#x2F;other science content with us, and a lot more reading than if they were chained to a desk learning 2 hours of material in 6.5 hours. They might do better in this half school, half home school situation.')
