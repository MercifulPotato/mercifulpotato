In many cases, clients may be talking directly to 1.1.1.1, not servers. At least that is a pattern I have seen people using.  Only servers validate DNSSEC.  So people using Unbound DNS at home or in their corporate network may be protected from this, but I am not aware of any local OS resolvers that validate DNSSEC.  You are right though, people should certainly be using DNSSEC on all their zones.')
