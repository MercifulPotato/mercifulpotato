Item(by='kace91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603107996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825057, text='Are you in disagreement with the point of my comment, or just the way it&#x27;s worded? Perhaps I can explain what I mean better:<p>New features, by itself, aren&#x27;t the only way technology moves forward, even thought it&#x27;s the more noticeable and entertaining way.  An improvement in the way existing features are accessed, or even a protection for certain features being accessed in a way that&#x27;s potentially wrong, can also be an improvement or innovation. Static typing, enforced linters, or the Rust borrow checker are good examples of restriction-as-a-feature.<p>Therefore, I disagree with the original comment&#x27;s implication that restricting features in lieu of security or misuse is a blocker for innovation.')
