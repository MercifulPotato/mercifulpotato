So to come up with some sort of experiment, you&#x27;d need some sort or prognostic based on biomarkers that was strong and convincing enough to think it was related to what you&#x27;re predicting, which we definitely don&#x27;t have yet. Then you&#x27;d need to cross tab between effects. Potentially possible, but it relies on a pretty big discovery that would have better uses!')
