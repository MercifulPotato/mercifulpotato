Wonderful headphones, and I did some mod where you remove some foam inside the earcups which effectively makes them like the next model up (not sure which guide I followed, but this [0] might have been it).<p>As I mention in the article I&#x27;m not a fan of Bluetooth, though I do use that on mobile devices. Some have better connection and codec support (depends on Bluetooth version and phone too). I have to say the Corsair wireless headset I reviewed and use, has been quite good. Audio quality in terms of wireless is great, never a problem there. I haven&#x27;t tried to specifically measure lag, but nothing I noticed at least.<p>So I can compare more directly with what you know in the HD555. The Senn&#x27;s are more comfortable (lighter, a little softer in all places) and have a clearer, more natural sound, to me. The Corsair&#x27;s sound good to me as well, but tuned differently (as I wrote, more multimedia focused). I haven&#x27;t tried equalizers, but that&#x27;s always an option.<p>The wireless freedom is great. I use a wired keyboard and mouse at the desk, but headphones always have a wire moving around the desk, getting caught on something, or just annoying if I want to get up and move a little in the room.<p>Happy to answer any other questions. For me, the Corsair hits a nice price point and quality, works well for what I want. The higher end wireless ones quickly get more expensive, and I&#x27;d imagine that money would get you more in a non-wireless set, at least in terms of listening quality.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikebeauchamp.com&#x2F;misc&#x2F;sennheiser-hd-555-to-hd-595-mod&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikebeauchamp.com&#x2F;misc&#x2F;sennheiser-hd-555-to-hd-595-mo...</a>')
