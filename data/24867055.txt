Much like yourself, I now use it for most of my productivity tasks. All of my blog posts are now mostly written on the iPad, and I love the pencil and magic keyboard. At first it seems overly expensive, but it is very much well worth the money if you can afford it.<p>It took me a while to learn 2 fingers on the screen is undo and 3 is redo, and that&#x27;s really as much as I know for gesture control. The split screen is nice, but like you say, there&#x27;s definitely room for improvement.<p>Thanks for reading, and I enjoy your comment and thoughts. :)')
