Netflix was first in streaming, but streaming is just a delivery mechanism, the real product is the content and (but for a one-off) they haven&#x27;t radically transformed that. Netflix isn&#x27;t â€œfragmenting&quot;, movies and serialized shows are moving from TV&#x2F;Cable (and, recently, theaters) to streaming for delivery.')
