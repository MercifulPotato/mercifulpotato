I have a personal XPS. I have an Android phone (because I can flash my own roms).<p>The chargers that ship with modern devices tend to be USB-C to USB-C (including Apple&#x27;s own macbook charger).<p>I have absolutely no desire to fit a lightning cable into my life, and I&#x27;m hardly the only person I know who has a macbook and an android phone (about half of my company of 300 falls into the <i>exact</i> same bucket).<p>I don&#x27;t typically buy Apple devices because I think they&#x27;re oppressively locked down, but that&#x27;s not really something I care that much about for headphones.<p>Plus, given the whole market for decent bluetooth headphones is ridiculously price inflated anyways, Apple&#x27;s price here doesn&#x27;t dissuade me nearly as much as normal.<p>Basically - I would absolutely consider picking up a Max, but lightning is a <i>serious</i> knock against the product.')
