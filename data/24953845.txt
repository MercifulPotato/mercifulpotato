I&#x27;m not sure how that reconciles with its being a genetic mutation, but if anyone were to tell me that I am genetically nocturnal I would absolutely believe it. Starting in my teens for decades, I would regularly be wide awake at 4 in the morning, and if I had a choice, my clock would drift so that I would naturally wake up around 1 in the afternoon.<p>I read an article on, I think it was LifeHacker, back when it was a new thing years and years and years ago. The title was something like &quot;I taught myself to be an early riser&quot; and the advice changed my life. If I could find the article, I would write a personal letter thanking the author. Given my experience, I suspect that even if you do have a genetic predisposition to stay up late and sleep late, that it can be reset, so you can wake up as early as you want. Nowadays, I rarely sleep past 7 in the morning, and I never need an alarm to wake up. I wake up reasonably cheerful and clear-headed. Here&#x27;s the advice, as I remember it. It may work for you.<p>1. First, <i>want</i> to be an early riser. In a way, that&#x27;s the only step. When you wake up in the morning, your desire to <i>be</i> an early riser must override the physical pain and exhaustion that you will inevitably feel. You&#x27;re going to want to roll over and go back under those warm, warm covers. No. Get up. Because you <i>want</i> this.<p>2. Stay up as late as you want! Yep. Read, play video games, code, do whatever it is you want to do as late as you want to do it. Heck, don&#x27;t go to sleep if you want. Go to sleep only when you&#x27;re ready.<p>Those two steps are basically it, and anything else is just elaboration. If you stay up late, you <i>will</i> feel miserable the next day, but that&#x27;s okay! Grind through. There are worse things. That night, when you start feeling peppy again, great! Stay up. Stay up as late as you want. But stick solidly to rule #1. Get up, because you <i>want</i> it.<p>Eventually, after the inevitable bouts of backsliding and days of exhaustion, your body will adjust to the new schedule and ... go to sleep at a more normal time.<p>You should start to see results within the first week, but I can say that I only could reasonably say I&#x27;m an <i>early</i> riser after several years of <i>wanting</i> it.<p>Edit --- this is it!
