Lidar isn&#x27;t new tech, but it has become cheaper, smaller, and more importantly the compute capable of processing it massively more available (e.g. under-used machine learning chips in modern smartphones).<p>Lidar for mapping objects&#x2F;rooms&#x2F;buildings&#x2F;etc. Lidar for mapping people&#x2F;yourself.<p>For example that custom countertop? No need for an in-person visit, just use Lidar to scan the space via our app, and we&#x27;ll have it delivered in 4-6 weeks.<p>You want a custom tailored suit? Just scan your whole body using Lidar, and we will custom make it to those measurements abroad and have it delivered.<p>Got into a minor vehicle accident? Just scan the damaged section, and we&#x27;ll be able to quote the exact cost of repairs.<p>Lidar is a new core&#x2F;low level sensor. It is a gimmick <i>today</i> because of the chicken&#x2F;egg problem, but we&#x27;ll see it eventually become completely standard and expected for normal life stuff. Boring stuff. AR isn&#x27;t the what it is about, that&#x27;s just an easier sales pitch.')
