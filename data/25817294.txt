Item(by='credit_guy', descendants=None, kids=[25817507], score=None, time=1610934246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815316, text='Pretty much everything that&#x27;s being manufactured today can be manufactured for 10 to 100 times cheaper. But you can&#x27;t drive the cost down if you can&#x27;t iterate enough.<p>A few hours ago I bought a smartphone for $35. It&#x27;s an LG smartphone, and while it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the latest iPhone 12 Pro, it will smoke any phone manufactured just 7 years ago. And it&#x27;s only $35.<p>Can you imagine that? Some hundreds of millions of transistors, two cameras, some wireless antennas, a GPS chip, an FM receiver, a screen with millions of colored pixels, etc, etc, for only $35. All these things would not have been available in such a small package 20 years ago, and they would have cost thousands of dollars in any size. Now they fit in something that&#x27;s 100 grams heavy and costs $35.<p>So, yes, a large reactor costs $20 BN today, a small reactor is probably of the order of $1 BN, but a small reactor allows you to iterate. Once you are able to iterate, there&#x27;s nothing that stops that cost from going down by a factor of 10 or 100, just like the cost of solar and wind went down.')
