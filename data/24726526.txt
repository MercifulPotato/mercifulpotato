People should be grateful that they have their job at McBurgerchain even though it only pays minimum wage and 120hrs&#x2F;wk at that minimum wage might not be enough to pay for rent and food in their area, if they can even get 120hrs across 3 jobs (they probably can&#x27;t).<p>If you look at a lot of the chatter that leads towards discussions of unionization in workplaces these days, it&#x27;s really mundane stuff and not Politics or Socialism. People talking about blatantly abusive employer behavior, wage theft, poor safety&#x2F;hygiene, bad benefits, etc - an employer can easily mitigate a lot of this stuff and have happy workers who won&#x27;t have much reason to unionize, and I think part of the reason unions are so rare in tech to this day is that many tech employees <i>are</i> satisfied. If a tech workplace unionizes I think that&#x27;s an obvious sign that the employees were unhappy enough to go through all the trouble of doing it, it&#x27;s not something they&#x27;d do on a whim.')
