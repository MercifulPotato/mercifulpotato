So for example, early precursors to the Krebs Cycle may have started within oceans, or perhaps some arrangement of pools and geysers or other geological features. So in essence, early life was bounded not in membranes, but within the flows of rock and air and heat of the atmosphere itself.<p>For more citable references to this stuff, this podcast episode from the Santa Fe Institute touches on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;complexity.simplecast.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;40" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;complexity.simplecast.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;40</a>')
