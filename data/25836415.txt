Intel lost because they made the wrong bet on the wrong <i>type</i> of process technology. 10 years ago (or thereabouts), Intel&#x27;s engineers were certain that they had the correct type of process technology outlined to successfully migrate down from 22nm to 14nm, then down to 10nm and eventually 7, 5, and 3nm. They were betting on future advances in physics, chemistry, and semiconductor processes. Advances that didn&#x27;t materialize.<p>EUV turned out to be the best way to make a wafer at lower transistor size.<p>So now Intel&#x27;s playing catch up. Their 10nm process is still error-prone and far from stable. There are no high-performance 10nm desktop or server chips.<p>That&#x27;s not going to continue forever though. Even on 14nm, Intel chips, while not as fast as Apple&#x27;s M1 or AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series, are still competitive in many areas. Intel&#x27;s 14nm chips are over 6 years old. The first was Broadwell in October 2014. What do you think will happen when Intel solves the engineering problems on 10nm, and then 7nm? And then 5nm?<p>It took AMD 5 years to become competitive with Intel, and over 5 to actually surpass them.<p>If you think the M1 and 5950X are fast, then wait till we have an i9-14900K on 5nm. It&#x27;ll make these offers look <i>quaint</i> by comparison.<p>EDIT: I say this as a total AMD fanboy by the way, who bought a 3900X and RX 5700 XT at MicroCenter on 7&#x2F;7&#x2F;2019 and stood in line for almost five hours to get them, and as someone who now has a Threadripper 3990X workstation. I love AMD for what they&#x27;ve done... they took us out of the quad-core paradigm and brought us into the octa-core paradigm of x86 computing.<p>But I am under <i>no</i> illusions that they&#x27;re technically superior to Intel. Their <i>process</i> is what allows them to outperform Intel, not their design. I guarantee you that if Intel could mass produce <i>their</i> CPUs on <i>their</i> 7nm process (which is far, far more transistor dense than TSMC&#x27;s 7nm), AMD would be 15-25% behind on performance.<p>It isn&#x27;t so much that AMD is succeeding because they&#x27;re technically superior... they&#x27;re succeeding because Zen&#x27;s design team made the right bet and because Intel&#x27;s engineering process team made the <i>wrong</i> bet.')
