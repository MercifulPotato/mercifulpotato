This site conflates algorithms, data, machine learning, math, and specific applications of any of these.<p>Math _is_ neutral.<p>Algorithms _are_ neutral, and are simply instruction sets for operating on data.<p>Data is certainly be biased, but any researcher, designer, engineer, etc. worth their salt will try to minimise the inherent bias.<p>Machine learning is basically brute-force statistics on data. Or alternatively, iterated application of an algorithm on data. In and of itself it is neutral. Any apparent bias in the results will almost completely be a result of bias in the data, _not_ the design of the algorithm.<p>All of these (except data) are tools. What we should be worrying about is the specific applications of these tools. Which, I agree, should be subject to some sort of ethical review before widespread use.<p>Stop trying to drag math and algorithms into this political quagmire, and instead focus on the actual problem. We don&#x27;t outlaw knives because they are still incredibly useful tools. We outlaw stabbing people.')
