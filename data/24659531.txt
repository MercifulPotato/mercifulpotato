We are looking to bring the startup ethos to the corporate world and get to combine the best of both worlds: ample funding, a huge customer base to deploy to and lots of freedom.<p>I&#x27;m the lead of the full stack team and we are building the services behind our products (mainly F#&#x2F;C# on GCP, but we always look for the right tool for the job).<p>You can learn more and apply here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valora.digital" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valora.digital</a> (bottom of the page).
