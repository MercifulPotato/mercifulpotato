It&#x27;s not even close to 16ms (1&#x2F;60), it&#x27;s ~118ms (7.1&#x2F;60).<p>It&#x27;s far cry from simplified pure math people think of when they think of fps in games or refresh rate for office and typing. Software is very very lazy lately, and most of the time these issues are being fixed by throwing more hardware at it, not fixing the code.')
