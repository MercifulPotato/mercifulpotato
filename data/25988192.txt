Could you maybe go into how creating a second company, Tesla-2, would have zero effects on the original Tesla&#x27;s future cash flows and stock price?<p>In my na√Øve view, TSLA&#x27;s future cash flows have value because the company is expected to sell a lot of cars that:<p>1. No one else makes (or practically no one, such that TSLA has a majority of market share)<p>2. Many people want to buy.<p>Now, supposing TSLA would be able to service all the demand for its cars, how would a competing TSLA-2, presumably offering identical cars (or of identical value at least) not affect TSLA&#x27;s future cash flows?<p>All things equal, if two companies sell products that are basically the same (same quality, price, etc), wouldn&#x27;t that split the market in two? I wouldn&#x27;t expect to see people buying twice as many cars because there are now two companies producing them.')
