I don&#x27;t know how but I got my hands on a copy of Redhat Linux on floppy and tried (and tried, and tried) to install it. This is back when they literally made you build the entire kernel from source code. I was running gcc with all these flags had no clue what I was doing. Finally got it installed, I remember the day when I finally built X windows it was so amazing! I started networking PC&#x27;s together in a LAN in my parents house.<p>We got a CD-ROM drive a few years later with Microsoft Encarta I remember it was like having the internet! Fast forward to BBS&#x27;s. AOL, Prolog,<p>I spent 10-15 years out of the industry completely and finally got back into &quot;tech&quot; and building websites, installing VOIP systems (figuring that out), implementing backup systems for doctors, making intranets for small businesses, everything in between. Now I run a development house. Can&#x27;t say the work I do is ground breaking, I tell people what I do is like the janitorial work of the internet: we do the work small businesses either don&#x27;t want to do or don&#x27;t know how to do. Not rich by any means but work for myself and make my own hours.')
