I think it used to get triggered on upload but says it needs a cronjob now. Works OK on a folder of 40GB of photos.<p>What I still find irritating about photos in nextcloud is I keep mine in high resolution but nextcloud won&#x27;t downscale them to fit the viewing device screen, so I use 20mb a photo with all the UX impairment one might imagine when actually a few kB would do. It&#x27;d be nice if it cached light, fullscreen versions and offered a &quot;view in full resolution&quot; button.')
