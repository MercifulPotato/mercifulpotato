Out of 150+ comments so far, I believe there has not been a single technical comment about the actual work involved in building a version-pinned RHEL clone.<p>Without any experience myself (beyond some kernel build maybe 10 years ago), I gathered (from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.centos.org&#x2F;About&#x2F;Building_8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.centos.org&#x2F;About&#x2F;Building_8</a>) that the majority  of work involves manually de-branding the RHEL sources. This apparently can&#x27;t be automated, as it requires human judgement in which packages&#x2F;files de-branding is required and in which it might actually break something.<p>Between major version jumps, e.g. from RHEL&#x2F;CentOS 7-&gt;8 there&#x27;s apparently also lots of work in getting the build environment up to date.<p>This raises numerous interesting questions, such as:<p>1. Where do the upstream RHEL sources live? CentOS sources are in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vault.centos.org&#x2F;8.3.2011&#x2F;BaseOS&#x2F;Source&#x2F;SPackages&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vault.centos.org&#x2F;8.3.2011&#x2F;BaseOS&#x2F;Source&#x2F;SPackages&#x2F;</a>, but where do they get them upstream? I believe they&#x27;re only available to RHEL subscribers, does this give RH a way to block clones?<p>2. Where &#x2F; what are CentOS&#x27;s actual build scripts &#x2F; tools? Is there some howto or writeup how to make a CentOS iso (or cloud-image) on my own PC after downloading the source tree?<p>3. Do CentOS devs go through the entire manual de-branding exercise with every minor&#x2F;major update? Presumably they are using <i>some</i> sort of automation&#x2F;scripting&#x2F;diffing somewhere. Are these processes&#x2F;tools available or documented anywhere?<p>I hope at some point someone with some actual knowledge about this can chime in.')
