Tesla’s showroom model breaks the benefits of that approach which makes competing at the very bottom of the market less appealing especially as their currently constrained by manufacturing capacity.<p>It’s different in China where a 250 mile 25k car would still be aspirational for many people.  Though the US market might look at a 200 mile range 25k EV with a 300 mile range option at ~30k as a slightly different story with significant upsell possibilities for Tesla.')
