They work by varying the thickness of the print to control the amount of light that passes through.  The result is a monochrome image you can see when held up to light and feel with your fingers.<p>In the video the gentleman, who seems to be a photographer specializing in very early photographic techniques, shares a story of how he got a 3d printer during the pandemic and created some lithopanes of his work.  He low key mentions you can buy them.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in lithopanes this video is at best a definition of the technique and demonstration of results.')
