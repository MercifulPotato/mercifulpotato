Changes:<p>- The bars are now ordered correctly based on votes<p>- Tooltip now shows comment.substring(0, 100)<p>- Show direct childs of the selected comment<p>- Added paddings and some small info notations<p>- New cached data for the default link (&gt; 3500 comments now, it would take a good 15 mins if loaded manually from your browser)<p>It is still a crappy code, and there are many improvements can be made. Most importantly a proper navigation behavior with back button. I&#x27;ll get back to this if I have more time!<p>The code is on my GitHub [1], feel free to send PR or just create your own page.<p>The old page is still available in [2] just in case someone don&#x27;t want&#x2F;agree with my improvements :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trungdq88&#x2F;hn-big-threads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trungdq88&#x2F;hn-big-threads</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trungdq88.github.io&#x2F;hn-big-threads&#x2F;old.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trungdq88.github.io&#x2F;hn-big-threads&#x2F;old.html</a><p>Thanks!')
