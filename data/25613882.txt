Remote causes are often complex and intertwined with a huge number of factors (think: the Fed raising the interest rate, and affecting the whole economy in one fell swoop); proximate causes are simpler to think about. And so it is usually more effective to focus on proximate causes, because any change in the macro-environment that will affect you will likely show up as a proximate cause first. The way I like to think about this is that remote causes are akin to the interactions of water molecules in a vapour cloud — you’ll have to spend a huge amount of analytical power to figure out if they’ll ultimately affect your windows. The effective person won’t bother with any of that; they would instead watch for the movement of water droplets on glass.&quot;<p>This goes somewhat against the grain with current-popular second-order thinking - when you try to take into account unintended consequences - but this article argues that it is more important to pay attention to immediate causes and environment, to solve the right problem.')
