People dream of being rich.<p>2. Unicorns represent Big Wins: an idea that was worth a huge sum of money. It makes the world a richer place, figuratively and literally. The person who had it (and more importantly, the people who run it) are Big Heroes.<p>Companies like Facebook and Uber aren&#x27;t just big companies. They change the world, making value from something that wasn&#x27;t valuable before. That may be a Good Thing or a Bad Thing, but it&#x27;s a Thing in a way that ten thousand smaller companies don&#x27;t.<p>As with celebrities, we probably talk about them disproportionately to the value -- in part because they give us something in common to talk about. But there&#x27;s usually some kind of &quot;there&quot; there, as well.')
