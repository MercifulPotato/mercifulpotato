Now you want answers to satisfy &quot;most philosophers&quot;.<p><i>&quot;You can ask a dozen physicists and they will all give you the same answer. Philosophy only tells you how to live if you ask exactly one philosopher. Ask a second, and you will be no better off than when you started.&quot;</i><p>Philosophy is not physics.  There is no consensus on many of the problems that concern it.<p>Philosophy, by the way, is far from the only academic discipline that lacks such a consensus.<p>Harry Truman said <i>&quot;If you laid every economist in the country end to end, they would all point in different directions.&quot;</i><p>There are also many disagreements on fundamental issues in psychology, and probably many if not most other &quot;soft sciences&quot;.<p>But philosophy is not a science, so why are you holding it up to scientific standards?<p>Art and music aren&#x27;t sciences either, but most people recognize they have tremendous value anyway.<p>By the way, I&#x27;ve noticed that you&#x27;re laser-focused on this consensus issue, while completely being unable to acknowledge that philosophy has value apart from the issue of whether it gives you answers that everyone can agree on.<p>How about philosophy&#x27;s value in training the mind?<p>Please answer if you find that valuable.<p>How about philosophy&#x27;s value in letting people question their own assumptions?<p>Do you find that valuable?<p>Or philosophy&#x27;s value in letting you see things from a different perspective?<p>Can you specifically address these points instead of endlessly returning to the one point of philosophy not having answers that everyone can agree on?')
