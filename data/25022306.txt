Democrats, for example, are much more likely than Republicans to favor banning assault-style weapons (88% vs. 50%) and high-capacity magazines (87% vs. 54%).”<p>You can also see in the charts in that link that even though a modest majority of all Americans believes there should be stricter gun laws, it is driven drastically by how dominant that view is among Democrats (86%) vs Republicans (where 69% say current gun laws are OK or are already too strict).<p>I only chose this topic because it refutes the falsehood that there’s some core of reasonable centrists in America - there’s totally not. Many issues are like this example of gun laws where it is extremely partisan and where one version of the extreme partisan divide is usually considered “centrist” (for example, belief that gun laws are mostly OK as-is, which is a really right wing belief but is seen as “centrist”) but it actually belies America being heavily shifted to the far right by default, so it’s not really center.')
