If we&#x27;re just sending machines and infrastructure into the mantle, maybe that&#x27;s possible.  If we want to send people it&#x27;s harder.  I don&#x27;t know if anything like the oxygenated fluid from the Abyss (or the LCL from Evangelion which was more or less the same thing) does or can exist in reality.  Or if other problems would arise at extreme pressures.<p>Your mention of high melting point materials makes me wonder if fiber optic cables could be made that survive in that environment.  It&#x27;d be an expensive undertaking just to reduce, say, the network latency from North America to Asia.<p>If we ignore the mantle, building into the shallow crust where it&#x27;s still cool seems like a reasonable thing to do.  I suspect the main reason it&#x27;s usually not done are the cost of earth removal and reinforcement being higher than above-ground structures, and having to deal with water.  It&#x27;s fun to think about what an underground megastructure would be like, though.  Could be as simple as turning an old pit mine or quarry into a below-ground urban center.<p>In Portland, OR out towards Gresham there&#x27;s a huge hole in the ground next to the Multnomah County land use planning department that I suppose is probably an old quarry.  I like to imagine what it&#x27;d look like with apartment complexes along the sides and a park with a lake at the bottom.  Maybe a shopping center with a farmer&#x27;s market, and a light rail stop.  Keeping it from flooding would be a huge logistical challenge, though.')
