The setup process is Enter Server Address + Port -&gt; Enter username -&gt; Connect, and you&#x27;re done. For someone who has ever used an installation wizard before, it is not difficult. For very casual users -- I agree, it probably can be overwhelming.<p>I don&#x27;t argue that Mumble is somehow as easy or easier than Discord. Discord has everything else beat when it comes to ease-of-use.<p>Also, in my opinion, Mumble&#x27;s UI looks fine, and I appreciate that it looks native on whatever platform you run it on (as opposed to Electron apps like Discord). I also appreciate the lower RAM usage and system requirements in general.')
