I’m running the IT department for a medium sized bank, and we are about to migrate a 70.000 programs and 1.200 tables from COBOL DB2 on mainframe - first to emulators for a few years,but a selective rewrite is in the air as well.<p>The thing I’m struggling to decide which tech stack to use - everyone has an opinion, but few people truly grasp the stress on reliability, maintenance, cost efficiency and long term support of the system holding all of your lifetime savings. Consultants telling me to write the beast in all sort of fancy languages, many which I consider a Fad which likely won’t exist in 10-15 years (minimum lifespan of rewrite)<p>So I wanted to pick HNs collective brain for suggestions on languages to pick. I was considering C, which we know well but is delicate to maintain (as in not every junior consultant can dangle well in it), or RUST (which I admit I don’t know but heard good things about)<p>Some additional info: We would be aiming at a functional rewrite, mostly service based. Front ends would be decoupled and served via APIs. Data layer will be abstracted to enable to shift CPUs loads in the future. Not a big fan of containers for this (but we do use them to scale our front end architecture)<p>Any ideas are welcomed. It’s a multi-hundred million investment and getting honest advice from someone not with a personal power play is hard. And rest assured this won’t be my only research, it’s just a soundness test<p>Many thanks\nf.')
