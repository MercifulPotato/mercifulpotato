Couldn&#x27;t you make the front of the missile more buoyant than the rest, so once you pop it out of the sub it self-rights and likewise pops out of the water?<p>That would make the entire thing more complicated with more chances of failure because now the SLBM wobbles around when it tries to right itself up (on a non-aerodynamic axis so more chance it&#x27;ll move wrong), you need much bigger openings for the missiles, and your gain will be limited: remember, they&#x27;re 2m wide so if you stack them by 4 you still need 9m for the missiles alone except now you also need to have 3 rows of missiles meaning you need a lot of extra horizontal space (in the current configuration the missile compartment of an Ohio is about 40m, it&#x27;d need to be 60+). It also makes the launch procedure take longer, as the missile can&#x27;t accelerate as fast out of its casing: it doesn&#x27;t just pop straight up like a cork anymore.')
