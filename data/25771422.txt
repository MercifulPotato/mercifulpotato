But a couple of years ago I moved to film photography, I have a small camera for day-to-day and medium format for other stuff.<p>I keep all the negatives as a physical backup and all the scans go straight into google photos. The special ones are printed and in a photo book.<p>Pros are no longer being plagued with thousands of photos, I am a lot more purposeful with my photography, as scanning technology improves I can rescan for higher quality photos. Also I am more creative with film, it has made me learn a lot more about photography.<p>Cons are low light photography is harder, development&#x2F;scanning is costly if you aren&#x27;t doing it yourself and if you are it costs time.')
