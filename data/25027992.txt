That ship sailed. Even the biggest enterprises seem pretty happy to use cloud solutions for most things. I agree backup (and off ramps) are critical in any cloud offering. Can’t be in lock-in and also can’t trust their backup only of course.<p>Jira to me is just an issue manager though. I know there are plugins these days for document management inside Jira itself but I haven’t tried them. Don’t people normally have separate document solutions like Confluence or SharePoint for docs (aside from document that are attached to issues of course)?')
