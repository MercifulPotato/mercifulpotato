Assuming that for the most part like items are clumped together it doesn&#x27;t matter if you can remember if Lay&#x27;s southern barbecue was in stock it matters if, when strolling down the aisle, you were able to see the majority of the chips in one place.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like sequential read vs random read. In a physical store it&#x27;s largely possible to sequentially read the inventory even if you can&#x27;t quickly search for individual items randomly quickly. On Amazon you&#x27;re not going to go through all of the aisles sequentially, at best you go in knowing exactly what virtual aisles you want and then you can sequentially search that and even then the best it&#x27;s going to work out is the worst case of walking through the entire store for an hour.')
