These are two entirely different issues.<p>If you can avoid both at the same time, terrific! If you can only avoid one, avoid the germs. They will kill you faster.<p>(Ideally, you also work at reducing&#x2F;limiting how much exposure you have to the thing poisoning you. Edit: One possible solution here is to drink your coffee cold, such as frappuccino drinks. Even in the same cup, it should be far less of an issue.)')
