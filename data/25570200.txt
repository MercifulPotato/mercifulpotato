Fuel-air explosives operate in this manner.  But they are devices with countless engineering man-hours spent making them actually work and fairly precise manufacturing.  \nParking ye ol&#x27; Winnebago (or Penske, if you&#x27;re a history buff) beside the tracks and waiting for the train to go by is not going to be a very productive approach.  Look at people blowing up propane tanks on YouTube.  At best they get a fireball.<p>I&#x27;d much rather have nat-gas wafting up and away rather than crude oil, propane, or some other volatile that sits at ground level.')
