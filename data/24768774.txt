New system from the scratch in the same technology would be very cheap (given there are folks around who still know original language&#x2F;platform).<p>System being completely rewritten - I can&#x27;t agree on that one either. Some, in some companies do, most don&#x27;t. I personally manage quite a few of those and there isn&#x27;t budget for costly migration experiments if things work. Working in one of the biggest global banks in Switzerland. What works is if ie OS&#x2F;browser that is absolutely required isn&#x27;t supported anymore and there is no way around it.<p>There are very few cases where the approach &#x27;if it isn&#x27;t broken don&#x27;t fix it&#x27; isn&#x27;t the best approach for the company. But good luck trying to explain it to devs&#x2F;teams who want to try new things (basically at the cost of employer, I don&#x27;t blame them but it is what it is).')
