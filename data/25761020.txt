This mean nothing beyond a trip to the hardware or variety store. I&#x27;m sure if someone were determined enough this could be made with things like cardboard, junk plastic strips, scrap metal, duck tape, wire ties and a little ingenuity. Sure it might not be as nice but it WILL be cheap and simple.')
