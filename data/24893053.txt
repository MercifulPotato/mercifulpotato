That&#x27;s quite the tome. I have a deep suspicion that like Joyce or Wallace, this is a book for people who really like <i>books</i>. You know, as a concept, taken as a whole. There seems to universal agreement that this is one the &quot;best&quot; or &quot;first&quot; or &quot;most&quot; or &quot;greatest&quot; or some other superlative without actually having any specific reason or agreement as to why. That&#x27;s always a good hint.')
