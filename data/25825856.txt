It requires honesty, transparency, strong leadership (ruthless prioritization), strong cross-team goodwill, strong cross-team collaboration as well as a solid body of experienced top-tier engineers. Other than that there&#x27;s no magic.  While there are teams within apple that does scrum&#x2F;agile, none of the core OS&#x2F;frameworks teams does it AFAIK, and I do think it&#x27;s incompatible with shipping on a hardware-aligned schedule.')
