Because of strong wishful thinking? Or because of vaccines?<p>See, that&#x27;s the thing that enrages me. Here we have an &quot;epidemic&quot; (it&#x27;s not) that was caused 11 cases of polio - after the virus was eradicated on the continent with the help of the vaccine. An outbreak that wouldn&#x27;t even be a blip on radar if not for vaccines.<p>For heaven&#x27;s sake.')
