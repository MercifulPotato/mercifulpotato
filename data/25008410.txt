At one point, you fled the city to a farm, you are looking for food - would you kill the owners to take over the farm? Would you be able to? If you killed them, would you know how to milk a cow? How to run an actual farm? If you look at the barn, there will be machines that need electric power and gas, what do you do if you run out of gas? Does the farm still have old equipment from the 19th century that doesn&#x27;t need gas? Does the farm still have animals to pull that euqipment? Do you know how to sow? When to sow? Where to get seeds? Even if you managed to do all that, at one point other people will come by, who might also try to take over the farm, or even just steal from you. Would you be able to defend yourself?<p>As a viewer, you quickly get the impression that you would most likely be dead after 2-3 months.')
