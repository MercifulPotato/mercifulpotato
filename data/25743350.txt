We&#x27;re a YC-backed startup university based in San Francisco.\nI&#x27;m currently leading an R&amp;D initiative to bring more of our content to an online friendly format as we gear up to launch an online Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Applied Computer Science. We&#x27;re aiming to hit a content quality on par with Vox &#x2F; Masterclass paired with exercises and projects.<p>Our eventual goal is to properly unbundle a university degree into a more modular and modern education format that aligns with how students and professionals learn today. Instead of traditional classrooms, students will go through self-paced high quality videos paired with active learning exercises and projects and significant 1:1 and small group instructor support.<p>I&#x27;m looking to work with a curriculum engineer to help port and further develop our existing CS curriculum into an online first, modular experience. Our R&amp;D team will be full remote, so you can be anywhere in the world.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, you can see more details and apply here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;makeschool&#x2F;bf0b47ad-3d75-4969-958b-04d91a8d3096" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;makeschool&#x2F;bf0b47ad-3d75-4969-958b-04d...</a>')
