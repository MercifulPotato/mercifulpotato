Some people would demand that I give them access to private messages of their &quot;partners&quot; and would threaten me that they will find me and &quot;sort me out&quot;. Sometimes I had technical issues where the server would go down for a couple of hours - so there was a profile of a local band, something like a Facebook pages are now, and they made a post about the concert they are going to have, but the server was down on that day and they blamed me they lost money because just a few people came to the concert. I also had someone claiming to be a partner of one of the users demanding that I delete his partner account as she ignores him and only spends time on the website and sent me my home address. Very stressful.<p>edit: I remember one more. One guy would post his nude pictures typically exposing his face and his bottom and then he would write his name and address and add messages like &quot;beat this guy up&quot;, &quot;come find me&quot; he would register other accounts and then post degrading comments under these pictures of himself. I initially thought that this is some kind of revenge and I was promptly deleting this and removing these accounts. Eventually that person would write that this is turning them on and was very upset that it gets deleted. It&#x27;s when I added IP blocking and blocked all addresses he used.')
