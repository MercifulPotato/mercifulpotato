So many people don&#x27;t take the 10 minutes to configure DMARC, DKIM and SPF.  I&#x27;ve been hosting my own domains since 1996 and I haven&#x27;t ever had a problem with any of them sending mail to any of the big hosters.  If your DMARC passes and you actually have a policy set to REJECT you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to not have a problem as long as your domain isn&#x27;t a few days old.  The first thing I do for any new domain I plan to use is get all of those items configured ASAP and start sending mail into Google and O365 to test and thereby end up in their domain analysis.<p>Given all the horror stories I&#x27;ve moved all but one domain off of Gmail (mainly to preserve my grandfathered G-Suite.

Bring email back from the monopolized &quot;free&quot; tier!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailarchiva.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailarchiva.com&#x2F;</a>')
