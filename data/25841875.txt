(what&#x27;s a &#x27;finite group action?&#x27; The &#x27;group&#x27; is a set of composable and reversible &quot;moves.&quot; The &#x27;action&#x27; means that the group moves are effectively state transitions acting on a set of states, and that the action is nice and associative: g<i>(h</i>s) = (g<i>h)</i>s. And &#x27;finite&#x27; just says that there&#x27;s only so many states possible...)<p>Really nice demo, by the way! Very fun to see the squares go flying.')
