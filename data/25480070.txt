America benefits greatly from mass murder &amp; destruction of countries who are insufficiently deferential to the hegemony. Countries can&#x27;t keep natural resources to themselves; American corporations must be let in to siphon wealth back to the imperial core. Don&#x27;t like it? Enjoy having your economy destroyed &amp; government overthrown. With a few generations&#x27; worth of atrocities just for good measure.')
