Tesla battery farm) or are heavily subsidized to make renewables appear viable.  You are also making some large assumptions regarding battery improvements that may turn out to never be realized -- there may be interesting new chemistries and techniques that work for smaller scale but are infeasible for one reason or another at large scale.  It is also possible that the opposite is true (e.g. like for fuel cells) where bigger is better in terms of efficiency and production costs, but so far I have no seen any indication of this.')
