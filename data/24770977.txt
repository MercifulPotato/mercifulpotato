Item(by='CamperBob2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602627628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770120, text='Archive.org is so weird.  Henry Ford died in 1947, so <i>Moving Forward</i> is out of copyright (and consequently available on Project Gutenberg, as another post points out).  Yet on archive.org I can only &quot;borrow&quot; an encrypted copy.<p>Meanwhile, <i>Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy</i> was published in 1970 by Wayne R. Moore, who was presumably still alive at the time, so its copyright status is still very much in force... but archive.org says &quot;Here, have a nicely-OCR&#x27;ed .PDF.&quot;<p>I hope they&#x27;re able to survive their present legal difficulties, but I&#x27;ll be darned if I can see how.')
