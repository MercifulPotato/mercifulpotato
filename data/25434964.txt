This shit happens with literally all of our single-use disposable garbage. Any system that requires billions of individual people to follow rules that inconvenience them without any sort of enforcement or consequences that come back to them personally was doomed to fail from the start.<p>If we had just distributed reusable cloth masks and charged for them so people have an incentive to not lose them we could have avoided the bulk of this.')
