It&#x27;s in their cynical self-interest to spend the money to have the best documentation in the game, and it would even pay off inside Apple, with better APIs and better resources for their in-house teams to develop against.<p>It seems like a genuine institutional dysfunction. Apple has a culture of secrecy (which is necessary) and a result of this is deep siloing of teams. How this leads to documentation being such an afterthought is murky, but I suspect that&#x27;s the cause, rather than merely being complacent about their walled garden.')
