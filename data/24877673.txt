We&#x27;ve yet to see widespread adoption in commercial and professional applications - that&#x27;s coming, but I am surprised why IP for bluetooth&#x2F;wifi is so expensive outside of Chinese chip makers? ST, NXP, Microchip, Renesas, etc. have really expensive SoCs - $15&#x2F;chip and over. These giants seem to be sleeping. What&#x27;s preventing them from competing with the Chinese?<p>Also, we have horrendous price gouging for memory. A mere 128k to 256k bump in memory spec on a microcontroller will send you back a $1.20 in chip price.<p>Is there some CCP-gov subsidy going on to capture the market? Espressif&#x27;s ESP32 is such an extraordinary chip with 500kb+ memory and yet, it is an order of magnitude cheaper than anything close from western suppliers. What gives?')
