Of course the official language is English, and all documents should be written in English and emails should be in English and so on.\nEven if everybody (down to the Janitor?) speak acceptable English and are perfectly able to talk business in English... everyone will still use German unless they have to communicate with someone like me, whose German fluency is rated in Imaginary Numbers.')
