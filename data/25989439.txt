Two different entities.<p>2) Hand waves away settlement issues altogether (never mentioning the DTCC), when they are the heart of the issue. If Robinhood has to post large amounts of collateral for every GME purchase (and sales reduce the collateral requirements), doesn’t that directly explain their behavior? No conspiracy needed?<p>So little actual insight in a blog reporting to do a “deep dive” into the situation.')
