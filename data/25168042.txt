You&#x27;re not likely to even notice a single event. For example it could be any bit of a single pixel on the screen. Or one letter in all the text displayed over a month. Even if it happened in the code, you&#x27;d have to hit some function in the kernel which has any impact at all, instead of for example sending a bad packet.')
