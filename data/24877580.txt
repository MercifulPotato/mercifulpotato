All organizations ideally have a goal. Vision. Mission, whatever you choose to call it. People at the top decide on that goal, and they decide on a strategy that might let them reach their goal.<p>That strategy should start by considering the things that cannot be changed (legislation like GDPR, maybe scalability, availability of resource, or health and safety regulations).<p>The leaders would then consider mutable factors, things they DO control like number of employees, technology options, business model, geographic location.<p>These two broad things (immutable and mutable factors) will lead to a list of things that need doing to achieve world domination. Sorry, I mean success.<p>That list of tasks is handed off to employees who will repeat a similar process within their areas at a more granular level.<p>Good reporting up and down the chain allows people at all levels of the organization to adjust course  when needed, with a level of autonomy suited to whatever level you&#x27;re in within the organization.<p>If the organisation is small enough people at the bottom may will seek out people at the top for direction.<p>No cult required.')
