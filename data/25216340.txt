So the &quot;taxes&quot; will come in the form of reduced value of money, or taxes in the future. Level of taxation is pretty much equivalent to the level of government spending. There&#x27;s, no way around it.<p>On top of that, general population&#x27;s savings are being depleted. So yeah, future is bleak. Anyway, I hope the gov spending will get to sane levels soon.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that this is the global phenomenon, so economy&#x2F;currency is not crashing as much compared to the surrounding countries. But there are still wild swings of ~10% or so compared to USD or EUR.')
