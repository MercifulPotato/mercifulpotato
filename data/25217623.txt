We were talking about Maradona a few weeks back.<p>I thought when talking about him that if he showed up in London, there would be a mob around him, but it would be 50% people wanting his signature and selfies, and the other 50% would want to give him a piece of their mind about the Hand of God goal.<p>He probably wouldn&#x27;t have been safe in London. As a Man City supporter, I know my estimation of Aguero was dinted a little when I found out he was Maradona&#x27;s son-in-law.<p>Why? I remember that handball goal (it was not &quot;the hand of god&quot;, it was deliberate handball), as being the moment in my childhood that I realised I could not trust some adults. Some adults - it became clear to me then - were dishonest. Even if they were brilliant, talented and otherwise seemingly worthy of respect, they were capable of cheating and not caring. To a young child (I was approaching my 8th birthday at the time), that was shocking to the core, and I cried, not just at England losing the game but that he - and an entire team, an entire country of adults - had cheated and felt fine with it.<p>Part of my childhood ended with that goal. I know I&#x27;m not alone.<p>I would have been in the group wanting a selfie though.')
