Depending on what type of game it is. If it just has to compute &quot;so many resources per second produced&quot; it&#x27;s easy of course and you can use the delta between last tick (if Date.now() works correctly), but if the game can auto-build various things with complex interactions, it can become computationally complex if it has to do all at once.')
