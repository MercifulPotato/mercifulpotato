Cellebrite makes products that can, in some cases, unlock phones. Signal Messenger depends on the phone OS to protect the key used to encrypt the saved data. So in some cases Cellebrite does have the power to break the saved data encryption.<p>The Signal case is interesting because the app used to have a feature where you could protect the data with a separate strong passphrase. That would of prevented this particular attack. For reasons that are not clear to me, Signal eliminated this feature.')
