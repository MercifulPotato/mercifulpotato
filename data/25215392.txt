Yes, a large majority of the wealthy people did get there by working hard, and being disciplined with money.<p>That depends on how you define &#x27;wealthy.&#x27; There is a vast gulf between the kind of money people of sound mind and body can get through hard work and the degree of wealth the truly rich actually own.<p>The guy who grew up in a ghetto but is now making a six figure income (anywhere but San Francisco) did it mostly though his own hard work. I would not, however, call that guy wealthy when compared to the truly rich.<p>The 40 people who own more wealth than the bottom 50% of the US population own it by virtue of being born to the right parents. There is no degree of hard work that will make someone a billionaire. Those people got that far by being born into a family that could give them seed capital and access to elite education that enmeshes them into the right social networks.<p>When people talk about income inequality, they&#x27;re not talking about people earning $500,000 in wage income by working 80 hour weeks. Instead, they&#x27;re talking about people who are extracting a tens of millions of dollars in  economic rents (as largely untaxed capital gains) without needing to do any work for it.')
