The natural argument here is that those things are required to motivate the player to make their automation faster and more efficient to progress the game, but the point is that they <i>feel</i> needlessly arbitrary. In a game like Subnautica, for instance, there are some big high-resource things you have to build with reasonably deep critical paths, but they are things you actually use instead of just melting them down to increase a number somewhere. They feel necessary, science-slurry doesn&#x27;t.<p>Players also claim that yeah, that&#x27;s all true, but the <i>real</i> game doesn&#x27;t start until after you&#x27;ve researched everything and launched your first rocket anyway. Meaning all of that is essentially a 40 hour <i>tutorial</i>.')
