In the past it was 1 USD to Bitcoin exchange, and then 1 major altcoin exchange. Both of them would either routinely become less convenient, or completely implode and be inaccessible. Now it&#x27;s been years since I had to change them.<p>When exchanges implode now, it is no longer international news, and the criticism is placed on the poorly run business. It was always poorly run businesses. Imagine blaming the Marriott hack on computers and saying computers aren&#x27;t regulated enough. That&#x27;s pretty much what people were doing with bitcoin for 10 years straight, it was comical to watch people grasp at things they didn&#x27;t understand to agree with their pre-existing opinions.<p>Those things are major improvement for confidence. Some people need that.')
