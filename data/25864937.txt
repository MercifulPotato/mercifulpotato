It was rejected because &quot;Parler...proffered only faint and factually inaccurate speculation in support of a Sherman Act violation. AWS, in contrast...submitted sworn testimony disputing Parlerâ€™s allegations.&quot; That said, Parler &quot;has not yet had an opportunity to conduct discovery,&quot; so maybe there&#x27;s a bombshell text somewhere.')
