Anything less is dogma. Trying to appeal to &quot;the science&quot; in fact requires you to choose someone to interpret the science and pick and choose what theories are valid. Usually the media does this when they write clickbait articles, taking science out of context, or taking the most extreme interpretation as reality.')
