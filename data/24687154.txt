Ricardo simply provided the justification. As I said, that kind of economics is simply ideology at the service of the ruling class, with linear regression. Or in Retardo&#x27;s day; without linear regression.<p>FWIIW Retardo&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t work, by his own admission, where there is free flow of capital. It also doesn&#x27;t work when you can&#x27;t easily move resources to other ventures; something trivially obvious to all but the most fanatical of ideologues looking at, say, the industrial midwest of the US -Gary Indiana if you need a specific example. It also is a statement about national wealth, which means very little if all the benefits accrue to, say, 1-2 people (aka the Waltons or Oligarch Bezos, if you need specific examples). It also assumes technological development doesn&#x27;t exist (otherwise you should invest in protectionism and technology to make your production more efficient; duh). Oh yeah, and mathematically the examples don&#x27;t work with 3 of anything.<p>Must be real easy not having to deal with any thinkers because you disagree with their politics. I wonder how you get away with using Reed-Solomon codes or Kolomogorov anything: invented by commies.')
