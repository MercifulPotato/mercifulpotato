The options are either to have ADHD, which is a potentially very destructive disease, or to have a low-grade dependency on stimulants with few side-effects that can be severed in a week or two.<p>Of course, many medications that aren&#x27;t psychotropic fit the bill. Corticosteroids, for a common example, lead to physical dependency too. Most medications lead to some kind of physical dependency after prolonged use, it&#x27;s just sometimes of very low grade.<p>The second option is much better from any pathological point of view.<p>To note, perfect health doesn&#x27;t exist. We&#x27;re all broken in some way :)')
