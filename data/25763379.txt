Then this reply can also be judged for its value.<p>I understand some people are tired of hearing the same old argument, or a wrong fact, and so they downvote without response. But consider that you&#x27;re doing the moderation for others, not yourself. If you&#x27;re tired of explaining the problem (even in the obvious cases, with one word), then perhaps do not get involved at all in negative moderation.<p>Of course, the things that are obviously spam or offtopic should be deleted, not just downvoted, and that should be a different mechanism.')
