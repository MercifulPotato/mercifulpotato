We are talking about Apple, which is blocking Microsoft&#x27;s xCloud and Google&#x27;s Stadia on iOS on the grounds that Microsoft and Google are not submitting each individual game for review. Both xCloud and Stadia are just glorified video players, where you are streaming video of a game being played in a server room and sending back controls. If streaming video game video can be subject for individual approval on iOS, I don&#x27;t see streaming TV shows being subject to individual review that far off.')
