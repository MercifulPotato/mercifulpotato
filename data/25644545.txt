They have privately-owned companies, which is directly antithetical to the definition of Socialism as it&#x27;s been understood since the 19th Century. You might as well insist America was Socialist during the New Deal.<p>&gt; “welfare state capitalism,”<p>Historically, the welfare state was invented by Otto von Bismarck specifically to counter Socialism:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Otto_von_Bismarck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Otto_von_Bismarck</a><p>&gt; A master of complex politics at home, Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist opponents.<p>This seems to define Socialism as per the old joke: &quot;Socialism is when the government does stuff. The more the government does, the Socialister it is.&quot; That&#x27;s a really neat way to insist you can have Socialism without having to solve any of the problems Socialism ran into in the previous century.')
