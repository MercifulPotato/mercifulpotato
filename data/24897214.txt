Like the progression I did to get an engineering BS was roughly<p>* basic math &gt; algebra&#x2F;trig &gt; calculus, linear algebra, differential equations<p>As a non-mathematician, my impression has been that mathematicians do a lot of proof-based work since (to my impression) the goal is to make new findings, not just learn concepts and formulas that they can apply to their work like an engineer. From my limited experience with proof-based work, it seems like something where you would need guidance and discussion. Whereas when I learned things like derivatives and integrals, it was very procedural and you just needed to learn a process, which is then built on by a more advanced process, etc.<p>Can one realistically self-learn up to low-dimensional topology or algebraic geometry just by reading books and doing the exercises?')
