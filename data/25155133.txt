How much software would I have to rewrite to make this possible?  What value does that rewrite create?  And will maintenance programmers thank me for it?  Will it get adopted?<p>As a programmer I have to interact with databases, operating systems, various libraries in various languages, and so on.  Frequently with quick switching between them.  ALL are written assuming UTC.  Shall I name myself Don Quixote and spend the rest of my life on a rewrite that nobody wants to us?<p>Just to give a sense, I recently had to do some data science tasks.  Data was in Postgres, my code was in Python, using pandas for speed, and pandas is built on numpy.  All four of those have their own datetime library, and I had to deal with all four of them.  If I followed your suggestion, before I did any work I&#x27;d have to rewrite all 4 libraries, and then figure out how to replace Amazon RDS because it doesn&#x27;t support my &quot;improved Postgres&quot;.<p>And if I did all of that, I&#x27;ve not changed the odds of something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;leap-second-glitch-explained&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;leap-second-glitch-explained&#x2F;</a> happening again and taking down my favorite websites for a while.  Because guess what, they won&#x27;t be running my super-duper rewritten code.')
