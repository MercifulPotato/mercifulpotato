(depending on how much exposed innards you are comfortable with). They last longer when other family members are not using them but even my exclusive, careful use of one that only sits by my bed has pulled itself apart.<p>The article is a bit of a strawman but I think it&#x27;s inexcusable to be charging nearly twice the price of the charger for a 2m cable that disintegrates after a year or two. Especially when - as you say - they&#x27;ve changed the one in the box backwards-incompatibly (and it&#x27;s 1m too).')
