Or parens? Both!<p>I know you like Smalltalk, but keywords and parens are used together in a lot of languages (e.g. Python) so it&#x27;s a tested idea.<p>&gt; And the weird case of having two keywords, one with a colon and one without, because we decided to make the keywords the names of the parameters. Sometimes.<p>You don&#x27;t have two keywords, you have an optional variable name. It&#x27;s intuitive at the first time you see it - you&#x27;re phrasing makes it seem much more complex than it really is.<p>I think you&#x27;re trying to imply that Swift isn&#x27;t an elegant language with it&#x27;s syntax fitting in a postcard, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &#x27;tremendous complexity&#x27;. This whole comment is a bit too harsh to Swift, calling the legitimate differences between Swift and Smalltalk as &#x27;complexity&#x27;.')
