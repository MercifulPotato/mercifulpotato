I haven&#x27;t been running a high end gpu for several years now. The last one I had was an 8800GT. When I got that gpu I felt like I had &quot;made it&quot; in terms of being able to afford the hardware I always wanted as a child. Now with all this news about new gpus I decided to look on ebay for a mid-range AMD chip from the previous generation. Still going for Â£200-300! I can&#x27;t justify spending that much on games. Honestly are gamers just expected to have no other hobbies any more?')
