I came back a few months ago, having been away for quite a while. It was noticeably different even then. At that time, it was all about the US political situation. It&#x27;s not necessarily that the focus has become more political — although it undoubtedly has — it&#x27;s more that the comments are skewing more towards memes and triviality. Sad to see; let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s just a phase.')
