Was going to do a little DIY job at home and went to go price out some wood and dry wall. Just about had a heart attack when I saw 2x4&#x27;s were now $6 a pop!!<p>I know this has been a double edge sword since demand is sky high but a lot of the supply side suppliers are relying on China and they&#x27;ve all but stopped shipping a LOT of stuff from a myriad of regions. So yeah, demand is high but I&#x27;ve also heard the supply side issues with China are compounding the issue.<p>Are you seeing&#x2F;having any issues on the supply side yet?')
