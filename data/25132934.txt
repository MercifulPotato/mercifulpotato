This is how I used OmniFocus for a very long time (I use Things now but basically the same way I used OF). I also found the same dynamic: a lot of things went in, not a lot of things came out, and the things that did were incredibly helpful and usually focused around some very unambiguous context, like the grocery store or my boss or a doctor.<p>Everything else mostly became soup, and while Iâ€™d make lists to manage somethings, I handled most things intuitively and used Projects as reminders to think about something.
