What will be an acceptable %? Who decides that? What&#x27;s the framework for deciding that?<p>The framework is called competition. If Apple&#x27;s IAP billing or the whole app store in general faced any competition on iOS they wouldn&#x27;t be able to charge anywhere close to 30%.<p>But Apple designed their platform specifically to prevent that, to retain a tight grip over app distribution and billing.<p>&gt; I see one solution, and it&#x27;s far fetched, developers&#x2F;companies should fund and push for an alternative open platform, along with phone&#x2F;device makers.<p>Good solution, but we won&#x27;t get to it. The moat of Apple-Google mobile duopoly is way too massive to overcome naturally at this point. We need <i>some</i> regulation to reign this in. Mobile computing is just as essential as telephony and internet access. We can&#x27;t have two companies dictating the rules of the game for the whole economy.')
