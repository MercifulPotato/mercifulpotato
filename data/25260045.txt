It&#x27;s negligent to imply that this means that they are or would be negative.<p>Furthermore, even the original data point seems not literally true - this is based on net new cases, which would exclude people who became a net new case 15 or more days ago but actually <i>have</i> received a positive test recently because they are, for example, in the hospital right now and have gotten a repeated test that shows that they are still positive.<p>I would argue that making factually true statements for which the obvious implication actually is not true is inappropriate - and if it&#x27;s not by mistake (as it seems out of your other comments) then it&#x27;s intentionally misleading and <i>should</i> be downvoted.')
