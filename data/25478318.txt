I am not a resident of EU or California, you might be surprised at the vast number of websites which tell you to go pound sand if you try and delete your account. As a user, you can do nothing but hope someone deletes something for you if they feel like it; not all shop owners bother to respond as well, adding another layer of consternation.<p>&gt; But you seem to make it a bigger deal than it is.<p>You seem to lack empathy for how other people are sensitive to their PII (which in this case may and does include credit card purchase information, shipping addresses and other &quot;I really don&#x27;t want this floating around more than I need it to be&quot; information about my life) being retained by Shopify based stores.<p>The GDPR you keep leaning on to support your reply means nothing to a vast majority of the world and many sites happily only perform the minimum required actions required by law for those to whom it does apply.')
