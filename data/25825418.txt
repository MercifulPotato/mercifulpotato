This puts vendors and subordinate-to-revenue-generation IT departments in a bad situation if a customer forgets their password and suddenly loses years&#x27; worth of family photos, small-business tax documents, etc.<p>&gt; Our phones storage is uniformly encrypted by default now and have been for several years.<p>Only because phone storage is basically unimportant - most people sync everything (either of their own volition or via OS provider or via apps) from their phone to multiple cloud services and then the benefits of encryption-at-rest are honestly only their to protect and enforce the local app store and payment apps.')
