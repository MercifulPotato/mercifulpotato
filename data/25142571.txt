Netflix convinced a bunch of investors they were a tech company several years ago, got the tech money and valuation, and are now transferring it by the droves to content producers because it really is not a tech company and will not sustain tech company margins unless they can stay on top of any other challengers in the space like Disney, HBO, Prime Video, Hulu and whoever else wants to show up.  Is this actually sustainable?  What will differentiate them long term from other media conglomerates?  Of the other players in that space, Amazon is the most interesting because of the sheer breadth of their entire business.')
