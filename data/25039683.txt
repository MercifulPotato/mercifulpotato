I&#x27;d believe that Go would require a few less servers than, say, async Python but the title really should have been something like “A little architecture goes a long way”. The approach they described is no doubt considerably more polished but people built websites using the same techniques back in the 90s to avoid SPOFs and then XHR made that even easier to do robustly.<p>To be clear: this isn&#x27;t to say that their work wasn&#x27;t good but really seconding the point they&#x27;re making about how the original design was the wrong architecture for a public website and there&#x27;s no easy way to band-aid around that.')
