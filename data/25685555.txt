As an advocacy group, the SPLC is a biased and opinionated source. The organization&#x27;s views, especially when labeling hate groups, should be attributed per WP:RSOPINION. Take care to ensure that content from the SPLC constitutes due weight in the article and conforms to the biographies of living persons policy. Some editors have questioned the reliability of the SPLC on non-United States topics. SPLC classifications should not automatically be included in the lead section of the article about the group which received the classification. The decision to include should rather be decided on a case-by-case basis.<p>Does &quot;biased and opinionated source&quot; not sufficiently reflect your views?')
