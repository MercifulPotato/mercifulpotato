There have been so many stories about it hitting 100&#x27;000, 50&#x27;000, even 500&#x27;000, that these current prices seem &quot;low&quot; in comparison. i.e. the voluminous news stories hyping up the price have psychologically anchored a high value bitcoin in many investor&#x27;s minds.<p>Also, there is a major, major element of FOMO happening here. People are home, isolated, bored, reading more news, and reading of &quot;Bitcoin Millionaires&quot; etc, and of course, they want in on that action too. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to what&#x27;s happening with Tesla.')
