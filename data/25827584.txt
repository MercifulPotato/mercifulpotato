They are prone to human error, especially ones that modify the data, and in a way that can be hard to sort (i.e.iterating over the dimensions of the wrong object).  A stepwise creation of new logical fields using mutate, and then a vectorised ifelse command is more robust and you can clearly see steps of the logic.')
