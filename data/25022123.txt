Household ammonia is only about a 3% solution.  No big deal.  30% ammonia can give you a nosebleed if you sniff it.  Break a couple bottles of 30% ammonia in a closed room, and people entering that room without an air supply will likely die.  TFA doesn&#x27;t mention the concentration they would use for fuel, but surely the higher the better.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to work on a ship running that stuff.  Small leaks of various things are way too common, and ammonia is way too dangerous.')
