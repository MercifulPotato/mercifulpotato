I think characterizing self-governing enterprises as capitalist is a contradiction in terms, but hey, if that&#x27;s what it takes...<p>I see workplace democracy as a pole in the axis of alternatives to capitalism. On one side, you have a market economy where private enterprise is dominant but governed by its own workers, and the other being the democratically planned economy. Both fit the definitions and frameworks for socialist post-capitalism economies. We&#x27;ve seen trials of the latter, but I&#x27;m very curious as to what the former at an economy scale would look like. It seems like a very promising mode of economic organization, that despite being very old in conception, didn&#x27;t really get a fair shake outside of very short term experiments at scale.')
