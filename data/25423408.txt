Growing up playing with my mates, Mario, Zelda , street fighter then Goldeneye, Tony hawk&#x27;s. We just never came across them. Then final fantasy 7 came along, I remember my friend just left it back to the shop. Turn based combat and experience points made no sense to us at all. Few years later I tried playing Knights of the old Republic, it didn&#x27;t feel like a game. It just felt really odd and awkward to me. Skip forward few years and this type game is huge. I don&#x27;t get it and never will I guess! The bit I really don&#x27;t get is you don&#x27;t get better at the game by becoming more skillful but instead by spending time increasing xp on grindy tasks. One thing about games though, they can be sort of mindful: recently I went through a really hard month at work. I found playing old Ps1 racers helped me quickly unwind before bed.
