We already enforce standards to validate that products will not do things like burst into flames, or emit toxic gases. It is equally reasonable to require that products being sold to customers meet acceptable levels of protection for private data.<p>Additionally, you are still welcome to make that trade-off for yourself. Regulation requires that you are informed and in some cases consent to data-gathering. It does not require it to not exist.')
