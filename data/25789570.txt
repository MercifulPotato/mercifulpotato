It already has a lot of features, but my TODO list is growing each day.<p>My next steps there are:<p>- EMail support (maybe MJML?) \n- Plugin Support \n- API Documentation<p>I recently got interested in LiveView, like the one that is  implemented in Phoenix Framework (or Hotwire). I think that a pretty nice feature that i like to implement into ZenTS...<p>I posted it once on HN, but didn&#x27;t catch any attention. I also posted it in &#x2F;r&#x2F;typescript, but mods didn&#x27;t unlock the thread for unkown reasons. So i&#x27;am definitely looking for more feedback. Anyhow, i really enjoy doing open source, even it&#x27;s pretty hard to get any attention from users (or any users at all), if you don&#x27;t set your food into a niche or something really new and awesome (i know, MVC frameworks are not).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sahachide&#x2F;ZenTS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sahachide&#x2F;ZenTS</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zents.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zents.dev</a>')
