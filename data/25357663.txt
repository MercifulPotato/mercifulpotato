I used Arch Linux (arguably the best Linux experience I&#x27;ve had by far) on Thinkpad for 3 years and used Nexus&#x2F;Pixel for 5+ years. Starting from last year I finally had enough and switched back to Macbook + iPhone. God were the devices much, much reliable and my life much easier. At least I didn&#x27;t have to worry about random stuffs like Bluetooth disconnection, lack of proper HiDPI support or the camera taking 5 seconds to start&#x2F;simply freezing.')
