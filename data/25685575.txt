I wonder if fellow doctors would be okay with using a simple structured language to describe data in an EMR.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  Height: 175 cm\n  Weight: 70 kg\n\n  Ethnicity: white\n  Age: 40 years\n  Creatinine: 0.9 mg&#x2F;dl\n</code></pre>\nAn inference engine could use that data to calculate lots of things. Simple stuff like body mass index and creatinine clearance. The patient could be automatically classified in all possible scores given available data.<p>Doctors already do this work, we even input this exact same data into calculator apps. The innovation would be recognizing this data in the EMR text and doing it automatically. I think it would be a huge gain.')
