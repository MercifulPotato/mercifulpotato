I&#x27;m honestly quite surprised that Google permits it, but I&#x27;m glad that they do.<p>Someone has to challenge the ridiculous American cultural taboos surrounding the human form.  I think YouTube is a terrible dangerous tarpit of censorship, a sort of societal &quot;attractive nuisance&quot;, but they should be credited with challenging ridiculous unnecessary censorship norms when they take steps in the <i>right</i> direction for once.')
