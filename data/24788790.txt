I guess it&#x27;s relatively unexciting - until you hear him talk about guns.<p>In my opinion there&#x27;s a narcissism epidemic going on. Charisma is seen not just as a trait but as a value. Everyone wants some. It&#x27;s lumped together with good leadership, extroversion etc. Charismatic selfish people are praised as CEOs, celebrities, youtubers, politicians, actors. And enthralled people keep making excuses for them! And calling YOU crazy.<p>For many people it&#x27;s true that narcissists are all around, and it&#x27;s easy to explain! Kind, selfless, charitable people are narcissist magnets(They will keep making excuses). Also people from messed up families, who didn&#x27;t develop healthy boundaries(Does fish know it&#x27;s under water?). They are easy to impress and exploit. Narcissists and manipulators can sense weakness. By contrast, if you&#x27;re assertive, you repel them without knowing and it may seem like the problem is overblown. Both earlier kinds of people end up being marginalized.<p>I have another issue with Dr Ramani and why she&#x27;s not a complete source on narcissim. She&#x27;s great for theory and the big picture but gives few examples of things narcissists actually say and how you might counteract it.')
