Not sure if there might not be a US bias as well But I enjoy the advantages. Perhaps because I live in a comparatively well organised country but I have never had an issue with technology. My phone and computer update correctly.<p>The benefits in summer are fantastic. I love having the time outdoors in the evening. Family gatherings. Not having to cook bbq in the dark. Sports. If we kept DST permanent year round to keep those benefits then the kids would be cycling to school in the dark in winter. It is such a small adjustment to improve quality of life. I have never understood why it is so unpopular. It might be particularly favourable at my latitude. I get why people near the equator would not want it.')
