So how do you do it? If for example there is a topic I don&#x27;t know about, how do you grasp the jargon, is there a tool to fetch jargon on a topic. Or how do you approach navigating your way through the mess of search engines, how do you find fairly biased content (not too much, preferably unbiased)? I know reading books is a good idea in this case, however not everything is in books or not in the way I can grasp.<p>Are there any machine learning tools that specialize in creating a report for things you need, I know of freelancers who do that thing.<p>How do you do it? What medium of knowledge has the most bandwidth of good information? Is it worth it to go the later pages in the search engines?<p>I know this is a broad question I am asking, I like to know your opinion and if you have some facts, book recommendations or anything that could be of help don&#x27;t hesitate to share it.<p>Thanks for your consideration.')
