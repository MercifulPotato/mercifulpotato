And that&#x27;s not a bad thing!  People couldn&#x27;t survive so well without a sense of what good things worked for you.<p>But I think as you get older (unless you&#x27;re exceptionally alert and open-minded), this confirmation bias of your own success starts to close your mind off to new, different thoughts and pathways.   Unless you actively make it a point of erasing and making space for new ideas, you fall back on the old and don&#x27;t seek out the new to fill your mind.')
