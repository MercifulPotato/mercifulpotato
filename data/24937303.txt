They don&#x27;t want to be held liable for the things people post on the distribution infrastructure they provide. Fine - I get that and it makes a lot of sense. However, even having that protection, they now want to control what is shown on their infrastructure. The whole reason they have this protection is so they CAN let anyone post without fear of litigation.<p>I see it as a one-or-the-other kind of thing. Choose one of the 2 options: Censor absolutely nothing thats not patently unlawful OR censor things to keep yourself out of legal trouble because you ARE liable for the words distributed by your infrastructure.<p>Choose one or have a choice made for you I say.<p>More likely and what I personally believe happened; Hillary lost the 2016 election and the Democrats went nuts about Russian interference via social media. It HAD TO BE THE RUSSIANS as its simply impossible that our system of elections could produce a result where she didn&#x27;t win. The social media elite realized &quot;HOLY SH*T OUR PLATFORM CAN SWAY ELECTIONS??!!! COOL!!!&quot;. On that discovery they decided it was their moral obligation to sway our elections THE RIGHT WAY THIS TIME.<p>Personally, I dont care who, I dont care why, I dont care if its &quot;a very good reason&quot;. All forms of censorship have no place in a free society. Not by the government. Not by private enterprise. Sure as hell not by the unelected likes of Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.')
