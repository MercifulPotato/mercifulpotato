It&#x27;s far from perfect technology, but it&#x27;s pretty good on a $5&#x2F;mo droplet. There are about 30 people, no official rules, and it&#x27;s worked nicely as a small community for about two years. It&#x27;s been especially valuable in the last nine months or so.<p>I&#x27;ve tried setting up bulletin boards to achieve that same sense of community, but it never worked for me. BBSs were definitely important to me as a teenager, but even in that realm my favorite part was chatting with the sysop in real time. I think low-latency communication is better in general for fostering community.')
