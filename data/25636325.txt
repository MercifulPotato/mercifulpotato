Check your email to complete the process.<p>Furthermore, the people you listed above have been found to have conflicts of interest regarding this declaration. The medical and public health communities have soundly rejected this declaration. This declaration makes no sense if you examine it with any kind of critical eye. Start with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Barrington_Declaration#Reception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Barrington_Declaration#R...</a> and from there check the linked sources.<p>There is no censorship in the media regarding medical research of COVID-19. There is fact checking. Just because <i>you</i> believe something that is false and the media isn&#x27;t reporting that falsehood as fact does not mean the media is censoring you. It means it&#x27;s false. Occam&#x27;s Razor will quickly tell you that the chances of a global conspiracy are much lower than the chances of what you are saying here being false. Think about just how many people would have to know about this conspiracy and all of them would keep it perfectly secret. Every news organization in the world would have to collectively conspire to keep the truth from us, right? Every journalist, every editor, every publisher, every news anchor, every weatherman, every sportscaster, every public official. Do you know how quickly that would unravel? I know it&#x27;s easy to believe a conspiracy because it&#x27;s so appealing but it&#x27;s just not what is going on.<p>The platform is an indirect indication: if the scientific community rejects your hypothesis, it&#x27;s most likely because your hypothesis is bullshit. Think critically for a moment the way they taught in you middle school and realize that what you are quoting are unverified unreliable sources and fringe ideas. If you were saying that drinking motor oil cures COVID you&#x27;d have about as much credibility. I am done trying to argue with you because you are not worth arguing about, but I do beg you to use your head and think instead of falling for every damn hoax out there like you seem to have. Happy New Year and stay safe.')
