Sometimes it seems to be a split of the Free Software Foundation due to some kind of personal disagreement (which I&#x27;m not interested in).  Their &quot;about&quot; page mentions vaguely the &quot;principles of software freedom&quot; but does not state precisely what do they mean by that.  I assume that they are not the same as Stallman&#x27;s four freedoms, since some of the ethical licensing stuff that they push is clearly non-free.<p>Can anybody here add some context about the need and the main purpose for the SFC? (in opposition to the clearly stated goals of the FSF)')
