We&#x27;re no longer there.<p>Perhaps banning social media isn&#x27;t the way. But focusing on the <i>humans</i> that find leverage points in the system to amplify bad messages also doesn&#x27;t solve the fact that the system is designed to maximize ordinary people&#x27;s ability to create self-sustaining societal doom loops.<p>Banning guns might be overreach. But banning something that&#x27;s the functional equivalent of distributing assault rifles to millions of toddlers seems like a necessity in a free society.')
