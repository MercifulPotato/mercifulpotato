This is what &quot;payment for order flow&quot; really means. The broker routes the order to a particular trading venue in exchange for a cut of the potential price improvement, with the rest going to the customer.<p>What&#x27;s worth knowing about Robinhood is a) they did not disclose that they were being paid for order flow and b) that they contracted to receive a much larger cut of the potential price improvement than was typical; e.g. other brokers might take $0.01 of that improvement, whereas Robinhood was taking $0.04.')
