Also on top of it Gates isn&#x27;t there in charge to be ruthless any more (and the competitors today knows the things to watch out for).<p>But more importantly than all that... MS knows they aren&#x27;t competing with other companies per-se but rather ecosystems, open source and developer mindshare. If we don&#x27;t like it we can fork off things and go on our way (like developers did during the Ballmer era despite him jumping around chanting developers....).<p>Windows isn&#x27;t even the most used personal OS today, Android is.<p>Funnily enough thanks to MS in part, not because they sabotaged Nokia (Many N insiders have spoken about how dysfunctional and unfocused their management was even before MS came into the picture), But rather because they fucked over their enthusiastic WinPhone7 users, retailers and devs with WP8 not supporting the prev generation of devices and API&#x27;s changing.<p>WP7 had a far snapper and easier to understand UI than contemporary Android devices, but once they dropped the WP8 news the old devices just lay on shelves and sellers who had bet on WP7 selling were left with un-sellable devices and didn&#x27;t feel like buying a new batch to see it happen again.')
