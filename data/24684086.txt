Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[24684284], score=None, time=1601865898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683815, text='&gt; However, I think treating this as the abandonment of meritocracy is a straw man. Discourse with other grads changed my mind. A key factor is how much the test is now being gamed.<p>&gt; Based on some facebook polls of ~500 alumni (not scientific but moreso than any other direct evidence presented!), the percentage of accepted students going through specialized test prep has climbed from &lt;2% in my day to &gt;50% today. Some of these programs cost thousands of dollars for a chance to change your admissions outcome.<p>The median income for a family in Fairfax county is over $140,000. A few thousand dollars isn’t a lot of money for them. It surely is for some people, which is why I would support a holistic admissions system. But I’m not sure why, for everyone else, we can’t just treat that as the cost of doing business. Especially if, as you say, everyone is doing it. Everyone studies for the LSAT, the MCAT, etc.<p>Now, if your point is that it’s a bit mental to treat admissions for a high school like admissions to medical school, in sympathetic to that argument.')
