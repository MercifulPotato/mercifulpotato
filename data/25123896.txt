Item(by='magicalhippo', descendants=None, kids=[25123926], score=None, time=1605622296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25123157, text='&gt; An additional desktop will be created.<p>For those not familiar with Windows internals here&#x27;s the documentation for the desktop[1] object.<p>In particular note the following:<p><i>&quot;Window messages can be sent only between processes that are on the same desktop. In addition, the hook procedure of a process running on a particular desktop can only receive messages intended for windows created in the same desktop.<p>...<p>During the user&#x27;s session, the system switches to the Winlogon desktop when the user presses the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence, or when the User Account Control (UAC) dialog box is open.<p>The Winlogon desktop&#x27;s security descriptor allows access to a very restricted set of accounts, including the LocalSystem account. Applications generally do not carry any of these accounts&#x27; SIDs in their tokens and therefore cannot access the Winlogon desktop or switch to a different desktop while the Winlogon desktop is active.&quot;</i><p>Thus the exploit program shouldn&#x27;t be able to press &quot;Yes&quot; on the UAC dialog. It seems the paper mentions this as well, but I didn&#x27;t have time to study the rest of the paper to see how they overcome this to do interesting stuff.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;winstation&#x2F;desktops" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;winstation&#x2F;de...</a>')
