It wasn&#x27;t until Tom and I started working on this business that I even learned the word klobasnek&#x2F;klobasniky.<p>I feel we&#x27;re fighting an uphill battle already with kolache vs kolace vs kolacky vs kolach, etc<p>Additionally the polish vs the czech versions are slightly different. Here in Chicago, the Polish kolaczki is often quite flaky with a drier dough and more like a dough square folded in over a fruit filling.<p>In Texas a <i>true&#x2F;traditional</i> Czech kolache is often a soft, pillowy sweet ROUND pastry with the fruit filling.<p>However, despite all that, in Texas, especially in Houston, &quot;kolache&quot; is often just used as a catchall, even if not super accurate. But there are 50 &quot;kolache&quot; shops in Houston and no &quot;klobasnek&quot; shops.<p>We did debate it for a while, but we opted for just going with the grain rather than trying to be more correct.<p>Admittedly, there&#x27;s a little bit of cowardice in that, but we decided there were enough challenges ahead, so we didn&#x27;t want to add that extra journey.')
