I&#x27;m curious how the SAT and ACT standardized testing in the US came into the position of almost de-facto standardized college entrance exam. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve wondered why a similar thing doesn&#x27;t exist in the real estate industry for home inspections. A good inspection costs a lot of money, and it seems basically every serious buyer needs to pay for it themselves. Why doesn&#x27;t the seller pay for one up front and share the results with interested buyers? Certainly there&#x27;s room for corruption &#x2F; cheating, so maybe that&#x27;s why? The same concerns would apply for a standardized whiteboarding. Not to mention that some kind of interview would have to happen anyway just as a context for getting to know a candidate. Personally, I think it&#x27;s actually good that this happens in a technical context and, as others have said, is not completely based on a verbal conversation.')
