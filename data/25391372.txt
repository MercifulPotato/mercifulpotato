You need both because no social hierarchy can fully account for the reality (or hyper-reality) it is in and needs to be challenged to adapt to the ever-changing landscape. You need maintenance of social-hierarchies, because mostly they are quite effective at generating the most positive outcomes for the largest number of people (at least at the point when they were generated).<p>Reiterating my comment in another sub-thread: It looks like TIV might be maladaptive because it is highly correlated to anxious-attachment styles, which usually results from poor childhood attachment. Someone with a very healthy attachment-style is unlikely to suffer from TIV (according to the paper). That being said, even individually maladaptive personalties can be adaptive for their social contexts, because if a social-hierarchy starts to generate a lot of victimhood that is probably a strong signal to healthy members of that social-hierarchy that the hierarchy they are in is generating too many negative outcomes and needs to be corrected somehow.')
