I would hypothetically fall in to the category of being &#x27;outraged&#x27; over not explicitly mentioning the fact that the burger that I eat contains soy instead of very low quality meat. especially if I have the expectation of a regular mcdonalds burger. There is enough grey area in what is fit for human consumption when you look at certain additives sugar replacement and now you allow companies to not even have to put meat in a product that pretends to contain meat?<p>Hypothetical ofcourse as I dont go to mcdonalds')
