Racialized exclusion of Black people from the economy has essentially created a captive class -- a pool of bodies for exploitation. Essentially the industry of incarceration at the state (that is both State and Federal level) create sources of income -- for the States, the companies that supply resources to prisons, as well as the private prisons.<p>Further, Gilmore [2] makes the argument that we need to do away with the presumption that there are people who are &quot;deserving&quot; of prison. Is the very notion of prison consistent with a civilized society?<p>Just a further note that the incarceration rate of Black men in the U.S. [5] is comparable to that of Uyghur population in Xianjiang [6] -- that rate was estimated to be 5% for Black men across the U.S. in 2009, 5% for Uyghurs in non-Muslim majority districts, roughly 10% in majority-Muslim districts. It would be interesting to understand how the adoption of capitalist economic practices in China correlates with the rise of the carceral.<p>[1] Golden gulag: Prisons, surplus, crisis, and opposition in globalizing California \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucpress.edu&#x2F;book&#x2F;9780520242012&#x2F;golden-gulag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucpress.edu&#x2F;book&#x2F;9780520242012&#x2F;golden-gulag</a><p>[2] Abolition Geography and the Problem of Innocence.
