I&#x27;ve traditionally liked the fact that the box is complete, and also having a few spare chargers&#x2F;headsets around.<p>But then I considered exactly how many old bits of redundant charger&#x2F;headphone I&#x27;ve accumulated, and my family members.<p>This is a case where economic costs&#x2F;profits and underlying resource constraints, as hoped, align. Let people reuse what they&#x27;ve got, or apply the fractional savings towards something they choose, rather than a baseline that&#x27;s bundled for them.<p>If some consumers will react too negatively, Apple could throw in a gift-certificate good enough for an entry-level charger&#x2F;headset, or applicable to the higher cost of something better.')
