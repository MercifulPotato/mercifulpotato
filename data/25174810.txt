That&#x27;s feature completeness, right? The big issue seems to be that Wayland doesn&#x27;t actually _do_ much. So everyone has to agree on how to handle copy&#x2F;paste, screen sharing, etc. And sometimes Gnome and wlroots do things differently, and that causes problems. But it has nothing to do with the Wayland compositor not being feature complete.')
