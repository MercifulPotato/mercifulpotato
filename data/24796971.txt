As is often the case this step is flawed, but generally the idea is the card (well the chip on the card) and the terminal get to negotiate about what&#x27;s going to happen next.<p>So I think it&#x27;s possible for a card to <i>insist</i> upon doing a PIN transaction <i>if</i> that&#x27;s possible, while still retaining the ability to authorize a no-PIN transaction if the terminal says it doesn&#x27;t do PINs.<p>It&#x27;s also possible for the card or the terminal to have value-related thresholds, in line with the issuer&#x27;s appetite for risk so e.g. maybe a bag of chips from a vending machine with no PIN is a risk the bank can live with, but a $3000 diamond engagement ring not so much.<p>Because the chip has (some) memory it can even have state, maybe one $1.50 bag of popcorn from an offline no-PIN terminal is fine, and so is two, but before you can do a third tiny off-line transaction you&#x27;ll need to do a real transaction or visit an ATM or other online system with the card so it be reassured everything is on the up-and-up.')
