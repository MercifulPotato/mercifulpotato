Since text is usually nicer to work with, transcriptions are very useful, and in theory ML would be able to help with that, but to train a speech-to-text model, you first need transcribed training data, leading to a chicken-and-egg problem. Making the data easily available and easy to contribute to is more likely to be impactful.<p>For maintaining a community, ML can be useful by providing all the services that ML offers for speakers of more popular languages: text-to-speech, speech-to-text, predictive smartphone keyboards, machine translation, ... but all of those depend on the language being well-documented already. Otherwise, non-ML solutions are likely to be the only options (so formant-based speech synthesis e.g. with espeak-ng, dumb keyboards, rule-based translators, ...)<p>To give a specific example, I know of a community of Kabyle speakers who want to be able to use OpenStreetMap with voice navigation in Kabyle, so they&#x27;ve been making a lot of recordings (using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tatoeba.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tatoeba.org</a> as a platform for the documentation part) and also have someone working on a speech-synthesis model (using Mozilla&#x27;s DeepSpeech, I think). AFAIK, the project is coordinated by Muhend Beqasem, whom you might want to contact if you&#x27;re interested in what they&#x27;re doing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tatoeba.org&#x2F;eng&#x2F;user&#x2F;profile&#x2F;belkacem77" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tatoeba.org&#x2F;eng&#x2F;user&#x2F;profile&#x2F;belkacem77</a>')
