I also commuted by bicylce and I thought it was great. Sometimes the highlight of my day!<p>But people in general don&#x27;t like having their options constricted even if it&#x27;s for the greater good. It&#x27;s human nature and I think the best ways forward are to get people excited about the electric future. &#x27;In 10 years electric cars will be so good you&#x27;ll forget we ever bothered with petrol&#x27; would probably be a more effective way to get people excited. Unfortunately that&#x27;d need to come from a pretty credible source, and they&#x27;d get the credit for it, and so in the absence of that - just make this law! It&#x27;s easy, and who will be around in 10 years (in politics) anyway?... That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m raising my eyebrows a bit at this.')
