Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=[25235525], score=None, time=1606539520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234639, text='&gt; It&#x27;s intended to mollify any concerns of well-meaning whites that POC might actually really be upset with racial discrimination, and actually want significant change beyond superficial proposals.<p>First, you have no idea of my intent, because I didn&#x27;t tell you. Second, what you allege to be my intent is not my intent. Third, conceding for the sake of argument that you were right about my intent, why is it that the measured facts totally contradict your narrative, i.e. those who want radical change appear to be overwhelmingly white and particularly non-black?<p>Are you one of those who think logic and data are tools of the white oppressor?')
