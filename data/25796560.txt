Unions in the US are legally enshrined as the exclusive representative of all members of a &quot;unit&quot; which has a precise legal definition which is approximately a group of non-management workers with a well-defined role (e.g. line workers in a factory, butchers in a supermarket, teachers in California) [1]. When a union is formed, <i>all</i> members of the unit are represented by the union including individuals who are not members of the union [2]. This also means that once a union is formed representing the unit, all non-official unions of the form you are suggesting are legally superseded by the official union.<p>I believe this to be an accurate reading of the law as, as far as I am aware, there are no competing unions anywhere in the US unlike many countries in Europe which appear to have competing unions, though I am not particularly familiar with European labor markets.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlrb.gov&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;key-reference-materials&#x2F;national-labor-relations-act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlrb.gov&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;key-reference-materials&#x2F;nation...</a> Sec. 9 159 (b)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlrb.gov&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;key-reference-materials&#x2F;national-labor-relations-act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlrb.gov&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;key-reference-materials&#x2F;nation...</a> Sec. 9 159 (a)')
