We currently live in a world of finite resources. Eventually the laws of thermodynamics will apply as we live in a physical system.<p>Say you had a note that corresponded to having a hamburger. As long as the note actually is convertible for a hamburger it has basically a fixed value and is therefore useful. It might even be more valuable in the future if a burger costs more $. What happens when there are more notes than hamburgers available? Nothing bad might happen for a while. What about if there are all of a sudden 1000 hamburger notes for every physical hamburger? What if at a certain time more people want a hamburger than there is supply for? The hamburger note devalues and becomes worth less than an actual hamburger.')
