Item(by='ymnska', descendants=None, kids=[25653559], score=None, time=1609884968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651904, text='&gt; <i>What is the &#x27;punishment&#x27; for not getting to a call on time?</i><p>There is no formal one, just more of an implication.<p>If you miss one page, people will notice, and you might get asked about it the next day. If it&#x27;s just the one, it&#x27;ll probably end there. But if it ever turned into a pattern you can be sure that you&#x27;re manager would bring it up in your 1:1s (despite them not being on any on-call rotation of course). It would likely not be a fireable offense, but it&#x27;d be made very clear that there&#x27;d be an expectation for you to improve.<p>I suspect that this is more or less how it works at a lot of companies with similar setups.')
