You need shared state for a data race, but not for a race condition.<p>For example if you send a request to two web services, then wait for responses from either, then that&#x27;s a race condition on which result comes back first, because the non-deterministic timing can change program behaviour. And that&#x27;s not even necessarily a problem or a bug.<p>You can easily get race conditions even in a system that tries to minimise shared state, such as Erlang, even though they protect you from data races.')
