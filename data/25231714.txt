Parmesan is a type of cheese that was popularized in two-ish provinces of Italy. It’s not a recipe handed down from God on stone tablets. It’s a product of what people had available at the time and would be different had history been different. Worshiping one specific recipe codified in law that tries to say that literally the exact recipe but made in Montana can’t call itself Parmesan is dumb beyond all reason.<p>Authenticity is a poison on the cooking community and does nothing but make others out of people who should be sharing and experimenting and evolving cuisine taking the lessons from others.')
