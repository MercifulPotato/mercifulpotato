With the absolute plethora of benefits earth gives us, is it really hard to just save what we have than think about these far fetched ideas. Suppose that due to some way we actually figure out a way to move to Mars, would it be better than leaving what we have? I would rather prefer living rest of my life on the dying planet that is earth than move to other planet.')
