Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603860298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914631, text='For those who want to know where those numbers from from.<p>Under the 1909 Copyright Act, it was 28 years which could be renewed for another 28 years, giving a total of 56 years. The work was first published in 1966, giving 1966 + 56 = 2022.<p>The Copyright Act of 1976, the term became life of the author + 50 years for non-corporate works, and 75 years after first publication for corporate works. For works from before 1976 there were still under copyright, it was sort of retroactive.<p>I say &quot;sort of&quot; because instead of simple saying those simply got the new term, keeping their original start date, it changed their renewal term from 28 years to 47 years, which gives 75 years. Works that were still in the first term would still have to renew to get that 47 year renewal term. Anyway, 1966 + 28 + 47 = 2041. (Yes, I know that is not 2040. No, I don&#x27;t know why not. (Well, I know why 1966 + 28 + 47 is not 2040...)).<p>The 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act (which, BTW, is the only copyright term extension in the US that Disney lobbying might have actually influenced [1]) changed the term for corporate works to be 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is earlier.<p>1966 + 95 = 2061.<p>[1] There have only been two copyright term extensions in the US since Disney was founded. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything on where they stood on the 1976 Act or if they did any lobbying for it. Of course they were in favor of it--but so was nearly everyone else. It made the US system much more compatible with the rest of the world, paving the way for the US to join the Berne Convention.')
