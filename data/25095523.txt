A pandemic.  For this I was ready even before we thought it&#x27;s indeed possible - I have funds in several different banks (debit cards) that allow me to not have to visit a bank physically for several years (even if some of the cards expire in the meantime, or one bank suddenly goes bust)<p>2. AI glitch, identity theft, a bank holiday (this happened to me actually some years ago) that blocks you from accessing banks (and investment brokers if you have nowhere to withdraw your funds) for several weeks&#x2F;months - for that you hold paper cash, physical gold and cryptocurrencies stashed at different physical locations.<p>3. Natural disasters - again some combination of diversified physical and virtual funds<p>4. Legal trouble - yes, even if you are not guilty you could get your funds blocked.<p>I presume you are from the US, hence the purple goggles ;) (I hope I&#x27;m not offending you)')
