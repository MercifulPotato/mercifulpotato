I have heard countless alarms go off, and not once seen a car broken into. I think it&#x27;s better just to have a comprehensive immobiliser.<p>I have also had my car stolen. They had the alarm disabled in seconds, and then had all the time in the world to get it running. The only reason I still have that car is because they stalled it in the middle of the street, and the immobiliser kicked back on, so they fled.<p>That car is now mostly a track car, so it&#x27;s actually got a pin-locked ECU that I pin in before driving it. No amount of hotwiring would get the ECU to work without that pin. Even still, it would just need to be dragged onto a trailer and I&#x27;d never see it again.')
