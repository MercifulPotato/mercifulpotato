You had Commodore, Amiga, HP, Wang, Apple, etc. Even still, IBM&#x27;s PCs were not locked down and were, for the most part, based on an open architecture allowing you to freely upgrade parts. Later down the line (specifically the original IBM PC) when the technology allowed for it, you could even install other operating systems like CP&#x2F;M-86, UCSD p-System, and MS-DOS.')
