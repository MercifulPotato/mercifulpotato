They get sudo privileges on the machines that they should be able to manage.<p>Usually this is exclusively using SSH keys, password authentication is blocked. root login is blocked too, you can only login as a normal user and sudo.<p>It&#x27;s quite easy to manage with ansible itself. Make a configuration file to store public keys and username and that&#x27;s about it. That will work pretty well until the company has 500 employees and wants to invest into a SSO solution to manage authentication company wide (AD&#x2F;kerberos&#x2F;pam).')
