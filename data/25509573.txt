Abusing the system because you know you get one free pass is an invitation to cheat until caught, which is unfair to everyone else.<p>In reality, needing to use your second chance is already failure. If you can&#x27;t internalize that, admit to it, and volunteer to step down, then you aren&#x27;t the type of person who deserved a second chance.')
