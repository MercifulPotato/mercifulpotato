Think Nextel 2.0. No more clunky radios or missed calls—just push a button and get things done.<p>We’re currently a team of 5, searching for our next partner on this journey. At Hardline, you’ll have the autonomy to design and scale a backend capable of connecting millions of deskless workers worldwide. We’ve started with Go and WebRTC, but we’re early enough on this journey to be language agnostic, so you’ll be the one to architect and build the system. You pick the languages. You pick the frameworks and libraries.<p>Our team is mostly located in the Bay Area, but we are excited to work remotely with candidates across North America. Hardline is backed by top VCs behind companies like Intercom, Pilot, Sonos and Slack.<p>Feel free to reach out to me directly seth@hardline.io')
