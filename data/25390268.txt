The HomePod, for instance.<p>&gt; there’s a cheaper product out there that’s inferior to what Apple claims of their new headphones<p>If your claim is that Apple made a product using expensive and tough materials, more expensive than, say, Sony&#x27;s counterpart, and thus that is better, you may be half-right.<p>But if you claim that Apple made a product that sounds better than Bose or Sony&#x27;s counterparts, and has better ANC, that is not verifiable, at least not until there are in-depth reviews out there confirming it.<p>What we know <i>now</i> is that Apple did not include support for high quality audio codecs. That itself is quite a red flag.')
