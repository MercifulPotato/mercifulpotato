Item(by='BuildTheRobots', descendants=None, kids=[24852766], score=None, time=1603315819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24852000, text='Handover is a massive non-trivial problem - I&#x27;m amazed you&#x27;re the only one commenting on it.<p>GSM-R was modification to the 2G mobile phone specification specifically to help with high speed handover, but being 2G it gives pretty awful data speeds (1mbit max iirc). If you google for LTE-R it seems there&#x27;s special provisions to bring that fast handover ability to 4G &amp; 5G networks.<p>As well as the actual radio layer, you&#x27;ve also got the mobility management side of things to consider, for example your IP address. If you&#x27;ve got a video streaming or a SIP call going then when you connect to the next radio tower your IP address has to move across as do any established data sessions - it&#x27;s not just a case of getting a new DHCP lease and cracking on, there&#x27;s some serious network orchestration and session management happening too.<p>(I&#x27;m convinced I read something a few years ago that one of the LTE design goals was to allow handover when moving at 200mph (that number seems stuck in my head), but I&#x27;m failing to find any mention of it outside of the LTE-R results).')
