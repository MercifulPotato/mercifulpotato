I&#x27;ve experienced both systems so I know what the pros&#x2F;cons of each are.<p>Here is another examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;canada&#x2F;british-columbia&#x2F;patients-lives-ruined-as-hip-surgery-waits-grow-1.2976196" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;canada&#x2F;british-columbia&#x2F;patients-liv...</a><p>People in pain (who can&#x27;t work or even walk) waiting 2 or 3 years for hip replacement.  A friend of my mom&#x27;s in BC is 85, needs a new hip and the gov&#x27;t said no.  Not &quot;no, maybe later&quot; it was just &quot;no, you&#x27;re too old for it to be worthwhile&quot;.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is why healthcare is Canada is way more affordable than the US.  The Canadian system is just limited by budget - the provinces set the budget (based on support from the federal gov&#x27;t) and then say &quot;this is how many hip replacements we&#x27;ll do this year&quot;.  And if you&#x27;re not a priority, you wait.<p>While in the US, if you&#x27;re either poor (Medicaid), retired (Medicare) or have good insurance through your employer (majority), you&#x27;ll get care pretty quickly.  But that comes at a cost - a cost about double of healthcare costs in Canada.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying the US system is better.  It&#x27;s outrageously expensive system, leaves many without care and is unsustainable.  But if you&#x27;re a middle class person in the US, don&#x27;t expect the Canadian system will give you the exact same care for free.')
