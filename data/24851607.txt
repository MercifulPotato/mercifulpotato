That sounds kind of intentional. If people are only replying to the claim and never even see the authoritative proof it seems very bad.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a Hard Problem. I&#x27;ve seen people send me twitter links as evidence and it&#x27;s just embarrassingly wrong. Like the sources in the twitter posts didn&#x27;t even say something related to the claim the twitter post did. It was weird that it was viewed so uncritically by people quite familiar with the internet in general.')
