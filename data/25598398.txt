You don&#x27;t need a dbus-daemon that you can&#x27;t restart if you cant talk to systemd. Your parser needs to recognise single-character commands instead of a complex rpc syntax plus an xml parser or javascript vm for filtering. You can&#x27;t honestly believe DBUS isn&#x27;t miles from the robustness of initctl.<p>&gt; IMHO, all that&#x27;s changed is that there&#x27;s more uniformity, meaning a single set of tools can be used to test+harden all such RPC interfaces, and security flaws can be fixed in one place (DBUS itself) rather than requiring theory-level descriptions of vulnerabilities to be communicated to each project, whereupon they&#x27;re hopefully translated to separate one-off patches the affected daemon.<p>Instead of easy-to-audit socket permissions you get a complex mess of xml and javascript filtering rules. This isn&#x27;t progress in terms of security, its quite the opposite. Pounds of additional attack surface and additional obfuscation hindering defense.')
