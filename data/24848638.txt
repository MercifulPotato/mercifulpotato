After a year of misdiagnosis, Doctors found some heavy medication (methotrexate balanced with plaquenil) to help regulate it. One of the medicines side effects was listed as ‘death’ on the label.<p>After a year of experimenting, I found that major diet changes (lots more hearty greens, way less sugar and carbs, no caffeine or alcohol), improved sleep, reduced stress (quit my stressful job) completely alleviated my symptoms. I would still have flare ups from time to time which I reduced via physical therapy &#x2F; exercise (to strengthen muscles supporting my tendons).<p>Just sharing as I had a somewhat similar condition and was surprised that the fix didn’t have to be a pill.')
