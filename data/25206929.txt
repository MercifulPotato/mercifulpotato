It&#x27;s still running fine after 10 years without any big bugs. We didn&#x27;t even get access to the sourcecode so it was all new bugs instead but at least it wasn&#x27;t a big security hole whose database got wiped every week because of Bobby Tables. It had daily backups though that came in handy every week :-)')
