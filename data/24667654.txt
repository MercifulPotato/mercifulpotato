It wasn&#x27;t thought through. Sorry.<p>But it leads to the question of why it matters - should it? If we treat all equally, should it matter? I don&#x27;t see myself as female, but neither a &#x27;man&#x27;, as I don&#x27;t much relate to common cultural depictions of men, which I find distasteful.  I am what I am, names won&#x27;t change that so I don&#x27;t care. Why do you?<p>BTW I know a few trans people and I suspect most of them would roll their eyes at this excessive care not to offend anyone with wrong pronouns. They expect people to get it right but it&#x27;s no disaster if someone got it wrong. None of them are snowflakes. Consideration towards trans people needs more basic considerations such as not being called a freak on public transport (this happened to a tgirl I know).')
