While you can go into issues then sort by a given label, this has to be done actively, and constantly kept up to date.<p>I&#x27;d prefer something more like an &#x27;inbox&#x27;, where issues can be filed into different categories which moves the out of the &#x27;new&#x27; section. This is what most large projects are doing anyway with labels.')
