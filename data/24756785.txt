As an American that worked in the EU and had to implement GDPR compliant systems there is so much FUD spread about it. A lot of it is company momentum to not implement the easy stuff, ie. &quot;we&#x27;ve never encrypted our data. What if we forget the passwords?!&quot; And the rest is ease of access, &quot;marketing needs access to billing information. We&#x27;ve always been able to use it so why should we have to ask permission?&quot;')
