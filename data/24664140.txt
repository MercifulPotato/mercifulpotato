Comedy is one such example: it gives huge rewards to a few celebrities, while a lot of other equally talented people just never manage to be in the right place at the right time.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps especially true for comedy. You can see it when you watch a comic on TV: they&#x27;re much less funny than in person, because you&#x27;re not surrounded by a lot of other laughing people. The same routine by the same person can get little more than snickers when done at somebody&#x27;s open mic night -- unless somebody recognizes that they&#x27;re famous. Celebrity reinforces itself.<p>Burnham is very talented and I&#x27;m sure he worked like crazy to market his work. But he will also tell you the names of a hundred others who are equally talented and worked equally hard, but you&#x27;ve never heard of them. The market for celebrity is very fickle, heaping huge rewards on a few, but drop off rapidly for people who aren&#x27;t in the hump of the long tail.<p>Warren Buffett isn&#x27;t profiting from celebrity in the same sense, but there&#x27;s a similar effect where the biggest winners are lucky as well as smart.
