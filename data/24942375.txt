These are going to be around for probably a decade or two.<p>If you want to build an original product, then yes, it can happen not to align with a megacorp&#x27;s priorities, even if reasonably successful. Found a startup, try to sell it to a megacorp (if it&#x27;s Google, it will likely discontinue the acquired product anyway), or keep it to yourself if you can afford it.')
