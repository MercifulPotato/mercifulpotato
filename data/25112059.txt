Item(by='the_af', descendants=None, kids=[25115497], score=None, time=1605537166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109689, text='&gt; <i>It&#x27;s the same reason you see Coca Cola ads everywhere</i><p>This is one thing I don&#x27;t understand, even though I know it must obviously work (to be clear, I&#x27;m not disputing it works. I just don&#x27;t understand why&#x2F;how). I know their purpose is to &quot;remind you&quot; Coca Cola exists, but unlike with junk removal services, you will never &quot;need&quot; Coca Cola and either you like it or you don&#x27;t. People who like Coca Cola tend to drink it regardless of ads (some are addicts), and don&#x27;t need the reminder. People who dislike Coca Cola won&#x27;t ever drink it and the &quot;need&quot; will never exist in the future, unlike with junk removal.<p>So again, what&#x27;s the rationale for these ads? Who needs a reminder that Coca Cola exists? I bet they are data-driven and their studies show that people do consume more soft drinks after seeing these ads everywhere -- I&#x27;m not disputing this -- but I really don&#x27;t understand why it works.<p>Maybe the target is young kids exposed to these ads for the first time? But in general, the people in Coca Cola ads look like teenagers or in the 20-30 age segment, not kids.')
