WTF is this shit?<p>We do 30 minute blocks with your boss, one director + one developer, one with the CTO and then the wrap up with the internal recruiter.<p>The other departments do roughly the same (finance does comptroller + one of your coworkers at the same level instead of director + developer)<p>Edit: We also make sure to allow the candidate to get some water, pee breaks and take them out for lunch (if it happens it to be during the lunch time)')
