Newtonian physics is still valid and still taught at schools since  it adequately explains the movement of objects at an approximate level that is good enough for most people most of the time. But when dealing with equations at an astronomical scale, Newtonian physics start to break down.<p>Likewise quantum mechanics doesnâ€™t replace General Relativity. It compliments it.')
