The hatred it attracts is unmatched - no topic has reached the front page only to be brigade-downvoted off of it again so regularly.<p>And yet, for all the indignant posts about how it&#x27;s performance art, a scam, or the ravings of a madman, it just kind of keeps on keeping on.  It gets a little more stable and adds a few more features every year, like a regular old open source project.<p>My position on it has remained unchanged for 5+ years: I hope it succeeds because it aspires to solve a use case that I genuinely want to use, I don&#x27;t care about the (ex-)founder&#x27;s politics or his old blog, but seeing as the existence of the latter seems to have destroyed any chance of the former coming to fruition so I&#x27;m kind of hoping Jeff Bezos decides to build a clone (presumably, one that has much lower ambitions and elides most of the weird stuff).')
