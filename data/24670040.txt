My laptop from 2018 has 64GB RAM... and would it even matter to say that I already have several high-performance machines? I am not sure what your point is. I did not buy Raspberry Pis to save money, I bought them to have a bunch of small physical servers to play around with. I could have easily started 8 VMs bridged to the network in the same way with virt-manager&#x2F;QEMU and got 8 much more powerful Linux instances for free if that&#x27;s what I wanted.')
