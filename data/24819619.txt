But just as one example, see my comment elsewhere in this thread about the use of globwalk in this example. That&#x27;s bringing in a ton of code when compared to just using walkdir and checking the file extension directly. The crate ecosystem encourages this kind of emergent behavior.<p>People make the mistake of treating this issue as black and white: either you&#x27;re for or against code reuse. But the reality is far more nuanced. Often, a dependency will solve a much more general problem than what you actually need, and thus, avoiding the dependency might result in solving a considerably simpler problem than what the dependency does. In exchange, you use less code, which means less to audit&#x2F;review and less to compile.<p>Given my position as the author of a few core crates, I actually often find myself advocating against the use of those very crates when the problem could be solved nearly as simply without beinging in the dependency. (I did not author globwalk, but I did author its &#x27;ignore&#x27; and &#x27;walkdir&#x27; dependencies.)')
