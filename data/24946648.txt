Just as, with a bank, your account is a liability unless it makes them money, with a social media platform your data is a liability unless it makes them money. And in exchange for a free platform (or free checking and a pen) you gave certain rights of ownership away. If you want to &quot;recognize the property interest of users&quot; you have to recognize it in that context.')
