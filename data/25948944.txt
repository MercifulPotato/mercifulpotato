The intention of that language was most likely to protect Robinhood if it took emergency actions, such as the circuit breakers on stock exchanges that will halt trading if it looks like the computers are doing something crazy (e.g. irrational sub-second runs&#x2F;crashes of listed stocks).  A court could reasonably say that what is happening with Gamestop today is similar to such situations, that Robinhood can protect itself and investors by not executing trades for the period of the crisis.  What Robinhood definitely could not do under that language is, for example,  halt all trading <i>except</i> on Gamestop.  That would definitely not be a reasonable emergency action.')
