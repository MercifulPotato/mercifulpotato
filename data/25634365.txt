Item(by='fwip', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609780318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634179, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cabal.chat&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cabal.chat&#x2F;</a> is a good program. It does not support all of slack&#x27;s features, but is truly peer-to-peer so there&#x27;s no central points of failure or servers that can go down.  (Well, I suppose if they released a buggy version of the software and you updated, that&#x27;s a central source, but that&#x27;s true of most software.)')
