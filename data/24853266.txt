They had a lot of investors who swallowed this (flawed) business model whole and decided to bankroll it. The people at Quibi don&#x27;t have to care and likely got away with a decent chunk of $$$ regardless of the outcome.<p>Sometimes I wonder if I should actually attempt all the business&#x2F;project ideas I don&#x27;t think would ever work. Dress it up with some marketing and a &quot;good&quot; pitch deck and let some suckers bankroll it. Best case scenario I&#x27;m a multi-millionnaire, worst case I&#x27;ve still got enough to retire on and it seems like the industry doesn&#x27;t see these kinds of astronomical failures as a bad thing so I don&#x27;t even have to sacrifice my career&#x2F;reputation.')
