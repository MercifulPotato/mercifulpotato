The complaint is that they could not point out how he had breached terms of service&#x2F;community guidelines as he was notified his account was terminated because of. If they could poiint to the offending material that would be one thing. If they gave advanced warning and said &quot;Pack your stuff, we&#x27;re done serving you. Period. You have X hours.&quot; It would have been fine.<p>Saying someone did X, Y,  and Z, then refusing to produce evidence is the problem there.')
