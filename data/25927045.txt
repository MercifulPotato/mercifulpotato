It&#x27;s quite remarkable at reducing web page sizes and has an option to render images at a preferred quality, or turn it off altogether. Also, some of the design of the original web page is preserved and it&#x27;s somewhat usable.<p>But the issue with it is all the compression happens on their servers before reaching you, which is troublesome from a privacy standpoint. I wish there was a browser(or a selfhosted instance) similar to Opera Mini which can compress pages before it reaches the client')
