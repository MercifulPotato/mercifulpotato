I can only imagine how losing both parents can feel. Thinking about it more, this is the cycle of life and everyone passes through this phase. This pain and burden makes no exception for anyone. Thinking back, I have developed even more respect for my father based on how he remained strong after losing his father who he loved to the end of the earth. He lost his mother a while ago as well, but he continued to stay strong, and he only continued living for us, his kids. We were his pillars and his strength. The best gift I can give him is to live and love like him, and pass on his ideas to my kids after they enter this world.')
