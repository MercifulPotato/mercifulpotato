However, to achieve acceptable performance, you would almost certainly need to use a lot of &quot;unsafe&quot; code. A performant JavaScript implementation has to be able to generate raw machine code, after all, and then execute it. And the garbage collector probably isn&#x27;t going to manage memory in a way that the Rust compiler can verify for correctness.<p>So no, &quot;use a memory-safe language&quot; isn&#x27;t a simple answer to this kind of bug. Using Rust could reduce the attack surface somewhat but certainly would not completely prevent bugs.')
