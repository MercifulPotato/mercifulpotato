Looking back on my stats I approximately tripled that in direct sales, but I’m sure the actual return was higher as I’m certain some folks went to Amazon instead of my site where I was selling direct at the time. I recently sold out and decided to close down my Shopify store so I can’t provide traffic details but IIRC there was a massive spike in visits when the ad went live.\nGruber’s audience was obviously a no-brainer for this product. And dealing with John, which was brief, was a pleasure.')
