It&#x27;s hard to give a heck about university when it&#x27;s all online-only because of COVID.<p>Cooking for myself requires going outside to buy groceries. Anxiety intensified by the other things makes that difficult.<p>Things were looking up for me in September, graduating, being accepted to a new degree but now it&#x27;s all just like an illusion fading away. Every time I wake up, I&#x27;m crushed by the pressure of all those things and just choose to scroll the internet for 12 hours a day and go to bed as soon as possible.')
