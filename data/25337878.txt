This has not happened since the FDIC was created in the wake of the Great Depression.<p>Another is a <i>sovereign</i> default where the country decides not to honour its obligations to those holding units of its currency or its debts. This has happened ~6 times in the history of the United States, and I do include the cancellation of the gold withdrawal rights as a sovereign default. This has nothing to do with the FDIC <i>or your bank</i>.<p>I can&#x27;t stress this enough, <i>neither</i> of these things matter to you if you do what you&#x27;re supposed to with money, which is not keep your life savings in a mattress or a savings account, but use it as a temporary store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account and <i>buy things with it</i>. Gold, real estate, magic beans, I don&#x27;t care. This is practically ECON-101.<p>On the subject of freedom, backing all currency with gold eliminates my right to choose what I back my personal economy with. A gold backed currency has strictly less freedom than a fiat currency. I can today choose to back my personal economy with gold, silver, platinum, magic beans (crypto) or Apple stock by leveraging a brokerage account and a credit card. If you believe in freedom, it&#x27;s actually what you <i>want</i>.')
