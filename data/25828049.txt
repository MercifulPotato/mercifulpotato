This verdant, unifying feature of plants</i><p>Yet there are plants that lack chloroplasts, and animals that have them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isaaa.org&#x2F;kc&#x2F;cropbiotechupdate&#x2F;article&#x2F;default.asp?ID=12093" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isaaa.org&#x2F;kc&#x2F;cropbiotechupdate&#x2F;article&#x2F;default.a...</a><p>&gt; <i>Reason 3: Molecular Evidence Demonstrates Fungi Are More Closely Related to Animals Than to Plants</i><p>Yet, as said, crocodillians are more closely related to birds than to any other reptile, and are still called reptiles.<p>Biological taxonomy is not completely arbitrary and there is some rhyme to it, but much of that rhyme is gut feeling, and the arguments this article raises can easily be shown to not be so absolute as the article would suggest they are. If the article&#x27;s tone would be to be believed, then the plants that lack chloroplasts, and the vertebrates that lack vertebræ, would no longer be classified as such, and that is clearly not the case.<p>I am not so impressed with mankind&#x27;s seeming compulsion to classify what won&#x27;t, and to invent classification schemes that seem rather wanting to classify for it&#x27;s own sake.<p>This is hardly the biggest problem; the various attempts at classification in psychology have shown to be even more problematic than this.')
