These findings question the validity of SETs and their use in making widespread decisions within a faculty.&quot;<p>I disagree with this conclusion and note that the cookies were provided during the course, not during the evaluation.<p>It seems obvious to me (and should be to anyone who has been in a class) that a course with cookies is a better experience that may indeed result in more knowledge transfer. So this would validate the SET.')
