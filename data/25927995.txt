My project had a web application using web sockets and there were good libraries in Micropython.<p>My take on Micropython is that it is a small community with just a handful of long term dedicated contributors. It is a little rough around the edges, especially when you get into the details of board support other than the pyboard. For example I had issues with interrupts interacting with Python threads in the web sockets library. The documentation was flat out wrong and I had to figure things out on my own.<p>I ordered a couple accessory boards off Amazon, a high precision ADC and a real time clock. Both were fakes. They had swapped out chips with lower grade components. When I ordered from Adafruit I got the real things.<p>The big downside of the Circuit Python fork is that Adafruit deprecated their Micropython libraries for their boards. That seems like it will have long term impact to Micropython.')
