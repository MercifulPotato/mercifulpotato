Isn&#x27;t that great!&quot; That&#x27;s Facebook selling the idea to people. They&#x27;re telling people relatively trivial but fun use cases. Maybe that would make some people buy.<p>However, at no point does it mention what benefit there is to Facebook, which is effectively a constant data stream about the world around us: who is there, what&#x27;s happening, what are people talking about, etc. Google and Apple get similar data streams from mobile phone location data, but a video and audio stream (and lidar maybe) would be a <i>much</i> richer information source. I want to know what their plan is for that data, how FB intends to use it, what I can do to opt out of it, and so on.')
