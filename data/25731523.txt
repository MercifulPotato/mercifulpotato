As long as most of the people in the country believe in democracy, the country will continue to have democracy.<p>The real threat to democracy is allowing leaders to stop following the democratic process.  For example, on 02021-01-06, 147 congresspeople voted to throw out the votes from an entire state, even after their party had pursued the appropriate legal remedies [0].
