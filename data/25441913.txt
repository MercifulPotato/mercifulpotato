I returned it when I saw just how buggy it was.  I don’t have a documented list of bugs, because that’s not how I enjoy games.  Documentation of 1.04 bugs are plenty of places.  You can’t miss them.  They get in the way of playing.  The most annoying bugs are related to weapons and NPCs.  CDPR’s known for their storytelling, but when the game makes the story difficult to consume, then it isn’t worth my money.<p><pre><code>  Flawlessly launched genre defining games:\n   - Quake (and its arena shooter successor: Halo)\n   - Assassin’s Creed\n   - Grand Theft Auto III\n   - Super Mario 64\n   - Your favorite fighting game\n   - Your favorite racing game\n   - Your favorite rhythm game\n   - Your favorite JRPG\n   - Deus Ex\n</code></pre>\nCould you provide even one example of a genre defining game that had a bad launch?')
