The operating systemâ€™s kernel is unaware of what the process is doing until the process issues a system call: at that point, the kernel regains control to perform an operation on behalf of the user, which can be something like reading a file or pausing for a few seconds.<p>[Edit: My first point is actually incorrect - see child comment about &#x27;pico processes&#x27;]')
