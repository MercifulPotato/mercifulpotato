Facebook also has been blocking   &#x2F;deboosting sharing of this article.<p>I see a great deal of bias in these actions by the tech companies. Any  negative unsourced article about the president is allowed to be shared but, articles about his opponent or his adult children are instantly and aggressively de-platformed. It&#x27;s a very scary precedent regardless of your politics.')
