It would be nice though if you could play a full scale&#x2F;octave of notes on the keyboard and marimba.<p>Right now you can only play the first 10 notes (semitones)  of the chromatic scale so it makes it a little unusable musically.<p>It would be awesome and playable if it was:<p>- All 12 semitones plus octave (13 notes total)<p>or if limited space for buttons is an issue<p>- 7 notes of a major scale plus octave (8 notes total)')
