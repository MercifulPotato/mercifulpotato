Some of his claimed inventions were:<p>“telephone that responded to its owner&#x27;s voice and could identify who was calling,[10] a force field that would surround the Beatles&#x27; homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and WALLPAPER SPEAKERS,[11] which would actually be a part of the wallpaper.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magic_Alex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magic_Alex</a>')
