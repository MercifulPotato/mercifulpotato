After you apply this update, it cannot be uninstalled.\n&gt; Note If you must use Adobe Flash Player again on your device after this update has been installed, use one of the following methods:<p>&gt;    Method 1: Reset your device to an earlier system restore point. This feature must be explicitly enabled and a system restore point must have been created on your Windows device before you apply this update.<p>&gt;    For more information about system restore point, see Back up and restore your PC.<p>&gt;    Method 2: Reinstall your Windows operating system, but do not apply this update.<p>I&#x27;ve always heard that &quot;this update cannot be uninstalled&quot;, but thought that was just some marker that appeared in the list of installed updates. But no, it&#x27;ll somehow prevent reinstallationâ€”does anyone know <i>how</i>?')
