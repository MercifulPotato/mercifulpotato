Sometimes the change takes less time that discussing in other channels, and sometimes it&#x27;s easier to explain with code if you are not a native speaker.<p>I think that spending more of a weekend in a PR without checking before with the maintainers is a bad idea, because there is a big risk that is not merged and is a waste of time.<p>Also, each project has it&#x27;s own weird rules, like code style, space vs tabs, changing whitespace in unrelated lines, adding tests, ... and a long list. Some are written explicitly, and some are just implicit rules. So sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to make a PR that follows all the rules.')
