Sadly, Bell Labs now seems like a distant, never-to-be-repeated experiment. There&#x27;s so much intense focus these days on short-term ROI and responding to market pressures. Creativity and discovery very much take a back-seat to predictability and keeping the stock market &quot;happy&quot;.<p>Are there modern-day places like Bell Labs?
