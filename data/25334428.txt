Turns out his business partner was attempting to use it as a pump and dump scheme, and fucked off to Brazil when he heard the Feds were sniffing. But it gets stranger! When Stan Lee himself reacquired control of the content he created for SLM through a new company called Pow! Entertainment after SLM went bankrupt, his former business partner tried to sue him, from federal prison using intermediaries, to reacquire control of <i>all</i> of Stan Lee&#x27;s creations, including Marvel properties like Spider-Man! The ensuing legal battle would dog Lee for the rest of his life -- kinda like how SCO v. IBM is unresolved to this day, there&#x27;s still a little stub of a company trying to assert copyright over Linux.<p>I think Wozniak, like Lee, may have innocently gotten involved with some shady characters. Hey, it&#x27;s California, it&#x27;s the tech industry, these things happen.')
