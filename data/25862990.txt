I certainly wouldn’t.  They’ve demonstrated they can’t advance either the process tech or the chip architecture in any meaningful way.<p>And I don’t even fault the engineers, but rather a finance-oriented CEO who managed for the bottom line, to goose stock prices and executive comp, while cannibalizing the engineering corps of the high-output talent and experienced technical leadership and mentoring necessary to advance one of the most complex, difficult technologies.<p>One possibility here is that Gelsinger is reversing that, rebuilding the original proven team from the top down, starting with the people who both know how that works, and have the connections to and respect from additional top technical talent to bring them on as well.<p>If Gelsinger also restructures compensation for these folks to ensure they’re appropriately compensated (way above “market rate”) then that’s confirmation that this isn’t panic but the right strategy of rebuilding Intel’s talent base.<p>And that report you linked was discussed yesterday, unclear how reliable it is:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25844959" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25844959</a>')
