Woodwork (shop work, joinery) too.  I can think of people in my life for whom cooking without also continuously tidying is anathema.<p>It keeps the deck clear but at a huge efficiency cost.  Some people just can’t stand untidiness, yet learning to live with mid-process untidiness — and the associated anxiety — is a big step towards being more productive.<p>It is certainly not easy.  When coding, I feel a great anxiety if I am mid solution and have a large amount of the current batch left to complete.  It is as if I had taken a gulp of air and dived under the water into a cave.  Batching involves being able to commit to living without safety checkpoints, and to be able to get a batch complete in the time allotted.  If you don’t, you risk having a large pile of four-fifths completed batches.')
