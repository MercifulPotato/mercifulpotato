Item(by='db48x', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605229494, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076483, text='It doesn&#x27;t become safe when you&#x27;re offline, it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re no worse off than you were. OCSP is s a certificate revocation protocol. It&#x27;s only used for disabling certificates which were issued in good faith but now need to be revoked. Suppose Apple signs application X, and the signature is good for a year. Six months later, Apple discovers that application X contains malware, so they revoke the certificate. However, your computer doesn&#x27;t know about the revocation until it checks the OCSP server, which requires you to be online. If you&#x27;re offline, it just skips the check; the certificate wasn&#x27;t revoked yesterday, so it&#x27;s probably fine today too. The bug is that if you&#x27;re connected to a network but can&#x27;t contact the OCSP server (either because the OCSP server is down, or because you&#x27;re not connected to the internet) then OSX keeps trying to connect and becomes sluggish and&#x2F;or unresponsive. This is how we know that it&#x27;s a defect rather than a deliberate choice; if they had decided to make the OS nonâˆ’functional unless connected to the internet they would have done a better job of it.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they one day wanted to require you to be online 100% of the time so that you can&#x27;t skip the OCSP checks on applications, but I don&#x27;t think that would go over very well. Apple wouldn&#x27;t even be the first to produce applications that refuse to work if there&#x27;s no internet connection. If you don&#x27;t like the thought that they might one day spring this on you, I recommend investigating Linux.')
