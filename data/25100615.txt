I&#x27;ve found it to be the best place to get the detailed news I want (for example, Wasserman or Cohn for election result), but know to avoid comments unless I&#x27;m looking for pure entertainment.<p>But, I have all Twitter alerts turned off, and only check every few days. I rarely look at my own Twitter timeline and instead go directly to people&#x27;s timeline who I have found will have the news I&#x27;m interested in.')
