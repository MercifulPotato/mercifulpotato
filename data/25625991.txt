Item(by='morsch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609714116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25624917, text='I&#x27;m sure many people died building the Great Wall, but the reference for &quot;up to a million&quot; is two travel guides[1], and the reference to &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; is a throwaway line in pop science book about the Great Wall, whose author gives no evidence on how she arrived at the number. I couldn&#x27;t find any scholarly articles. Maybe we just don&#x27;t know how many workers died? Or maybe a search in Chinese would be more fruitful. It seems like something that there would at least be a scholarly agreement on an estimated range.<p>This doesn&#x27;t take away from your larger point, which stands regardless of whether ten thousand or a hundred thousand or a million died.<p>[1] I think I&#x27;ll remove those two references from the article, the revision is currently <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Great_Wall_of_China&amp;oldid=998050290" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Great_Wall_of_Chi...</a>')
