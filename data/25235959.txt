There are other bottlenecks which may be narrower than the decoders, and the decoders may not even be used when a uop cache or something like a &quot;loop buffer&quot; (LSD on Intel) is present.<p>So AMD doesn&#x27;t believe that wider chips aren&#x27;t useful or that 4 is a limit, because they went to 5-wide in Zen (or 6, depending on how you count it) and I expect them to go wider in the future.<p>Intel went from 4 wide (narrowest bottleneck) to 5 wide in Ice Lake.<p>Wider chips are the future, and there is no &quot;hard wall&quot; at 4 for x86, just like any earlier width increase: just constantly diminishing returns.')
