Getting an artery stick on a five year old is one of the most awful things I’ve had to endure, but I wasn’t going to trust a five year old on whether she had taken the pills or not. Turned out she hadn’t taken any! But it was super scary, Tylenol poisoning is no joke, and we have lock boxes for all our medications now.')
