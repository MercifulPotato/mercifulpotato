If you increase a company&#x27;s profit by $500k annually<p>Not every job has the potential for such things.  &quot;Good work&quot; is different than profitability.  A factory line worker can be the hardest working and best worker on the planet, and not increase company profits more than a few dollars an hour.  That&#x27;s the point about how we now value work differently.  We place value on work that has direct and immediate impact on the bottom line.  We don&#x27;t value the hard work that goes into just keeping the doors open from day to day.')
