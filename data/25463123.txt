Item(by='Ecco', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608258513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462814, text='Kind of reminds me of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;utf8everywhere.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;utf8everywhere.org&#x2F;</a>, but in that case it&#x27;d be sqlite-everywhere.
