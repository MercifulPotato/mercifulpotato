Looking at this die shot + annotation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;M1.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;M1.png</a> The firestorm cores + 12MB cache is <i>far</i> less than 1&#x2F;3rd the die, and the memory controller doesn&#x27;t look particularly large.<p>The M1 total is 16B transistors. A 2700K on Intel&#x27;s 32nm was 1.1B transistors. You&#x27;re &quot;only&quot; talking something like ~4x the size necessary if that. Of course the 2700K already has a memory controller on it, so you really just need the firestorm cores part of the M1. Which is a _lot_ less than 1&#x2F;3rd of the die size.<p>But lets say you&#x27;re right and it is 1&#x2F;3rd. That means you need ~5B transistors. Nvidia was doing 7B transistors on TSMC&#x27;s 28nm in 2013 on consumer parts (GTX 780)')
