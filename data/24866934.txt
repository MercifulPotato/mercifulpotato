I had an upper and lower endoscopy several years ago, doctor cut out a sizable but not yet cancerous polyp. He told me to get another colonoscopy after three years (or was it one?) but I haven&#x27;t done it yet. The last time I went to a doctor to do it was maybe two years ago. She said, &quot;You&#x27;re too young, how could you have had a polyp?&quot; and sent me home with a take-home DIY stool sample kit instead.<p>I didn&#x27;t have insurance, so I just ignored it. Now I live in Taiwan where everyone has insurance but I STILL haven&#x27;t done it. I&#x27;ll make an appointment today.')
