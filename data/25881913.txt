Suits probably aren&#x27;t all that bad by comparison with what the Shuttle cabin got like near the end of a long mission, especially if the toilet was acting up - a circumstance I gather was regrettably less rare than might be imagined by the na√Øve.<p>It&#x27;s something that science fiction doesn&#x27;t really explore - jokes about Trek&#x27;s near-total lack of sanitary fixtures aside, even self-consciously grittier fiction like the Expanse series seems generally very disinclined to go there. I understand why, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me thinking it&#x27;d be fun to see some hard-sf author really get into the weeds of why and how space makes something as elementary as the cleanly voiding of bodily waste into a surprisingly complex and difficult engineering problem.')
