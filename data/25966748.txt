As a matter of fact, the borrower is encouraged to return more than the amount he borrowed as a show of gratitude, but it cannot be in the loan contract nor implied or enforced in any way.<p>If people are free to practice Islam then they must also be free to choose not to practice Islam and require interest on loans.<p>&gt; Islamic law is there to make a stable and just society, not for us to be wolves and destroy one another, which humans have done time and time again and it&#x27;s never going to change.<p>Respectfully, Iâ€™m not interested in becoming a Muslim.<p>&gt; They are contractually owed a profit.<p>They are contractually owed a payment. Its not profit until expenses are subtracted. And there is always the risk that the other party does not return the money.<p>&gt; They can go after the borrower in case of default with the full support of the law and take not only the principal, but the interest on top.<p>It seems you may have identified a problems with the law then.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t a strong argument because hiring a hitman is also an &quot;investment&quot; or &quot;business transaction&quot;.<p>A hitman is not an investment and as a transaction, it is for the performance of a crime (presumably).
