Quite the opposite.<p>I actually can&#x27;t remember a single time in 15 years where I&#x27;ve ever seen that. Maybe it&#x27;s happened, but I don&#x27;t remember, but I can easily recount tons of poorly performing SQL queries though. Sub-selects, too many joins, missing indexes, dead-locks, missing foreign keys...<p>I&#x27;m not saying it wouldn&#x27;t cause a problem, I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;ve never, ever seen production code where someone dumped tons of data out and then processed it.<p>I have seen people try and make extremely complex ORM calls that were fixed by hand-coded SQL, but that&#x27;s a different problem.')
