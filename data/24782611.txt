Case law prior to section 230 had established that platforms only had liability if they engaged in moderation, but had no liability if they did not moderate in any way. Section 230 was created to address that absurd result of existing law. Protecting platforms that engage in moderation is the <i>whole point</i>, platforms that don’t moderate are already protected. This is why nobody has suggested that AT&amp;T would have civil liability for posts on Facebook even though their wires carry the post to you. Dumb pipes don’t accrue liability.')
