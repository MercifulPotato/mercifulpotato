I&#x27;ve been a customer for a year or two and have always been super frustrated with the performance of their web &amp; mobile apps, and their customer service.<p>I only joined and stuck around because the 1% interest rate was better than anything else I could find at the time. Since their rate dropped I transferred all of my money away.<p>I&#x27;m with Yotta &amp; Onefinance today.<p>Yotta offers &gt;1% interest rate when you calculate it all out. Definitely not anywhere near the 2-3% the people are mentioning in the the comments.  They also just recently dropped the # of tickets you get on deposits above $25k which doesn&#x27;t help.<p>One finance offers a 1% rate up to $25k &amp; 3% on an account that can be funded by diverting up to 10% of your direct deposits. They also have &quot;Pockets&quot; which I think is similar to what Simple did but tbh I never use any of that stuff...I&#x27;m just a rate chaser.')
