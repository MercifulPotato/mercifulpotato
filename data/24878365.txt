Luckily we already have that! ;-)<p>Personally I believe we already have the solution to the energy problem in the form of hydrogen gas, which can be made from seawater in harmless and well known ways. Water which is returned when the energy is consumed, so the possibility of also solving the water crisis at the same time seems worth exploring.<p>It&#x27;s hard to even theorize about a more optimal solution.<p>The sun is for all earthly intents a limitless power source, and we now have the technical means of capturing and storing it without permanently consuming any resources on earth. So why don&#x27;t we just do that? Why are not all energy projects supporting that optimal solution instead of pursuing other goals?<p>Even nuclear proponents are hopefully mostly interested in nuclear as a means to an end, and not just nuclear as a thing in itself.<p>There are challenges with both solar panels and hydrogen gas for sure, but as far as I can tell all of them are small compared to the various challenges around nuclear power.<p>Elon Musk should get on this, he has most of the pieces of the puzzle already!<p>Have the Boring company make underground storage caves for hydrogen, let Solar City make the gas, and use tech from SpaceX to store and burn it optimally! :)')
