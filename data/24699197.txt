Not in a strictly rational sense. Utilitarianism does not bridge the &quot;is-ought gap,&quot; for instance.<p>(I actually think the &quot;is-ought gap&quot; is an imperfect way to look at it, but that&#x27;s a simplified way for me to try to explain my objection to these kinds of theories, which may be understandable to people who have at least taken Philosophy 101).<p>Personally, I&#x27;m quite convinced that it&#x27;s impossible to create a rationally justified moral theory that grants rights to animals.')
