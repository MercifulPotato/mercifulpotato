It sucks that the news lies so much, but people can do research, but no one does, because it takes sooo much time and is kinda stressful. I get why they dont, but it&#x27;s dangerous to blindly believe the news. In the end, news organizations are just money making bussinesses, their is no law that says they must tell you the truth. It&#x27;s also not possible to have fake news laws, and u dont want them anyway, they are very dangerous.')
