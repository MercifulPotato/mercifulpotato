Based on that, your recognition that this issue somewhat breaks down along worldview lines makes sense to me.<p>[Disclaimer: The following is a description of <i>my current thoughts</i> on the topic. I could very well be wrong, but I thought sharing them might make for an interesting discussion.]<p>That said, I have an anti-PC view on this topic that AFAICT is somewhat a-religious. My <i>perception</i> (i.e., I very well may be wrong) has been that the pro-PC arguments I&#x27;ve heard contain some logical inconsistencies that I&#x27;ve been unable to resolve. And that some organizations with pro-PC policies use <i>ad baculum</i> or <i>ad hominem</i> attacks to avoid serious debate about their position&#x27;s weaknesses. I think it&#x27;s obnoxious to force others to obey their moralizing while refusing to submit their views to serious debate.')
