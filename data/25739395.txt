The actual principle is &quot;equal justice before the law&quot; (there are variations). Justice is an important part of the principle since otherwise &quot;The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal loaves of bread&quot;. Not to mention such evils as selective enforcement and prosecutorial discretion.<p>Few people these days would insist that equality of outcomes is a legitimate goal, though the extent to which disparity of outcomes is treated as a &quot;code smell&quot; at least potentially indicating a societal problem worth examining does vary fairly predictably across the US political spectrum. The  appetite for instituting solutions when a systemic problem is demonstrably found also varies fairly predictably.')
