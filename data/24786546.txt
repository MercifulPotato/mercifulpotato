Of course, in reality it was actually the whole of Europe who ended up frantically closing all their borders far too late, whilst the US stuck to targeted and relatively timely travel restrictions - if I recall correctly, pretty much the exact opposite of the &quot;prophetic&quot; anti-Trump fiction.)')
