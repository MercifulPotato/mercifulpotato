Rather the article recognizes that powerful type systems (more powerful than in many mainstream languages, perhaps) are a great tool to enforce certain invariants. However, those type systems (dependently typed ones, in particular) are also complex and often fickle beasts. The article suggests that it may therefore be worth replacing them with different, less powerful, but easier to work with approaches.')
