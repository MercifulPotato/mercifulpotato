Item(by='ruste', descendants=None, kids=[25337759], score=None, time=1607361998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334214, text='The meta-analysis is based on NO levels in the home, not stove use. Primarily this relates to gas heating. I&#x27;m aware of what it says. I&#x27;m not sure how what you&#x27;re saying relates to my points.\nIt looks to me like this article is saying &quot;Here&#x27;s good research showing that NO is linked to a 40% higher rate of asthma. Stoves produce NO so they must cause a 40% higher rate of asthma.&quot; without a study connecting the two directly. And all of this based on a meta-analysis that doesn&#x27;t attempt to control for a primary trigger of asthma.')
