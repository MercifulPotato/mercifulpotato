Even tried launching one last year to compliment the temporal qualities of hacker news. Had decent initial engagement on it but it eventually faded, it’s particularly difficult to get the flywheel spinning on discussion forums because it relies on content OUTPUT and the whole world has shifted to content CONSUMPTION.<p>That being said, I’ll always have a desire to start, or be a part, of forums. I think they’re a beautiful interaction medium, and can be a great way to make friends, launch businesses, etc.')
