I ended up writing one, and now I&#x27;m using it for scripting in game engines :)<p>There are very few instructions for RV32I and RV64I - and you don&#x27;t have to support both. Just pick one and implement the basic instructions. Then compile a cross-compiler from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;riscv&#x2F;riscv-gnu-toolchain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;riscv&#x2F;riscv-gnu-toolchain</a> that is configured for either rv32i or rv64, like so:<p><pre><code>    .&#x2F;configure --prefix=$HOME&#x2F;riscv --with-arch=rv32i\n    make\n</code></pre>\nThe toolchain repo is pretty big so make sure you do a shallow clone.')
