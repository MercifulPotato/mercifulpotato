They told us to fly the airplane as the top priority, keep calm, think about the options and if the situation allows that, contact ATC and describe the problem with proper ATC prodecures. Of course it wouldn&#x27;t help to freak out and yell to the radio. I never heard about Yeager before. I am sure he was great Air Force officer and perfect test pilot but I am not sure about this unique communication specialty either. Pilots are expected to be calm, well-trained, know the ACFT limitations and emergency procedures.')
