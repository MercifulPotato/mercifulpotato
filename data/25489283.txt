It used to be that artists made most of their money from records.  They toured merely to create more fans that would buy their music.<p>Now it&#x27;s flipped 180 degrees.  Musicians make all their money from touring.  They release records to find new fans who will buy tickets to their shows.<p>We live in a golden era for the little guy.  Before the Internet if you didn&#x27;t own the means of production no matter how talented you might be you made money for those who did.<p>Now you can start a SaaS company and bootstrap your way into a living because the means of production have become ridiculously cheap.  A musician can release music on the Internet and go from a local following to a regional one and if they&#x27;re good enough a national one.<p>I well remember it taking Bob Seger ten years to go from a Detroit artist to a regional success and another ten years until he was &#x27;discovered&#x27; and overnight became a national one.  Bruce Springsteen did it faster because he was on the east coast and got a Time magazine cover.<p>The only difference now is that the young want success overnight and that is rare.  Are you committed enough to work for ten years or more to reach the level of finding a thousand fans?  Sometimes that means taking a lesser paying job to learn.  Or to have the time to code or play gigs on the weekend.  Thing about the Internet is you find your true talent level fairly quickly and you might not always like what you learn;&lt;).<p>Do you want to know Vine&#x27;s biggest problem?  They were owned by Twitter!  There is room for only one product to succeed there despite its best efforts to continually sabotage themselves.  FYI I do like Twitter.')
