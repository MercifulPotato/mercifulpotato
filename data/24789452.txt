Item(by='athenot', descendants=None, kids=[24789986], score=None, time=1602774942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24789193, text='I&#x27;m 2 decades into my career and have been working from home for a fortune 100 company for 2 years before covid (well, we would meet once a week in the office but just for meetings), so when the pandemic hit, it didn&#x27;t change our work habits.<p>A cheap Ikea desk is perfect for my needs. It&#x27;s a wood counter-top board and 2 adjustable sawhorses. Cost me about $200. However where I spent the money is on a good 5k monitor. With these 2 (and a saddle chair), I have everything I need for a workspace that is far more functional than an expensive modular furniture desk (ie. cubicle) with a low-res monitor.')
