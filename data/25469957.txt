I see why you don&#x27;t want mutated various versions of the same information all over the place, but you still have dangers.<p>Especially if you &quot;overly reduce&quot; your knowledge. If your common recipe is &quot;do A, B, C, D, E&quot; and you reduce that to just &quot;do X,&quot; for instance.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this often turn into &quot;now, instead of the knowledge being repeated in several places, it&#x27;s hidden in one place and only one person knows it.&quot; Everybody else just relies on the library doing its magic, and when someone needs to do something differently, they have this huge mountain to climb to figure out how to modify the code to also do &quot;J&quot; for certain cases without breaking everyone else.')
