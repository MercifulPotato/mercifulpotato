I won&#x27;t name them, because they were nice enough folks, and it&#x27;s not their fault that Google hates their customers.<p>The forums for the reseller were full of school IT folks trying to figure out how to provision hundreds of machines at a time. You can pay the reseller $15&#x2F;device to have them do it, but it adds and indeterminate delay in receiving your devices. Many of the staffers were talking about having in-service days where they brought in as many teachers and staff as they could get to do the provisioning part. Ridiculous.<p>I know a lot of people are upset about the changes that Apple is making to &quot;lock down&quot; Mac OS. However, in my opinion, the more Apple makes Mac OS locked down like Chrome OS, the better. Leave VMs as the &quot;escape valve&quot; for developers who need a CLI or POXIS apps. Parallels and VMware are a better, and more consistent experience than Mac OS anyway.<p>In an enterprise environment, Apple Business Manager volume purchasing hooked up with a device management solution like JAMF is just a no-brainer. The hardware is far more reliable, the purchasing and provisioning are dead simple, and there&#x27;s no third-party resellers unless you really want to work with one.<p>ed. Also, ChromeOS is still lacking critical productivity tools. Someday we&#x27;ll get there, but not just yet.')
