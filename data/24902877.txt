Item(by='charlesu', descendants=None, kids=[24903763], score=None, time=1603755741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900601, text='&gt; I believe it is illegal in california to consider race for public universities, so you could look at Caltech and Berkeley which fit most definitions of elite schools. Caltech is 48% Asian, while MIT is 25.7% for undergrad.<p>These are interesting stats but they don&#x27;t actually mean anything unless you can prove that the applicant pools for Caltech and Berkeley are similar to that of MIT. It&#x27;s entirely possible, that Caltech and Berkeley have a higher proportion of Asian applications. It&#x27;s also possible that underrepresented minorities that could be admitted to Caltech or Berkeley pick Harvard or Princeton because they&#x27;re more well-regarded and more diverse. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised. Elite schools compete for the same kids.')
