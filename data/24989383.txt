(Also, the UK had and still has a fairly large nuclear power fleet which generally runs full-out 24&#x2F;7, and this kind of demand shifting is a good match for that.) The trouble with renewables is that a lot of the drops in supply are both unpredictable and relatively long, which makes them hardre to deal with.<p>Also, storage heaters are a real pain to deal with. They&#x27;re inefficient and not very controllable in terms of the amount of heat they produce.')
