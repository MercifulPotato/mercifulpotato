I&#x27;ve mailed, through the US Post Office, my federal tax forms for the past few years as I don&#x27;t pay for software to file my taxes.  I have always gotten my tax refunds or other stimulus money directly deposited into my bank account by the IRS without any issues, including the past 2 stimulus payments.  I believe every time the government is using ACH transfers to do this.<p>Do most people in the US not do this when they file their taxes?<p>Do businesses not have the ability to do this like people do?<p>I mean, I know a lot of people in the US don&#x27;t have bank accounts, so the only way for the government to send them money is via a check in the mail.  This should (hopefully) be the exception and not the standard procedure.')
