I might have been one of them in the past. I&#x27;ll probably be one of them in the future when self-driving cars replace drivers. But for now...<p>Most of the drivers who don&#x27;t make enough money are bad at their job. California unions are encouraging these bad drivers to seek protection. I base this on talking to other drivers and taking rides myself. How is a driver bad at their job?<p><pre><code>  * won&#x27;t do rides out of town because &quot;I don&#x27;t get paid coming back&quot;\n  * won&#x27;t do rides to the airport\n  * declines short rides\n  * won&#x27;t get out of the car to help people put things or groceries in the trunk\n  * has a &quot;my car, my rules&quot; attitude. Won&#x27;t allow drinks for example\n  * won&#x27;t turn the radio down when someone gets a call\n  * male drivers bothering women who just want to get somewhere\n  * misses turns frequently\n  * talks whether the passenger wants it or not\n  * won&#x27;t talk if passenger clearly wants to talk\n  * takes eyes off the road while talking\n  * fiddles with their cell phone while driving to look at texts\n  * goes too fast, tailgates, lousy driver\n  * talks politics, religion or sex\n  * has a body odor problem. doesn&#x27;t use air freshener in car or shower before driving.\n  * has a dirty car\n  * won&#x27;t take a different route if asked, or alternately, goes off route without explanation\n  * won&#x27;t wait the require 5 minutes to pick someone up\n  * accepts a ride and then calls to see where they are going. cancels if they don&#x27;t like it (Lyft)\n  * won&#x27;t put on air conditioner when asked\n</code></pre>\nI could go on, but these drivers don&#x27;t get tips and don&#x27;t make enough money from rides because they are not maximizing potential. Up to 70% of drivers are like me and do a good job, like the freedom to work when and where they want, and would like you to vote yes on Prop 22 if you are in California.<p>Thanks')
