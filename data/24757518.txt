Item(by='ehnto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602526447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753523, text='&gt; The specific assertion regarding recruiters is that without any side-project that showcases your skills with specific technologies then recruiters have no objective way to evaluate your skills.<p>This is a tough argument to have constructively because it&#x27;s really going to depend on our own experiences at our jobs and in recruiting. But lets just say that I would have to work full-time on a side project for it to outshine my industry experience, which makes sense, because I worked full time in order to get that experience.<p>I guess that&#x27;s why this is a pain point for me. I see around me extremely skilled developers putting in real work solving real problems from 9-5, but according to the grandparent comment, their skills are suspect because they haven&#x27;t spent their afternoons writing dead end projects for fun.<p>I would hire any of them in a heartbeat over the guy with the New Tech laden github.')
