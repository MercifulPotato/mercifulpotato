It&#x27;s very different to your house. Zuckerberg and&#x2F;or you can make rules for your respective actual residence(s) all you want. You have &quot;editorial control&quot; and the associated liability over who comes to your home and what happens in it. facebook.com does not. You will be thrown in prison when somebody uses your kitchen to plan violent attacks, facebook (or Zuckerberg) is not thrown in prison when somebody uses a facebook group to do the same.<p>I also do not agree that corporations are people, in general.')
