They&#x27;re going to receive lease payments to service it.<p>If you were evaluating a bank that had $1tn in deposits and issued $800bn of home loans and had $200bn in cash, the $800bn figure of debt minus cash just doesn&#x27;t mean that much, and people don&#x27;t typically calculate EV for banks.<p>So say Tesla buys that bank - does their EV double to ~$2tn?<p>IMO, the only meaningful way to compare EVs is to unwind the financial divisions valuing them like financial companies, then compare what&#x27;s left.<p>It&#x27;s not all rosy, though, because even after unwinding financial services from these companies they&#x27;ve still got a lot of debt. And EVs do pose a risk that the value of the leased ICEs cars will plummet. If it happens very rapidly, that could well be an existential threat.')
