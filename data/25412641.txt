Info Security techniques have advanced as well, but again are often poorly or not at all implemented.<p>However, far too many organizations implement a &quot;Skittles&quot; type defensive posture rather than defense-in-depth posture.<p>There are a variety of reasons for this:<p>1.  Those responsible are ignorant of good security practice;<p>2.  Those responsible are aware of the risks, but ignore it as it negatively impacts profit;<p>3.  Those responsible are aware of the risks, but implement inadequate defenses because of the impact on  time-to-market and&#x2F;or profit.<p>4.  But the most egregious offenders are software developers, who often just bolt on weak security measures or just ignore security altogether, rather than design with security as a primary consideration.<p>There are other reasons, but those are the big ones, IMHO.')
