The goal being that a given distance in any direction anywhere in the volume have an equal perceptual difference to the eye, an aspect sorely missing from RGB (where eg 8bits&#x2F;channel is overkill in some colors but can result in banding in others, as well as being cumbersome to process in, as GP mentioned)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CIELAB_color_space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CIELAB_color_space</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Colour_banding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Colour_banding</a>')
