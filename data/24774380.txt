Diversification is the root of all evil and creates hidden oligopolies.\nIf the same investors own shares of all major corporations, then it creates a strong incentive for those corporations to collaborate with each other instead of competing.\nThis is probably why we ended up with companies like Google and Apple making employee non-poaching agreements with each other - There is enough shareholder overlap between the two companies that these illegal agreements benefit the majority shareholders of both companies.')
