I don&#x27;t know why I would want to trust such people. If they can&#x27;t even take a basic precaution during a <i>deadly pandemic</i> then their judgement seems dangerously impaired. I don&#x27;t trust them because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re trustworthy.<p>Even if masks didn&#x27;t work, stubborn refusal to wear them is nearly as bad- people should wear the even if they are skeptical on the effectiveness <i>just in case they do work</i>, because doing small things to possibly help your neighbors is part of the social contract.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about forcing people to wear masks, I&#x27;m talking about not trusting the people who don&#x27;t voluntarily wear masks.')
