Establishing identity is the problem.<p>Where I worked, there were a lot of phishing scams going out. Initially, they spoofed our email address, and DMARC helped stop that; but people would still respond to scams coming from webmaster@johnshouseofcontracting.example.org or whatever (lots of random website email forms turned into open relays). If you&#x27;re getting emails from publishing@randonnhouse or wi1ey or whatever lookalike domains, it&#x27;s going to be hard to tell, and verifying it came from the someone authorized by the domain owner doesn&#x27;t help.')
