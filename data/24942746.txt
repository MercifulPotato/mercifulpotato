Item(by='bhickey', descendants=None, kids=[24944731], score=None, time=1604069113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942296, text='TG removing his scores isn&#x27;t at issue. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a court that could order them to reinstate his scores, since it would be the government ordering them to engage in some speech. His claim is that TG called him a cheater.<p>For purposes of this ruling the judge found that TG&#x27;s statements were not opinion but were held out as fact. I think TG did themselves no favors in being cagey. They could&#x27;ve easily formulated their statement as an opinion based on disclosed facts. In essence, &quot;I think John is a drunk&quot; may be defamatory because it implies undisclosed facts while &quot;I think John is a drunk because he buys a liter of vodka each week&quot; is an opinion.')
