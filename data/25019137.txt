Item(by='emn13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604782077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018312, text='I don&#x27;t think anybody reasonably believed president Trump would have actually not relinquished power if he <i>formally</i> lost the election.  What he was accused of however, is <i>trying</i> to play nasty with votes, and <i>trying</i> to undermine the legitimacy of his loss.  To put it another way: it&#x27;s not that he wouldn&#x27;t transfer power, but rather that he&#x27;s willing to play dirty to <i>try</i> not to transfer power.<p>The reason why it was never realistic to believe he wouldn&#x27;t step aside is simply that he does not have the support to pull that off; it&#x27;s essentially a kind of civil war but one he (and any other president) would likely lose almost instantly - as long as it&#x27;s <i>clear</i> he lost the election.<p>And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so insidious to undermine the election, because that will eventually pave the way to <i>actually</i> ignore election outcomes.  Even today, I suspect in all the partisan posturing some voters may have come away with the honest impression that there really was a stolen election.  Since democracy hinges on <i>the losing side</i> accepting that loss, action that undermine that are quite problematic.<p>President Trump&#x27;s action so far, both before the election and after, are entirely in line with the accusations against him; in essence: he&#x27;s willing to undermine democracy to try and hold on to power.<p>Had the election been closer, it&#x27;s conceivable he might really have engineered some legal shenanigans to try and steal the election.  And if he had been backed in that (which isn&#x27;t entirely impossible, because some of the toss-up states have republican-appointed courts, republican legislatures, and republican governors, and of course the heavily tilted supreme court now), <i>then</i> things would have gotten dicey.  In that situation, just like in other strong-man democracies, the outcome of the election would have been rigged.  Would democrats have backed down?  Or would they have disputed the elections, even though formally they lost them?  That&#x27;s the kind of thing that breaks a democracy; because both backing down and confrontation are terrible outcomes.<p>To their credit - because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work in a democracy - those toss-up states did not seriously try to steal votes (although the vote-segregation thing is pretty close).  And of course we don&#x27;t <i>know</i> Trump would really have stolen the election, given the opportunity, since it never arose.  But we can see that he took all possible steps in that direction at least; and that&#x27;s something the US needs to deal with in the future for the sake of stability. It ended well this time; it might not every time.')
