Many email clients will cache your mail unencrypted on your disk as well.&quot;<p>Suppose myself and the recipient are using x509 certs with outlook and our laptops have encrypted disks with bitlocker or equivalent - my impression is that it mostly covers the basis, is that unjustified?<p>&quot;It&#x27;s actually better that people start to treat their mailboxes as somewhat ephemeral, as communicating that you are you encourages use of things like PGP signatures&quot;<p>Correct me if I misunderstood you, but I don&#x27;t think emails should be ephemeral. I am have currently several emails from my landlord, the police, etc. that I have to keep for years as evidence in case of a future dispute. While I cannot prove that they are not fake, it&#x27;s the same for physical letters, yet both are admissible in court as evidence. If I tried to get more reliable proof out of either of them, they might send me a hand-signed letter by post but they&#x27;d never figure out PGP.')
