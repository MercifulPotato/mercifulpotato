Nothing good will come of that.<p>That&#x27;s of course a matter of preference or ideology (and perhaps partly me being a European) but I do prefer government oversight over monopolies rather than unregulated wild west business areas - admitting it&#x27;s prone to failure, as both systems are. I do have issues with the US part of it, but we don&#x27;t have supranational regulatory bodies - perhaps something that we should work for, although it is very unlikely to happen successfully considering the ever diverging interests of the US, the EU and China.<p>&gt; They are currently pushing all the people I watch off YouTube, so wherever they go to I&#x27;ll follow.<p>Out of curiosity, who do you regularly watch that has been pushed off the platform?')
