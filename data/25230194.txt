Item(by='sandworm101', descendants=None, kids=[25230466, 25230768, 25230657], score=None, time=1606495497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227854, text='&gt;&gt;There&#x27;s a big question on whether these approaches work well for onboarding the next billion users to the internet<p>That isn&#x27;t what captchas are <i>used</i> for.  There are two side to every captcha, what the website is using them for and what <i>the captcha creator</i> or provider is using them for.  In google&#x27;s case, captchas are being used to hone AI.  So it is no wonder that items like hydrants, store fronts, crosswalks and traffic lights dominate.  Those are the objects that any AI-controlled vehicle will have to recognize.  Given that the first market for AI-driven vehicles seems to be western nations, specifically the US, it is no surprise that google gears its captcha program to objects from that area.<p>If google were developing robots to pick fruit captchas would ask us to identify bananas and oranges.  I worry about the day that captchas start asking me to differentiate people from other objects.  I don&#x27;t want to help train an AI to tell people from trees, soldiers from bushes.')
