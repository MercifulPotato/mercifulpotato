When it does, how we handle it is by being flexible and personally available about unbanning. That&#x27;s a luxury afforded by smallness.<p>In the more common case, though, it&#x27;s clear enough who&#x27;s doing it to take action. And you&#x27;d be surprised how often we get explicit confirmation of what happened. Sometimes a site owner will even passionately profess innocence and then sheepishly come back later with &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry, you were right, it turns out my marketing-person&#x2F;friend&#x2F;teammate did it.&quot;')
