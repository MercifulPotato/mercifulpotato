It&#x27;s fantastic, I use it all the time, sometimes randomly for stuff I haven&#x27;t got installed to find out whether I should homebrew it or not. Unlike man pages, tldr can search and find docs for stuff you don&#x27;t currently have installed.<p>And it&#x27;s fun to read. It&#x27;s how man pages should be written, at least have a tl;dr before boring you to death.')
