If you mean some art of abstract music or music that gets approved from some elite circle, I would indeed make the same arguments and don&#x27;t see a flaw.<p>My main point is that there is no objective comparison between thousand of pieces and when we take the choices of the elite circle and compare it to intersubjective choices of the masses there would be little to no overlapping. So my point would still be &quot;Why is your elite opinion more worth or correct than the collective opinion of the whole world?&quot;')
