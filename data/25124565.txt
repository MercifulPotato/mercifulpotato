That is an opinion you can have, and you can try to convince people of it; to be succesful at doing that, you probably want to understand what motivations and pressures lead to this style of use in the first place; why do you think so many (from my view, the majority of git users), choose to use git in this &quot;wrong&quot; way?<p>It still has nothing to do with <i>github</i> specifically. It is also true of people using gitlab. Before github existed, I (and many other teams I know) used a variety of other ways of hosting a remote git server shared by the team, including various open source software with web UI, as well as no web UI at all, remote git accessed via ssh (`ssh:` git urls) with no other UI.<p>The issue applies to all of them. And again most teams I knew were doing this before github existed. It applies to teams using gitlab or bitbucket or other in similar ways now too.<p>I still don&#x27;t thinkit makes sense to blame github specifically , as I believe you are doing, for the way most teams choose to use git -- since before github existed, and still now using a variety of software choices in addition to github.')
