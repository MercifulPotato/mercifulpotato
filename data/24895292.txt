It&#x27;s really hard to protect systems against malware if they make it easy to run arbitrary code. People paying $60 per year for antivirus software is a symptom of this.<p>Of course, Android malware exists too. But Google&#x27;s approval process, application sandboxing and the ability to remotely remove applications after they&#x27;re found to be malicious makes it a much smaller problem. It&#x27;s not something consumers cheer about, but rather something we mostly don&#x27;t think about when using phones and tablets.')
