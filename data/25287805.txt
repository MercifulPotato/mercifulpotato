Especially in HIV, Ebola maybe even some Cancer.\nBut I am very concerned by the push of those laboratories who could take the opportunity to put their technology on the market earlier than expected, especially when we removing some safeguard (at least for Europe who modified some regulation for them) And as well we can still use other &quot;traditional&quot; way like the inactivated virus already use since many years.<p>Big disclaimer: I am no virologist or even researcher. I am just a computer engineer.\nI am spending dozen of hours by week to get information around all of that stuff, trying to cross check every bit to avoid the rampant disinformation in our current days.\nWhat I said is my interpretation, It might be not totally accurate, hopefully, someone with better knowledge could correct my mistakes or approximation if there is any.\nIf you want to make your own point of view I can try to find all my sources I got when studying this subject.')
