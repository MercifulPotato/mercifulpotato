Jocko also had covered this book ad nauseum on his podcast.<p>I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re disagreeing on much other than you can&#x27;t have a field manual for <i>everything</i> which is where the commanders intent comes in. Yes, field manuals should align with the commanders intent just like standard procedures should align with a mission statement. But the commanders intent is there for the times when there isn&#x27;t clear guidance. Same goes, IMO, with a mission statement to align the values of a company. When a decision maker comes across a situation not explicitly covered by a standard procedure&#x2F;field manual, they need to ensure whatever decision they make aligns with the overall mission&#x2F;commanders intent.<p>If the leader &quot;has failed to sufficiently articulate his intentions&quot; that means there is no well-understood commanders intent. The leader has failed to articulate the why behind the mission. The same is true (as previously stated) for poorly formed mission statements. They don&#x27;t articulate the values of an organization in a meaningful way to guide decisions. If you are making the case that there should be clear tactical, detailed guidance provided on all scenarios, that is the opposite of decentralized command.<p>&gt;<i>Instead, those ethical decisions should include commandersâ€™s intent.</i><p>This goes without saying. That is exactly why I said it provides the framework for decision making.')
