I can honestly say they have changed my life for the better, with no side effects (other than an initial 3 days of tiredness, which wore off).<p>However, there are a few caveats:<p>I am convinced that the placebo effect is so powerful, that if you believe the meds will harm you, they actually could. I can&#x27;t back this up with science, but I think the only reason meds worked for me is because I was able to lose the negative preconceptions I had about them (same for therapy). Unfortunately, negative perception of antidepressants is so prevalent that this is very difficult (but doable).<p>Antidepressants shouldn&#x27;t make you feel numb. Neither are they &quot;happy pills&quot;. The goal of them is, in theory, to stop you feeling depressed _over nothing_. What they will hopefully do is bring you back to a stable normality, encompassing the entire range of normal human emotions.<p>Curing your depression will not automatically make you happy (but it will certainly help you on your way) â€“ Only living a happy and fulfilling life, full of people you care about and things you enjoy, can do that.<p>You also need to give your body the best chance, by making sure no basic aspect of your life is severely lacking - sleep, food&#x2F;drink, exercise, family&#x2F;friends&#x2F;social, hobbies that give you a feeling of accomplishment etc.')
