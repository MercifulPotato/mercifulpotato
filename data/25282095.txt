For example, the mythical 10x people among you will never have to worry about this, because they&#x27;re simply <i>that good</i>. Or if you happen to be working on rust for a year before it breaks into the mainstream, then you&#x27;ll have a head start for a while. But don&#x27;t expect that to last.<p>Overall: we will either realize and act on the fact that we are now for the most part a skilled labor like any other, or we will see our precious privileges erode and our incomes and work conditions deteriorate. And like it or not, but for many among us who are not &quot;the gift of god to coding&quot; the rational strategy will be to not fight on our own.<p>To bring this back to the current case: the NLRB decided that Spiers got illegally spied on. Whatever your take on her actions before that: illegal stays illegal, and as such don&#x27;t blame her for it &quot;because she had it coming.&quot; Blame google, for blatantly pushing against workers knowing and demanding their rights. If you see what they did here, and the context of this whole story, can you really take their argument at face value that she got fired for misappropriating company property or some such? Doesn&#x27;t it seem much more likely that they simply made an example of her for <i>informing</i> her co-workers of their rights?')
