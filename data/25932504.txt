Item(by='junippor', descendants=None, kids=[25939535], score=None, time=1611774825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922944, text='&gt;  I&#x27;d like to see a rewrite of EM in Geometric Algebra focused not on pages and pages of abstract equations, but practical numerical applications.<p>What do you mean by practical? Do you mean something you can use to calculate the electric and the magnetic fields as if we didn&#x27;t understand they&#x27;re the same thing? That exists, they&#x27;re described by their own fields of science which used to be called &quot;Electricity&quot; and &quot;Magnetism&quot; respectively. Of course, what&#x27;s the point when you have Maxwell&#x27;s equations?')
