Not to mention its tooling, which is better than any language I’ve used, full stop (a language is so much more than simply its syntax).<p>I believe that functional languages, with proper, fully-fledged type systems, are the best way to model computation. But if I had to write a resilient production system, I’m choosing Go any day.')
