It can only go downhill from there.<p>To me, car electronics should be like a Kindle is for reading. There is a period after you launch the Kindle but before you start reading where you interact with it like a smartphone or tablet. But then once you get started, the notion that you&#x27;re interacting with a digital device just disappears.<p>I want my car experience just like that - set up Spotify, Google Maps etc. before I go, then hands off any touchscreen until I stop. And I only use the audio driving instructions from Maps.<p>Come to think of it, the same applies to running - set up music, tracking app etc. on your front porch, don&#x27;t touch the screen again until you&#x27;re finished, that&#x27;s a sign of a good run.')
