Bandcamp cut its fees during the pandemic, and it kept some artists afloat for a while, but it wasn&#x27;t long after that when you saw the patreon crowdfunding model needed to prop things up.<p>Having DJ&#x27;d and been around a lot of musical talent in clubs throughout the last 14 years its clear most had to have day jobs in between gigs and supporting their own labels on top of living expenses. I doubt many had much or anything in savings and I fear with so many clubs and venues going under its going to take another generation of an underground rave scene to brings things back to what it was 10-15 years ago for many of the music scenes I still went out for. Which may be a good thing, but its still hard to see so many artists talent get wasted due to COVID.')
