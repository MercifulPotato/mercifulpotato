When it corrupted itself we copied it all back.  I liked sourcesafe.  It was kind of cool the way it worked and integrated into all the MS tooling we used at that time.  Plus it was decently cheap enough for a small inhouse group of devs to afford.  Its semantics for usage were very straightforward and easy to learn.  <i>BUT</i> it was a pain for how it would corrupt itself randomly.  That &#x27;one&#x27; bug is why no one dares use it today and hates the thing.  To this day because of how easy it was to use I compare the UX of all other source controls to it.')
