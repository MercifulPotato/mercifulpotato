Took a solid couple of minutes each machine pulling screws just to get the lid off so I could plug in a keyboard and monitor (Hercules Monochrome!) and assess the system.  Took a dozen machines and made four or five working ones - lot of hard drive failures though Spinrite did manage to resurrect a couple.  Still remember all those little jumper leads going from the peripheral cards through the ferrites and into the funky round connectors on the outside of the box.')
