I especially think that your points hold water if you were to feel the need to set out to build your community fork or competing hosted offering in the next couple of years. Secondarily, I think that if your company had the resources to staff developers to build out a whole hosted offering, I can tell you that CRL would love to be a partner and understand what&#x27;s going wrong. Maybe that&#x27;s unacceptable for some sort of other reason but it&#x27;s not obvious to me what that is. Yes the license means that real-time development of the project, on some level, relies on coordinating with its developers, which do, on the whole, work for a company.<p>All this being said, it sounds like you&#x27;ve got a better vision for how projects like this should get funded and built. How should society fund projects like CRDB? I think there&#x27;s a very wide range of reasonable answers that fall in different parts of the fantasy spectrum. For now, in 2020s American capitalism, the BSD license approach, at least to my tastes (which are hecka biased), feels pretty good.')
