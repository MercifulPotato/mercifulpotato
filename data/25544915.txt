Aluminum alloys readily liberate H2 from H20 at room temperarure (an exothermic reaction generating roughly equal parts thermal and chemical potential energy - both of which of course can be used for work) [1].<p>The oxidized aluminum is environmentally benign and can be recycled by applying more energy to deoxydize the product. The &#x27;purification&#x27; process is ultimately where the useful energy comes from. The energy to power the purification can come from any number of sources - but as good stewards, we opt for clean energy sources. Al smelting historically produced a lot of carbon, but thanks to R&amp;D by Apple, there are new carbon-free alternatives for this process [2].<p>At my company we are researching application of this energy infrastructure loop for powering ships (where source water is abundant). Essentalially, the Al+ is your fuel (battery), and from a volumetric energy density perspective (important for ships), you can store about 2X as much as gasoline&#x2F;diesel - and way better than liquified or compressed H2 storage. However, on a mass energy density perspective (important for automobiles), it is a bit worse (heavier) than hydrocarbon fuels. Again though, each application has it&#x27;s own constraints when considering an energy storage medium.<p>The automotive or civil sectors aren&#x27;t the only use-cases for hydrogen fuel cells. One needs to take a look at all sectors to really grasp the global impact. A large part of my job is to explore this big-picutre aspect, because we need to understand the long term infrastructure stability&#x2F;availability of potential &quot;clean&quot; energy supply chains, and it&#x27;s VERY complex when you consider process efficiencies over the entire supply chain, raw material abundance and regeneration potential&#x2F;economics&#x2F;environmental impacts&#x2F;speed, geopolitical forces affecting supply chains, the list goes on and on (and on).<p>H2 is an interesting &quot;energy storage&quot; option and it will certainly continue to be researched and applied broadly.<p>1.
