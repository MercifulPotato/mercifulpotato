I can&#x27;t exactly pull out too many pitch forks because CentOS did let me enjoy some of their packaging labor for free.<p>It&#x27;s obvious in retrospect that their intention was to pull this when they acquired the CentOS project - plotting to turn CentOS into a RHEL on-ramp while dressing it as an embrace of the community feels like a kick in the groin.<p>Also, 16 servers is barely enough for tech companies caught by this, and is less of a good will gesture, and more subscription growth hacking.')
