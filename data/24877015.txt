Canada&#x27;s senate does not use proportional representation either - that avoids the country being run by Ontario and Quebec at the expense of the other 8 provinces and 3 territories.<p>The designs you argue against were <i>specifically</i> implemented to provide a system of checks and balances to avoid a simply majority from unchecked rule.  And this is doubly true in the US, where it&#x27;s a &quot;union of states&quot;, not just one massive country.  A lot of those rules were put into place <i>in order to get the states to join the US</i> because otherwise they would have had zero say in the affairs of the country.<p>Those checks you want to remove are not a bug but a feature.')
