And it lets anybody select a set of accounts and get a time-ordered list of what they&#x27;ve published. That&#x27;s how I use it. I follow a couple thousand interesting people, ones who tend to point to other interesting people and articles. If at any point I&#x27;m bored, I can drink from a firehose of good content.<p>I also maintain a feed reader, which is how I follow people who have their own sites. But I don&#x27;t need to use those sites for discovery, the pattern you describe in the old days. Discovery just isn&#x27;t a problem I have much. These days, my problem is filtering down to what I actually have time to read.')
