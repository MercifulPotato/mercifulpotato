Stock trades don&#x27;t settle until T+2, so any new purchases using those proceeds are done on margin.<p>TBH, that, for me, is the real scandal here. We have such an antiquated system that we <i>can&#x27;t actually be confident</i> who owns the stock at any point until you do some super-slow settlement process that takes two days[2]. And so, enshrined in law, we have this bolted-on system where you have to put up extra collateral just to be confident of something that shouldn&#x27;t need said collateral.<p>There is no reason, with all the identities attached, and auditing procedures, and digital signing, and protocols we have today, that we shouldn&#x27;t be able to <i>know</i> who owns the stock at any given point, and not have to rely on these super-slow resolutions.<p>In this case, they had to add that collateral, even when buying with money that pretty obviously was there (had been deposited years ago).<p>Plus, some articles are claiming[1] that even stock you do own, whose purchase long ago settled, is being lent out without your direct knowledge by the broker for a profit, which is like ... what?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yudkowsky.medium.com&#x2F;r-wallstreetbets-is-trying-something-unprecedented-in-history-and-the-medias-not-reporting-it-7ab507e4a038" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yudkowsky.medium.com&#x2F;r-wallstreetbets-is-trying-some...</a><p>[2] Incidentally, people like to ridicule Bitcoin for taking an hour to settle since you have to wait an hour to get six confirmations. But that&#x27;s actually fast compared to this (centralized!) system, since you have to compare to the time after which you can &quot;take the stock&#x2F;cash and run&quot;.')
