It often makes things clearer to think in those terms.<p>However, I think the 100, 1k, 100M approach might have drawbacks to finding the _best_ solution because the final iteration carries forward assumptions from the previous iterations. In CS terms, we may arrive at a local maximum this way, instead of the global max.')
