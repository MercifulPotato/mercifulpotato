Nerds aren&#x27;t unpopular because they&#x27;re too smart for school and all the athletic jocks envy them, they&#x27;re unpopular because they act like nerds. That&#x27;s not a passive thing happening to someone, it&#x27;s something that people actively act like.<p>Obviously one can be highly intelligent in school and not be nerdy, everyone knows people who are intelligent as well as popular have a healthy social life.<p>Nerds never did well in school because they&#x27;re often smug as hell, think they&#x27;re the brainy protagonist of some sort of TV show envied by everyone else, but in reality not even that clever. That&#x27;s a bad combination. The nerds are no different than the goth kids, or the punks, or anyone else who conjures up an identity in high school to declare themselves the moral centre of the universe. It&#x27;s unpopular because it&#x27;s immature.')
