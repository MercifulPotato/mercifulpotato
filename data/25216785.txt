One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that people forget that the original claim of the study stands: if the only interesting option is the addictive stimulant, the rats keep going back.  The other claim that there&#x27;s pernicious effects to a utopia is in addition to the other, and both claims I regard as equally instructive to how one would think about incentives in society, that goes beyond rats.<p>Another edit:  A better example of a fraudulent study would be the Stanford Prison Experiment.  I don&#x27;t disagree that bad faith and misguided research is a big problem is social psychology.  But I think the problem is more visible in the field now, and hopefully being addressed.  &#x27;Behavioural biology&#x27; probably holds more promise in the longer term.')
