What we have now (sites can moderate as they see fit)<p>3. Some external board adjudicates on what it is acceptable to moderate<p>Of these, 3 seems by far the worst, and 2 seems better than 1 on empirical grounds.<p>&gt; OTOH, if NY Times publishes an OP Ed that slanders and doxes me, causes me to lose my job, etc. then I have the legal right to sue them.<p>You also have the legal right to sue Google if they publish content that slanders you. You can even sue them for doxxing you. You wouldn&#x27;t win either one. Nor would you win if you sued the NYT for doxxing you, or if an NYT article caused you to lose your job. Keep in mind that &quot;the covington kid&quot; didn&#x27;t actually win any lawsuits, he sued a bunch of people for ridiculous amounts and settled out of court for, likely, a relatively trivial sum. It might have paid for his college, and that was mostly &quot;make it go away&quot; money. He&#x27;s the free speech equivalent of a patent troll.')
