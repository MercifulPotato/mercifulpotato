The animals suffer, display behavioural disorders and often won&#x27;t procreate.<p>Just ask any zoo how difficult it is to get certain animals to breed in captivity - with some it&#x27;s even thought to be impossible (cheetahs are a prominent example).<p>So please, for love of Zeus stop with the &quot;Mouse Utopia&quot; already!')
