From time to time, the Wifi doesn&#x27;t come back up after resume (particularly when I&#x27;ve let it in sleep overnight, or switches networks while sleeping) and I have to reboot. As the machine boots in less than 12 seconds that&#x27;s a tolerable annoyance though.<p>The machine is Ryzen5&#x2F;Vega so it requires no proprietary driver though it isn&#x27;t Linux certified at all. The only piece of non-working hardware is the fingerprint reader (apparently a driver will come someday...).')
