In the Middle Ages “property rights” were thought to reside ultimately in the King or the sovereign.<p>No, the sovereign <i>owned</i> the property (i.e. had allodial title) and rights to its use were granted in fealty. These rights were not ownership rights, which is probably what the author meant by &quot;not real property rights&quot;, and the King could &quot;trample&quot; these rights because <i>he owned the property</i>.<p>&gt; Tort law makes no sense without property rights. If you do not own yourself or some property how can you claim to have been harmed.<p>Huh? This begs the question. We can recognize other sorts of rights, like the right not to be physically harmed. &quot;Ownership&quot; is unnecessary, and the argument is circular.<p>&gt; You cannot buy a farm and then build a house next to your neighbor’s pig sty and then sue them for nuisance.<p>Actually, you can, and you may win. You might have to pay them to move their pig farm, but you can win. This is almost exactly what happened in <i>Spur Industries. v. Del E. Webb</i> involving the building of Sun City, Arizona.
