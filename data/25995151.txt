Or in 12months? Making promises that rely on future people to fulfil them single handed is the same as doing nothing, just with better PR.<p>Second, I&#x27;m really unconvinced electricity can reasonably fulfil the same jobs currently done by gas. I don&#x27;t think you can run a boiler with the same power. If you do somehow build such a boiler affordably you&#x27;ll have big issues surge capacity and supply levels.')
