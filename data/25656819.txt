The entire content of this comment is: I read a bunch of stuff somewhere that said all these alternative companies are bad.<p>There are no links to sources, there&#x27;s no evidence presented, there&#x27;s nothing to dispute. There&#x27;s no substance to this comment.<p>Hacker News has a bias towards Google because Google offers a bunch of services for free that are useful to HN&#x27;s audience, so HN users would rather not have reasons <i>not</i> to use Google services, which is why comments like this get upvoted, despite their lack of substance.')
