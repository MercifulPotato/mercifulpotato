There are a couple of series that went down that path, such as Soldier of Fortune, but most of them don&#x27;t feature anything beyond blood and &quot;rag doll&quot; physics.<p>The stories of most of these games are close to a hero fantasy. Having the people you shot scream in terrible agony as their organs fell out wouldn&#x27;t exactly work with that theme.')
