Of course, that has all sorts of other problems that make it worse (so much worse).<p>Once you learn how to slow down the earlier bits, you end up with all the bits arriving at the same time, and you can have up to n adds pipelined and timed to the clock when output matters.<p>But with NN I think now would be a fun time (and likely the last decade as well) to rethink the basics right down to the basics. Everything need not be a NAND gate. :)')
