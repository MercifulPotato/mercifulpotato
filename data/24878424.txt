A mere 128k to 256k bump in memory spec on a microcontroller will send you back a $1.20 in chip price.<p>To be fair, the esp* chips don&#x27;t have memory mapped on-chip flash but load the code from external SPI flash to RAM at startup.<p>While that solution is cheaper (and also faster due to executing from RAM) it adds a small delay at startup powering the large RAM uses more energy.')
