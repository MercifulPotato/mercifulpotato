I am sure that this library simulator will be very helpful to people unable to visit a library or unable to read standard print.<p>I personally have a print-related disability, known as severe convergence insufficiency. Because of this, my neuro-ophthalmologist filled out paperwork certifying that I have a print-related disability, and I have access to the National Library Service, through the US Library of Congress.
