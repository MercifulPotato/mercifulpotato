Get a Series 7, and go nuts. You&#x27;ll probably have to spend some time apprenticing at a financial firm, but that seems like a reasonable hurdle if your goal is to become a professional investor.<p>I still feel like the &quot;classism&quot; argument here is extremely weak. Not because investment opportunities aren&#x27;t classist --- they are --- but changing 501(a) isn&#x27;t going to fix that. They&#x27;re <i>structurally</i> classist. Good bets don&#x27;t want retail money, because retail investors are, as a cohort, a bunch of loons. It might never occur to you to sue over some random, mundane options allocation event, but I promise you, it would occur to someone in the cohort of retail investors.<p>I really believe that retail investors do not have a functioning mental model of how startup investing works. It&#x27;s hard enough to get people to diversify at all. To invest in startups, you have to place 10 bets, hoping that 1-2 winners pay for all the losers. Ordinary investors <i>freak the fuck out</i> when one of their positions goes to zero, which is the expected outcome in private company investment.')
