Because of expensive rewards programs given to the consumers who use the card.  Why are there expensive rewards programs?  Because consumers like them! And they insist on paying with a credit card because of them. Except in edge cases, merchants have no choice but to accept credit cards despite the cost.<p>While Visa, Mastercard &amp; Amex frequently get the blame, the lions share of the processing fee flows to the issuing bank of the card, and the lions share of that fee goes to fund rewards programs.  (There are other perks to credit cards that encourage consumer usage, including chargeback protections, free 30 days of float, near universal acceptance, etc)<p>Payment costs won&#x27;t materially decrease unless someone invents a form of payment that consumers prefer which doesn&#x27;t have these cost burdens.  Or if you, as the merchant, have such market power that you can mandate a less preferred but cheaper form of payment (like cash or debit card or ACH - this is why you often can&#x27;t use your credit card to pay a parking ticket or your taxes)')
