Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605900577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163327, text='&gt; I think a pervasive theme in US infrastructure (and why it&#x27;s expensive) is that we&#x27;ve gotten out of practice of building. I think it&#x27;s the deeper &quot;why&quot; to this issue.<p>When it comes to nuclear, that&#x27;s a problem the world over. Out of practice of designing as well. Look no further than the mess that is the EPR. On its face it seems like a boondoggle, but it makes a lot more sense when you look back at the history of nuclear construction: from 1971 to 1993, France was continuously building plants, first the 34 900MW CP-series (1971 to 1988) then the 20 1300MW P-series (1978 to 1993). The CP-series took 5-6 years to build and the P-series a bit more (6-7). From the mid-70s to the mid 80s, there were a dozen plans being built at any time, and they were being completed.<p>Then came the N4, that thing had serious teething issues, the first model started construction in 1985 but took <i>12 years</i> to complete. By the time the 4th was completed, it was down to 7 years. But the 4th was the last N4 to be built. It&#x27;s unclear to me whether the N4 slowdown was intended all along or whether the teething issues made them take a look at construction and pump the brakes, but in the space of 5 years the country went from building 12 plants at a time to building 5, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.<p>N4 at least overlapped some with the tail end of the CP-series and the middle of the P-series, but the first EPR construction was started in 2007, 5 years after the last N4 (Civaux 2) was <i>completed</i>. I can&#x27;t even imagine the loss in institutional knowledge over that span.')
