We considered each other to be at each others&#x27; level. He&#x27;s a junior pentester now :)<p>I think he did find that his OSCP helped for recruiters. We both don&#x27;t know anything about CompTia Pentest+<p>------\nI got a reaction from my friend.<p>Based on his impression about CompTia Pentest+: it depends on what cert is valued. In The Netherlands OSCP and CEH are the most well-known. CompTia Pentest+ looks most like CEH in terms of design and exam format (based on his quick glance of the curriculum). Take a certificate that recruiters actually look for, because <i>that</i> does help.<p>Even if the certificate doesn&#x27;t match the job that you&#x27;re doing, it shows a lot of dedication. For example, the network skills that my friend learned at OSCP (and while we were training) are almost not needed for the web pentesting that he does.<p>He also says that his company feels less hesistant to hire someone with OSCP compared to CEH. OSCP is quite hardcore compared to CEH.')
