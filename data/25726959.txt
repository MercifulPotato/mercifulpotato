When I&#x27;m out walking I can often hop around the wide of the grid or climb the fence but not always. I never enjoy traversing a cattle grid.<p>The obvious alternative is a gate. But it&#x27;s been established now that motorists never have to leave their cars to open gates etc. on the public highway so I can&#x27;t see that happening (although it does exist in some rare level crossings, for example). Also they probably can&#x27;t be trusted to close the gate behind them.')
