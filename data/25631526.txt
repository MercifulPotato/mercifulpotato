You go to investigate it, which, of course, take some time. You realize that the fact has a normal explanation but, when you go back to conversation of the CT, that&#x27;s not a relevant fact in the conversation anymore. There is a new fact, or more, supporting the CT. Start the process again. It&#x27;s impossible to catch with the fact that it&#x27;s, at the moment, supporting the CT.<p>I think, this is different from the old way conspiracy theories, where people just believed highly improbable things.<p>It also makes it more appealing to more people, because, if you take it all globally and don&#x27;t look carefully, it really looks like there is a lot of evidence.')
