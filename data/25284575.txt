I haven&#x27;t seen anyone refute this.<p>More than one union exists in the world, they also compete with each other to offer their members the largest benefits. I donâ€™t see why unionisation would reduce pay competition, if anything it should increase it by ensuring that anti-poaching agreements never happen.')
