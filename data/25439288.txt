If you&#x27;ve decided to override OS APIs and do your own ground up implementation, then you basically need to do everything an OS-level API would do if it was behaving correctly. So you either need to parse all the appropriate system files (hosts, nsswitch.conf, etc.) with the appropriate special handling of localhost domains, or have your own equivalent, app specific configuration.<p>The “what are you supposed to do?” complaint seems to be complaining that replacing the core OS-level name resolution facility to avoid the possibility that it doesn&#x27;t comply with one spec recommendation while avoiding loss of other desirable features involves quite bit of complexity. Which, yeah, it does. The whole reason to have OS level services like that is to <i>prevent</i> every app that does networking from having to reimplement basic services.')
