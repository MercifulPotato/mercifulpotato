Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena[4] and human activities.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pareto_distribution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pareto_distribution</a>')
