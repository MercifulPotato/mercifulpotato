It&#x27;s a few clicks in the Fedora installer or a few commands with Arch Linux. It comes out of the box on new MacBooks and most new Windows laptops (although the more secure BitLocker option requires Windows 10 Pro).<p>Directory-level encryption is harder to set up and useâ€”it requires typing your passphrase more often and makes you choose third-party software instead of using the features built into your operating system. Plus, lots of important files, like your browser&#x27;s autofill information and other files that aren&#x27;t considered &quot;critical&quot;, are left wide open.<p>Encrypting your home directory is better than encrypting the &quot;TOP SECRET&quot; directory, but it&#x27;s still just as hard as setting up full-disk encryption while being less effective.')
