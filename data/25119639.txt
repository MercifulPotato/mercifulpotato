Light fan, audible but not too bad. Power consumed probably around 15W, but we&#x27;ll have to wait for serious measurement.<p>For MBA (no fan. passive cooling) same ST number, MT number is 6300. So fall off, but not that bad, large cores at maybe 80% of peak. Device gets slightly warm, not hot, under this use case. Device power maybe 8..9 W I would guess?')
