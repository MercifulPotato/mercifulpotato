That’s what leads to breakthroughs and new things. Constraints often breed innovation. What is the incentive to sink billions into R&amp;D if someone can sit on the sidelines and just take what you have developed? Look at the situation right now: we have multiple vaccine candidates from multiple companies because they all had significant incentive to develop them not because they were necessarily going to make a lot of money off this particular vaccine, but because they could accelerate R&amp;D on tech they can use for other therapies. Some of these vaccine candidates  appear to be mediocre at best. If we didn’t have a competitive marketplace we wouldn’t have gotten the best vaccine possible in the shortest timeframe possible.')
