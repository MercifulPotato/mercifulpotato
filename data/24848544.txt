These surgeries fixed most of my issues but for the last couple of years I haven&#x27;t tolerated sitting well because of my back so I use a standing desk. I&#x27;ve thought about a computer interface that is the opposite of this article. Something that requires more non-repetitive physical movement so that you&#x27;re exercising while you program.
