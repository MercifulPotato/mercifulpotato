It&#x27;s more complex than that, one has denser logic while the other has denser SRAM and what have you, but it&#x27;s a good baseline.<p>Since Intel is struggling with 10nm but is shipping, that puts TSMC about a node and a half ahead.<p>If you want to dig in deeper, wikichip has most of the public specifics on the process nodes (which are heavily shrouded in secrecy).
