One is that the traffic to this client is heavily driven by ad spend, and the site fell on it&#x27;s face hard this past year any time a big spike got sent our way by a single or combination of ad vendors (which we can&#x27;t really control in fine enough detail) -- facebook, by the way, is by far the worst about this. They can and will cause a thundering herd.<p>The second reason is that there&#x27;s a bunch of scale up&#x2F;down to services in AWS if you&#x27;re doing it right. You&#x27;re not buying a .16xlarge server in AWS to host your ecommerce site, that would be stupid, you don&#x27;t need that 24x7. You&#x27;re paying for a pair of .xlarge servers at a Reserved Instance rate, which is half the published rate. When you need to, your instance count (and your aws bill) goes up.<p>We couldn&#x27;t do that at the VPS host we were on, so we kicked them to the curb. With AWS, we can handle the load spikes -AND- the total lower bill for a year came out much lower.')
