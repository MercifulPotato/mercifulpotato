As an extreme example, suppose a company distributed 4 versions of a document to employees, each printed in red, blue, green, or black ink (a variant of steganography). Even though you&#x27;ve taken a crap photo, you still have the color in evidence, and they know which subset of the employee pool the leak came from.<p>Any number of techniques like this could be used, such that you can&#x27;t be sure the &quot;watermark&quot; is gone without making the document functionally useless - especially if you don&#x27;t know what the watermark is. e.g. maybe you take a black and white photo of the document above, but they also changed some of the wording on the page in each version.<p>+1 to my sibling comment&#x27;s point about how each digital device you use to cover your trail will do its best to leave a new trail.')
