Item(by='sfteus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605978221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169562, text='From my experience, w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t meetings, I&#x27;ve worked from home going on 6 years now. A few years back we were acquired by a large company that had several divisions that worked entirely in office. When everyone started working from home, those divisions would initiate meetings significantly more often. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s like a subconscious desire for more human interaction for those people that would usually get a bunch throughout the day, or a need to micromanage from some people, or just them thinking that they needed extra communication to make up for the remote working, but it was significantly jarring on our team for the first few months until everyone else sort of found their groove.<p>That&#x27;s counter to our team, where we basically have the &quot;policy&quot; of less disruptions is better. Any discussion item is pushed into an e-mail or chat unless absolutely necessary. If there are items that are deemed to need a voice meeting that are remotely similar then we&#x27;ll move them up or push them back to combine them to reduce the need to be on a call. 99% of our communication is done via e-mail or a group chat room, and the expectation is that an e-mail can go without a response for 24 hours, and a chat room message can go without a response for at least 1 hour. Anything urgent goes through a direct message, and the expectation is that you check the receivers status to make sure they&#x27;re aren&#x27;t in a &quot;do-not-disturb&quot; status before hand. Only time that is ignored is if something mission critical is occurring, like a systems outage. When you can limit 99% of your distractions to something you can check real quick once every hour or so, your productivity goes way up.<p>I can also say from experience that having your own space, and good equipment, is severely overlooked by people. I used to work entirely in my office, but we rescued a Belgian Malinois a few months before the lockdowns started so I had been working from a chair in my living room since the office is where our cats hang out for most of the day, and I wanted to give them time to adjust to the puppy as well. Even outside of the new puppy distraction, it&#x27;s really easy to just sink into your &quot;comfort&quot; area and get distracted or stop working. Once she was housebroken, I started working out of our dining room instead so I could keep an eye on her but still not invade the office until she was better trained, and I noticed a significant productivity boost. GCP Grey has a great video on this (&quot;Lockdown Productivity: Spaceship You&quot;), and the idea is that even though the dining room isn&#x27;t a dedicated office, it&#x27;s still a place that you don&#x27;t subconsciously associate with relaxing, so you still treat it like an office.<p>I don&#x27;t have kids or a work from home spouse, so I don&#x27;t have any advice there.')
