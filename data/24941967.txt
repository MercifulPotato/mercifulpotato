CNAs and nurses are very well compensated at my hospital -- however, we are a regional hospital for a fairly rural area, so it&#x27;s hard to attract talent. The majority of our staff has a 30 minute drive to get to work - if it&#x27;s any further than that, they&#x27;ll tend to go to the large city in the opposite direction and get a job there for less money but more amenities. Finding nurses and CNAs that are passionate about geriatric and particularly dementia care is difficult in the best of circumstances.')
