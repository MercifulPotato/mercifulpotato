You basically take off and land once you hit commercial.<p>I get the learning part - the first time you learn how redundant and simple Cessna engines are, the first time you realize how light and simple it really is, how to tie it down, your first time trying to fly with instruments only, your first crosswind landing, etc. But after that? Really seems like &quot;just a job&quot;.<p>Btw, not a pilot in any sense, just took some very discounted classes.')
