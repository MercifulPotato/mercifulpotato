I suspect you could too. We all can, none of this is a secret.<p>Soâ€¦is Amazon a node in the political decision making apparatus if you can ignore them entirely and still predict their behavior? I would argue that is strong evidence Amazon is <i>not</i> a decision node when it comes to political decision making, they are a follower node. I would argue that <i>all</i> mainstream US businesses are follower nodes.<p>Non-political business questions? Sure. I agree US businesses like Amazon are mostly free to act independently. Shutting down Parler, though, was a political decision. An expression of power. In that realm, Amazon was not the one in charge.')
