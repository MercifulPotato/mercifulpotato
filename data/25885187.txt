Of course eventually that product and team morphed into Eclipse.<p>I was lucky enough to play as small part as a college-age intern working at an Object Technology International [2] Lab in Sydney.<p>I soaked in the pair programming, watching the screen flash by. I read every book they gave me (e.g. The Toyota Way, this was before XP &#x2F; Agile books existed). I was amazed they actually paid me to work on these problems. I was so proud to make contributions and still remember fondly the hand-drawn diagram of the architecture passed down like a relic through the team. I am still inspired by their passion and commitment to delivery.<p>I definitely would not be the person I am today without the career defining experience working for Adrian Cho [3] and Dave Thomas [4] during that time. Periods like that are rare in a career - grab them if you can!<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulhammant.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;smalltalk-envy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulhammant.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;01&#x2F;smalltalk-envy&#x2F;</a>\n2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Object_Technology_International" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Object_Technology_Internationa...</a>\n3 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adriancho.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adriancho.com&#x2F;</a>\n4 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davethomas.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davethomas.net&#x2F;</a>')
