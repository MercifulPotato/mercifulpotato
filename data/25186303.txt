If we include everything required to develop a vaccine, I&#x27;d imagine we&#x27;re looking at something north of 2.5bn<p>There&#x27;s so many ways to calculate the cost, that I think it&#x27;s more important to be aware of the assumptions made for the estimate, than the number itself (which I also failed to do in my original answer)<p>I think people underestimate the cost of drug development, because the numbers are so big, that it doesn&#x27;t seem realistic for companies to survive')
