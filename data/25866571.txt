You would think that some of the grocery suppliers would get wise to the fact that these customer bases need drastically different experiences.<p>A consumer grocery shopper wants like with like (including in multiple locations. e.g. I want chili powder in the spice aisle, and with the mexican food), lots of variety, things organized by price. etc...<p>A food order picker wants something that looks like an ikea warehouse. Pick items x,y,z from bins a,b,c in aisle 3. They could probably care less if like is with like, as long as there is an easy way to find substitutes. They want to work with a bunch of people that are &#x27;on a mission&#x27; like they are. And not have to deal with people like me who read the marketing copy on each type of Newman&#x27;s pasta sauce.')
