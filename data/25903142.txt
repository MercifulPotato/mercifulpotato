Item(by='newscracker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611583187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25900575, text='&gt; &quot;Our phones already read our faces, and our faces are already all over the internet, so I don&#x27;t think it really makes much of a difference [to someone&#x27;s security].”<p>That’s exactly why it’s a problem. The phones, at least the good ones, have better security and store the face map securely and allow it to be used for specific purposes in a secure manner. The faces being all over the Internet is also the problem why such systems are susceptible to attacks.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s faster, more convenient, and safer... and you don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving your phone or cards at home.&quot;<p>It may be convenient. It may be fast. But it’s certainly not safer.<p>I worry that this will become the future, where users might as well have a permanent tattoo on their foreheads saying “Please rob me”. I also wonder who’ll bear the time and money lost due to fraud and theft. “Someone stole your face, please change it” doesn’t sound like a solution.')
