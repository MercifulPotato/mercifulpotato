Plaid can be used to verify banking details (many stock brokers use it for this, for example).<p>Plaid works by asking the user to give their banking username and password to Plaid, and then their two factor authentication token too. Plaid logs into their account behind the scenes to verify ownership.<p>Plaid claims to not store this info, and I assume that they don&#x27;t, but it still seems like one of the biggest security anti-patterns ever. If nothing else, it&#x27;s training users to ignore the &quot;don&#x27;t share your password&quot; warnings. Do we really want users trained to be more susceptible to phishing?')
