I find it helpful to remember that imagery when looking at the ingredients of something I’m about to eat - would I want to shovel a tablespoon of sugar (or more) in my mouth right now? The thought tends to dissuade me and I have become a little more conscious of my sugar intake that way. It’s shocking how much sugar is in the processed “food” we buy. A 16oz strawberry açaí refresher from Starbucks has 32 grams of sugar. :P')
