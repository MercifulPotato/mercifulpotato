Item(by='hakfoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609452797, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590846, text='What I don&#x27;t like about Jira is that eventually everything ends up in a poorly structured pool of &quot;Work complete&quot; tasks.<p>I regularly come across situations of the form &quot;we finished Task XYZ a few months ago, but I want to come back to it.&quot;  Maybe the ticket has an attachment we need for long-term documentation purposes or a test detail we need the next time we review the code.<p>Jira search rarely finds anything useful-- the S&#x2F;N ratio is terrible with non-development tasks mentioning XYZ, yet ignoring actual XYZ tasks due to poor naming and heirarchy.  I usually instead look at the code itself, see in the git history &quot;This was modified in ticket 345675&quot; and then use that to index Jira back to the info I want.  From there maybe I can walk between linked blockers and sub-tasks to get what I want.<p>My pre-Jira experience was on Basecamp v1&#x2F;v2.  I appreciated the forum-style layout, because it tends to allow for a few key things:\n* &quot;Search&quot; and &quot;browse&quot; are both well supported use cases\n* Old content remains usable and structured, rather than dropping off a cliff after the last ticket closed.\n* Content can be grouped as it makes sense-- say you get a customer feedback item that touches on three eventual tasks.  It would have to be (possibly sliced up and) attached to all three tickets in a Jira model.\n* It felt &quot;discussion-first&quot;-- the discussion of what to do and how we want to do it is central.  This tends to archive some of the subtle choices and gotchas that won&#x27;t appear automatically in a ticket.<p>I always dreamed of a system that basically added lightweight ticket&#x2F;kanban model on top of Basecamp.  I can see the value of tickets as a trackable unit of work, but it feels like this would be little more than a few tiny tags decorating a readable discussion flow.')
