When you get into stuff as far from everyday life as electrons, our intuitive definitions don&#x27;t work very well.<p>Most scientists, I think, use some definitions along the lines of &quot;Reality is whatever appears in our best models&#x2F;explanations of our observations of the world&quot;.<p>If all observations of electrons we have ever made obey some law, we say that&#x27;s the real behaviour of electrons. If we find out it doesn&#x27;t always work, we realize reality is something more complex, and at some point hopefully we find out what it is.')
