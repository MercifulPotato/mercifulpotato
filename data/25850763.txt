People would opt-in to the email and select the frequency from a form on my personal website, and on my end I would get a reminder to send out my weekly update. It ended up being a bit buggy and a hassle to manage, and I&#x27;m planning to rewrite it soon. I bet if you built this feature into the app, you could organically grow the user base, as users would be able to still send Sunday reflections to certain emails and that email could have a link to download the app.<p>I think the audience for an app like this is people like me, who want to free themselves from social media altogether. I&#x27;m thrilled to see people working on the dopamine addiction that Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc feed on, and wish you the best of luck on this venture!<p>Also, if you&#x27;re looking for some free serverless code to power  the idea I mentioned above, let me know how I should get that to you.')
