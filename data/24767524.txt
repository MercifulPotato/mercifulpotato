If you really have a problem with &quot;very high&quot;, we can agree on &quot;high&quot;. But we do agree that (a) this is not just an accident but caused by a real-world cause, (b) that real-world cause is Covid-19, and (c) the spike could have been avoided or at least flattened. Yes?<p>&gt; good, you are part of the group I wanted to reach.<p>If you really want to reach us, a good way would be to tell us what you really want to tell us. If what you want to tell us is that Sweden did everything right at all times, you&#x27;ll have to argue a bit more explicitly.<p>&gt; no more than usual have died in Sweden this year<p>Yes.
