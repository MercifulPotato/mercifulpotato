I’ve already used this feature to write a few tools for myself that greatly improve my note taking workflow.<p>Behind the scenes, Neuron uses Pandoc to convert the markdown into HTML. There is talk of a feature that would allow the user to write Pandoc filters which would essentially be programs that transform the Neuron AST prior to it being rendered with Pandoc. Such a feature would open up tons of opportunities for customization, e.g. you could write rules to parse custom syntax in your markdown files and generate inline HTML. I’ve already written a tool that does something similar [2] without the use of a Pandoc filter by operating directly on the generated HTML files, but a Pandoc filter would greatly improve the process.<p>All of your notes are simply markdown files stored on your local machine, so you’re free to do whatever you’d like with them: store them in git, write scripts to generate them, whatever.<p>The author is simultaneously developing Cerveau [3] which is a hosted web interface that allows you to edit your notes remotely via a web browser. It transparently syncs your edits to a GitHub repository. Unfortunately, Cerveau is currently closed source, but I believe the author has expressed interest in opening it up if he’s able to get enough GitHub sponsors to sustain its development.<p>If it matters to you, Neuron is written in Haskell and the project makes heavy use of Nix.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;srid&#x2F;neuron" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;srid&#x2F;neuron</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;srid&#x2F;neuron&#x2F;issues&#x2F;228#issuecomment-670290253" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;srid&#x2F;neuron&#x2F;issues&#x2F;228#issuecomment-67029...</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cerveau.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cerveau.app</a>')
