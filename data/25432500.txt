Ease of entry, vs tooling to manage the project as it grows. The main reason I see it being an inhibition is due to the size of the HTML spec, and the number of pages that it will need.<p>I think this is why a lot of sites take markdown, then add their own extensions, like how there is &quot;Github Markdown&quot; among many other flavors.
