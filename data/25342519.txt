At my employer, we&#x27;re trying to adopt it, but we&#x27;ve never addressed the underlying performance issues of the microservices, and now the slowness is quite apparent with the GraphQL wrapper tier.<p>This isn&#x27;t a diss to GraphQL. The queries are awesome to write. The developer experience of writing &#x2F; being the client of a GraphQL server is extremely excellent. But I feel I might not be alone in a journey that is playing out to be a mediocre implementation because we are avoiding the core problem.')
