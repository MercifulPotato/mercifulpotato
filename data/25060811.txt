Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=[25061595], score=None, time=1605117351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055800, text='&gt; What matters is not what&#x27;s written, but rather that folks in power choose to abide by it.<p>And whether the other folks can <i>make</i> them abide by it.<p>Take Trump, for example.  He seems to be an authoritarian at heart, and has several times tried to be.  The difference is that the court system didn&#x27;t roll over for him, and society (and the power structure) followed the courts rather than Trump.  So even if Trump wanted to be a dictator for life, the levers of power existed independent of him, and were enough for his opposition to prevent him from doing so.<p>In China, the levers of power are <i>all</i> held by the Communist Party.  And the Communist Party will do whatever Xi says.  There are no non-Xi-controlled levers of power for any opposition to use to block what he wants.  (I suppose there may be limits to how far the Communist Party will follow him.  And there may be limits on how far the people can be pushed before they will revolt against the Communist Party.  But those are the only limits on his power.  No independent judiciary, no opposition party that controls one house of the legislature.)')
