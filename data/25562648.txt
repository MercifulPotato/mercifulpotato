Item(by='randomdata', descendants=None, kids=[25564602, 25563652], score=None, time=1609185811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25561565, text='<i>&gt; This doesn&#x27;t pass the sniff test to me</i><p>Is that because, based on other comments here, you&#x27;re already invested in a kitchen and, as a result, are forgetting to factor in that substantial cost? But that would be like if you owned your own silicon fab. You would no doubt also wonder how anyone could afford to buy their processors from Intel for hundreds of dollars when you can make your own for pennies. But you&#x27;re not actually making them for pennies when you need to lay the capital upfront.<p><i>&gt; Subjectively, I don&#x27;t think that cooking at home is a &quot;luxury&quot;.</i><p>The luxury isn&#x27;t cooking. The luxury is being able to have a large room full of machinery dedicated to preparing meals for, on average, 2.5 people. These days, average people can barely afford living spaces as-is. That room adds to the cost substantially and is not likely to be recouped against eating out, unless eating out means eating at places that are selling entertainment alongside food.<p>It is true that the typical home kitchen can be more cost effective than food entertainment, but that&#x27;s only because your home kitchen does not have to provide the entertainment portion. I do not see these being reasonably comparable when talking about the cost of prepared food. Once you add the cost of equivalent entertainment at home, the food entertainment restaurant looks pretty cheap again.<p><i>&gt; Generally speaking only the lowest economic strata of the working poor depend heavily on fast &amp; packaged food</i><p>Generally speaking, the poor have to buy used houses that already have kitchens for a lot of historical reasons. They have little opportunity to not become invested in the means of production, even when it is not ideal from a purely economic point of view. There are exceptions of places without kitchens, as mentioned earlier in the thread, but they are typically only found where land values are high, where the cost of keeping an existing kitchen is higher than repurposing it.<p>The wealthy, who are most likely to build new houses, that will one day be sold to the poor, want the luxury of having a kitchen even when it is not economically sound, and so the cycle continues.')
