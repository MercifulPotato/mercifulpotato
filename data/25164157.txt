At the time I&#x27;m writing this post, the United States has had 253,309 deaths from 11,789,304 cases, or 2.14%.<p>Without the lockdowns, without the mask mandates, without social distancing, without closing establishments where people congregate, COVID-19 easily overwhelms healthcare systems. We saw this play out in Wuhan, New York City, Italy, and elsewhere. When the healthcare capacity is overwhelmed, the results are catastrophic.<p>It&#x27;s all well and good to say, &quot;well, 2% isn&#x27;t as bad as we thought.&quot; But that&#x27;s not how it is. The problem is that with 10-20% of all patients requiring hospitalization, the hospitals can&#x27;t keep up. Healthcare is a finite resource. It&#x27;s not just the COVID patients who suffer, it&#x27;s everybody who needs hospitalization for anything.<p>It is foolish to act as though this isn&#x27;t as bad as it is.')
