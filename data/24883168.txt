Have you ever tried to teach someone who wasn&#x27;t already enthusiastic about tech? Do you really think most users actually care?<p>Since the beginning of the tech industry, users have been presented over and over again with choices of closed and open tech, centralized and decentralized platforms, and each time users have overwhelmingly chosen the more convenient closed &amp; centralized options. Most people just want to use tech like an appliance that benefits their lives, not teach themselves to manage or understand it.<p>Driving is an apt analogy because the overwhelming majority of people have no idea how to maintain or extend or tinker with their vehicle, nor do they want to learn. They just want to steer their car towards a location much like computer users want to steer their phones to a video or article or profile. Some minimal skill is currently necessary for driving, but even that&#x27;s going away. Soon, cars will drive themselves and the automobile will finally be as convenient as a phone.<p>Kill everyone in tech right now then reset the clock, and in 30 years you&#x27;ll have exactly the same industry. There&#x27;s no tech Illuminati trying to crush general computing, general computing just stopped being necessary.')
