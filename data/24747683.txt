It does exactly the thing it&#x27;s supposed to do. Yes, it is best that potential users wait for now, but that isn&#x27;t because it &quot;doesn&#x27;t do anything&quot;.<p>What it _doesn&#x27;t_ do currently is provide an API which would allow it to be plugged in a similar way to Webpack (not exactly the same, as the deliberate aim is not to cover every usecase, as Webpack allows). This is a requirement for wider adoption as a competitor (rather than just as the module bundling step).  Plus the tree shaking needs work, though I think that is less important than has sometimes been made out.<p>Parcel may have a simple API for simple things, but it&#x27;s extremely slow and generally suffers from exactly the same  issues outlined by OP.')
