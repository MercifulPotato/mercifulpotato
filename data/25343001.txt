It might minify the code to minimize bandwidth, compress images so that they&#x27;re smaller and what not via plugins.<p>The complexity is because while JS is an interpreted language, there&#x27;s often on sizeable projects a mismatch between your source project and how it&#x27;ll run in so many browsers. That could be because you&#x27;re having to support old browser (or just Safari on iOS sometimes), but also because of code structure, and commonly bandwidth concerns. I&#x27;m a frontend project everything gets sent to the customer every time, and you need to do everything possible to shrink things down. However, you also need to have a working environment to develop in, thus the mismatch and the tools to bridge the mismatch.')
