The developer gets to sell the units without any concern for what more people will do to local infrastructure.<p>I guess they could be $15k&#x2F;year, but I&#x27;ve never seen an example that high. My mom lives in Yucca Valley and has two or three Mello Roos items (water district, local community college, and something else), and I think maybe pays about $600 total for them.')
