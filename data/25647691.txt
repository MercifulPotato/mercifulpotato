I love the explicitness and how hard it is to ignore errors - all languages should make it so easy to expect and handle potential errors - but other features (or lack thereof) of the language make it so you canâ€™t handle any of it in concise or sane ways. Code is plastered with the same boilerplate, everywhere, always. It makes up a significant mount of all Go code.')
