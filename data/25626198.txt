Plenty of things like tills and gambling machines were built around things like Pentium IIIs running embedded flavours of WinXP.  The software isn&#x27;t necessarily an issue (if it&#x27;s not exposed to the outside world) but eventually the hardware is going to die.<p>One of these boards would be an undisputable upgrade-- fast enough for purpose, but also fanless, no spinning-rust disc, and lower electrical consuption.  It would require some careful design decisions to provide, say, a video and I&#x2F;O solutions with WinXP drivers.  Imagine one with ISA and PCI slots!')
