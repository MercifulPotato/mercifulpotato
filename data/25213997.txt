Do you really not see how someone on the right could simply accuse you of the same bad behavior as you have of them?<p>&gt; <i>For the record I don’t at all think abortion should be politicized</i><p>But put yourself in a charitable version of your opponent&#x27;s shoes: they believe it&#x27;s a violation of the 5th amendment, and tantamount to murder. From the GOP platform,<p>&gt; <i>the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed</i><p>While I have personally heard convincing counter-arguments to this (as I said, I don&#x27;t agree with the right), I don&#x27;t hear them being stated by anyone at a high level on the left. The left&#x27;s repeated talking point is that women have a right to their own body; but that view ignores, I think, that it&#x27;s fully possible for someone on the right to believe that, but simultaneously believe that the rights of the unborn child take precedence. I have yet to hear someone high on the left address why either they believe that the right&#x27;s stance on an unborn child&#x27;s right to the 5th is wrong (and thus, a woman&#x27;s right prevails as it is the <i>only</i> thing) or why the unborn child&#x27;s right to the 5th is trumped by the woman&#x27;s right to her body.<p>&gt; <i>and it’s tiring to know it’s going nowhere for the future.</i><p>I sincerely think that if the left took the time to argue against the steelmanned argument from the right, we might actually make progress at convincing people, and actually moving the debate forward. But, as it is, one side is screaming &quot;it&#x27;s murder!&quot; the other &quot;women&#x27;s right&#x27;s!&quot;, neither addressing the other&#x27;s position or views. How is that ever to move forward?<p>Yes, there are plenty of uncharitable arguments made by politicians on the right, and one can no doubt cherry-pick an endless litany of examples. But that you <i>can</i> I do not believe frees you from the requirement of arguing a good, solid argument for your own viewpoint. Do you really think that <i>half the nation</i> is doing no more than &quot;pandering to emotion&quot;, or that perhaps some subset of them might sincerely hold a view on the issue that might differ from your own?<p>While I don&#x27;t <i>agree</i> with the right, I can certainly see how anyone on that side would be left utterly unconvinced by the rhetoric being produced on the left.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Straw_man#Steelmanning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Straw_man#Steelmanning</a>')
