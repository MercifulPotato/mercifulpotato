We&#x27;re currently in the process of implementing KC12 using the docker image, a User Storage SPI (our users exist in our legacy master database which is synced from an external billing system), and it&#x27;s looking so far like it&#x27;ll be a fairly simple setup.  This is basically just acting as a OAuth shim between our primary database and an external service provider in our case, which I imagine keeps the complexity down.  But I&#x27;m wondering what you might have run into that we haven&#x27;t yet.  Thanks!')
