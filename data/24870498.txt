Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[24871090], score=None, time=1603466969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869284, text='taken individually, these all seem like minor nitpicks. but together, they make for a pretty high-friction E2E experience on telegram. the first time I try to have a &quot;secret chat&quot; with someone, it&#x27;s often the first time they realize that telegram isn&#x27;t E2E by default or that it even has that feature! I have to wonder about the design decisions made here. it seems pretty obvious that the combination of limitations is going to result in the vast majority of messages not being E2E. in practice, &quot;secret chat&quot; on telegram is only worth the trouble when both participants understand they are doing something shady.')
