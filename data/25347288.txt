Item(by='Hamuko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607444427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344762, text='$549 is way too much to pay for a pair of AirPods Max when you can buy both Sony WH-1000XM4 ($278 on Amazon) and Apple AirPods Pro ($249) for less and still have money left over for a burger. I own a pair of WH-1000XM3s and have thought about the AirPods, since the Sonys are not that portable for all situations. Even if the AirPods Max are really good, I still don&#x27;t see them being the Sony + AirPods Pro combination.')
