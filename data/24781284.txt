Document your hobby projects and put them where they can be examined (I don&#x27;t just mean &quot;put the source on GitHub&quot; as that isn&#x27;t always the best choice, you have other options like giving a presentation and posting the video and slides, or writing a blog post).<p>Unofficial experience is still experience.<p><i>&gt; I am interested in switching to tech career, but afraid that it is very unlikely at my age (34).</i><p>There are some sub-sectors where ageism is worse than others, or where the entry level positions are physically punishing (gaming, for example, where every project seems to be a Death March), but I think you&#x27;ll find that there are many opportunities available to you.<p><i>&gt; There are many similar questions on HN, stackoverflow and quora but most answers are about learning to code rather than career and bread-winning side of it, so lets want to clear this up now, I code C, C++, Python, JS, Rust, Java and stay in touch with latest trends but have no official qualification to prove this. Decided to switch to coding for mainly for challenge and ability to work from home and spend more time with family, want to hear from field experts.</i><p>Well. I think you may be overestimating the benefits of WFH, it can be tough to maintain boundaries. Not having a commute saves time, but being interrupted casually can eat into your productivity a <i>lot</i>. Conversely, you&#x27;re at risk for working longer hours out of guilt that you didn&#x27;t get enough done.<p>Anyway, I recommend having a designated home office with a door that closes, and invest in a <i>very</i> good chair. Also figure out in advance what your solution is going to be if your home power&#x2F;internet fails.<p>Anyway, more specific advice will probably depend on the type of position you&#x27;re looking for (full-time, part-time, independent contractor, consultant, etc.), sector (public, private, NGO), and industry.')
