It will take a round trip for the client to tell the server if an object is cached.<p>So you have two options:<p>1. Pessimistically start pushing the response, and stop if the client tells you it is already cached<p>2. Optimistically don&#x27;t push the response until the client tells you that it doesn&#x27;t have it cached.<p>The first option is what push does.<p>The second option is basically equivalent to sending a `Link: &lt;..&gt; rel=preload` header.<p>So I guess one way to look at is that we had both choices available. But it turns out that Push wasn&#x27;t used much and probably isn&#x27;t the best option.')
