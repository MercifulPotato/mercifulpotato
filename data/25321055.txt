Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607229184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25314592, text='pg is referring there to October 2006, which is when HN was released (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1</a>), so he must have meant that he&#x27;d &quot;finished&quot; it enough to release it. It can&#x27;t mean &quot;finished&quot; the way you&#x27;re interpreting it, because he continued working on HN code for years after that. Indeed, he added a major new feature (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7484304" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7484304</a>) a few days before he left HN (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7493856" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7493856</a>).<p>As someone who&#x27;s worked on HN code since then, I can tell you there&#x27;s no such &quot;mindset&quot;, nor is it true that &quot;we don&#x27;t get any iteration on the feature set here&quot; (11 days ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25197418" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25197418</a>). It is true, though, that most of the changes are subtle enough not to be so visible, including the ones I&#x27;m working on this evening. Most of the effort goes into attempting to improve, or at least preserve, the quality of submissions and comments.')
