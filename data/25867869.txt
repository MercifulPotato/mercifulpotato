Thereâ€™s going to be some dead companies for sure. Where is Mazda on future tech?<p>Mazda&#x27;s CX5 handily outsells Tesla&#x27;s Model Y.<p>I think the thing that a lot of people don&#x27;t understand about Tesla, is that most people can&#x27;t afford to spend $60,000 on a car. The Mazda CX5 has a MSRP of $25,270.<p>There&#x27;s tons of people who buy things based on price, and battery prices aren&#x27;t getting any cheaper.<p>On top of this, the CX5 competes in a segment where there&#x27;s at least fifteen competitors, whereas the Model Y is (mostly) competing with the Jaguar I-Pace and Audi E-Tron.')
