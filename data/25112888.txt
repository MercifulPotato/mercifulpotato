I have been watching this show now for 20 years and very little has changed. Linux Desktop evangelists keep telling people they should use Linux Desktop, and keep get told by potential users why they aren&#x27;t using Linux Desktop, then they ignore it. Linux Desktop evangelists have tied Linux to their identity in such a way that they interpret any criticism as a personal attack and defend themselves with the same tired old stock arguments. These types of articles appeal to the Linux Desktop evangelist because they soothe them.')
