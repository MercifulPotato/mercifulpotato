A cheap stove and refrigerator are about $500 each. Cabinets for the small but fully functional kitchen in my small bay area apartment could be had for as little as $1000 based on a quick look at Home Depot. Countertops can vary widely, but lets throw in another $2000. That could be enough for granite if you don&#x27;t have too much counter space.<p>For quick and dirty estimates, it&#x27;s reasonable to double your cost of materials to get a total job cost. Framing is going to be less than $1000 in lumber (probably a lot less) for an apartment kitchen and that&#x27;s at today&#x27;s historically rather high lumber prices. Electrical is going to be maybe $500 at most. I&#x27;m a lot less versed in plumbing so I can&#x27;t estimate that off the top of my head, but lets say that it somehow comes out to as much as the framing and electrical combined. Adding all that up and doubling it brings us to $6000 in construction costs.<p>All in that&#x27;s ~$10,000.<p>$2000 isn&#x27;t realistic if you&#x27;re counting all materials from the ground up, but $60,000 is a comical number. That might be the average cost of your typical McMansion kitchen with high end appliances, but it&#x27;s not representative of what it&#x27;s going to cost to build a kitchen in a small to medium sized rental apartment.')
