Item(by='chrisseaton', descendants=None, kids=[24679903], score=None, time=1601825780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679729, text='&gt; I see it as a different flavour of English.<p>I think you&#x27;re being very generous there in painting it as some kind of naturally occurring dialect of a culture.<p>&gt; The document you share is using UK English as the standard to follow<p>Incorrect. It refers to and compares against Irish English and US English as well, as people would in fact normally understand it. It&#x27;s not academic or prescriptive.<p>&gt; In practice we already use EU English, both in official documents and communications, and in casual exchanges.<p>You can&#x27;t convince me people are using contorted jargon like &#x27;financial envelope&#x27; in casual exchanges with anyone.<p>These are the problems in practice:<p>&gt;  the European institutions also need to communicate with the outside world and our documents need to be translated â€“ both\ntasks that are not facilitated by the use of terminology that is unknown to native speakers and either does not appear in\ndictionaries or is shown in them with a different meaning<p>It&#x27;s not just a case of &#x27;not recognising it officially&#x27; - nobody understands it and dictionaries (of any dialect) don&#x27;t help.<p>What is the point of a dialect that only people writing reports, not reading them (the actual people they&#x27;re governing), understands?')
