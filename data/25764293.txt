It&#x27;s a bit like gmail; they offered 1 GB at the time (if I recall correctly?) which was a ridiculous amount that in practice, 99% of people would NEVER reach. But it was great PR. Mind you, gmail is &quot;free&quot;.<p>If Dropbox were to offer a 500GB package for half price, 99% of their customers that found out about it would switch to that. What&#x27;s worse, they would likely open themselves up to a class action suit for people who feel like they overpaid for years.<p>Introducing a cheaper, lower capacity subscription now would be suicide for the company.')
