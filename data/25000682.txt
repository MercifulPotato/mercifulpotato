IPv6 is fantastic for two reasons:  address space and no NAT.<p>NAT, network address translation, means an artificial address space.  That is all it means and it is limited by network size, even if that network is artificially addressed with nonrouteable addresses, which is small compared to PAT (port address translation).<p>NAT is great if you want to hide from the world.  It doesn&#x27;t mean you have privacy.  Everything can still leak out.  It just means the outside cannot see you without a tunnel.  In many way that actually hurts privacy because you cannot establish a point-to-point tunnel without a third party and that third party must have access to the transmission headers.  NAT was never created for privacy or security.  NAT and PAT were only created to extend the range of IPv4 addresses.<p>In the web there is no point-to-point communication such as client-to-client.  The web is only client-server.  You make a request to the server, which establishes a tunnel and the server talks back with a response that follows the request in reverse.  If you wanted to talk with a peer you would do so through a server.  For example if you use iMessenger, Signal, or whatever you aren&#x27;t directly talking to people.  You are talking to a server and that server shares your messages with your friends.  The server sees everything... no privacy.  Even with end-to-end encryption you still relay everything through a server that knows half of every conversation.<p>IPv6 does not have NAT.  That is great.  The security benefits of an artificial address space that isn&#x27;t routed are still available in IPv6.  This is from a range of addresses called <i>link local</i> that do not route.<p>Since there is no NAT in IPv6 if you can see an outside computer that outside computer can see you equally.  That means you don&#x27;t need a server to chat with your friends.  Just directly talk to your damn friends.  No tunnel needed.  End-to-end encryption can be as simple as HTTPS.  You cannot get that with IPv4, largely due to NAT.<p>Yes, only nerds care about privacy.... Well, no.  If privacy is the default and end-to-end encryption is always the default you can do things and share things you would NEVER in a million years put on Facebook, because its actually private, like giving a USB hard drive directly to your life partner.  That is a massive new set of business opportunities that scares the shit out of people on today&#x27;s web (for good reason).')
