The reason why you see linked lists so much in old C stuff is (IMO) similar to the reason you see null terminated strings (and the associated bugs if you truncate incorrectly). And that&#x27;s because of one of C&#x27;s original sin: the failure to include size information in array objects.<p>There is also the claim that linked lists are better in certain types of performance sensitive code because you can sometimes avoid allocating. I don&#x27;t fully understand the logic there myself but I trust that there are cases where this is true.')
