I assume stolen parts are profitable only in the market where this parts are hard to find, like for expensive limited edition cars. Make the parts available from multiple vendors , have them cheaper and less people would risk their liberty for cheap parts.<p>Maybe we should also solve the crime problem more directly by catching the criminals or giving them jobs and not by screwing the society with making things un-repairable (and what I coincidence this is also very profitable for the big companies and affects only the small business and citizens, but yeah coincidences happen I am sure Tesla and Apple were thinking about theft and not about money)')
