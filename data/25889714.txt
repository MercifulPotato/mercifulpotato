The refills cost too much. I know one wine company here in NorCal that has one that they hacked with a line to a commercial grade tank of argon to reduce the cost (a Coravin on a long tube to a big tank...and yes they are all ex-techies). I have thought about getting one for awhile but the cost is just too much and I own 2672 bottles right now (yes, I may have a problem, but it down from a high of 4907 - Covid times). For the most part any bottle we open gets finished in 2 days. For any $$ bottle, it is opened with friends (not in Covid time but..) and it will get finished that evening.<p>The real interesting use for the Coravin is for when you have a number of the same bottles and you want to taste it over time to see how it ages. Buy a case, set it down and Coravin a bottle and taste it every year to see the progression.<p>Anyway wine is a fun thing to get into as long as you understand that $$$ does = best. I have had some $1000 bottles that are amazing wines, but not more amazing then a $100 bottle. The exception would be some very very old bottles 30+ years, but that is an acquired taste as old wine is very different from the normal today to 10 years that most people drink.')
