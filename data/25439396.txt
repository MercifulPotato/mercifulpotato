Not only would the attacker need to know precise detail about the exact methods and steps taken by a russia-sponsored group, the attacker would also need to entirely suppress their own methods and approaches so that they are not identifiable as themselves.<p>Much easier to simply hide who you are by changing your compromise fingerprint than to try to impersonate someone else&#x27;s compromise fingerprint.<p>If a technique is seen in this attack that has been seen in previous attacks which are now known to be by a russia-sponsored group, that is very strong evidence that the same group is responsible.  It is not proof, but it is strong evidence.')
