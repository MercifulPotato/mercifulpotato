They just need exposure.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s cold outside, put a jacket on or you&#x27;ll catch a cold!&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t debunked yet but it&#x27;s had plenty exposure over decades at this point.<p>Some things are just too boring to question so plenty of people continue to put on a jacket to avoid catching the cold, which does nothing, rather than washing their hands before touching their face, which could stop some spread.<p>Eric S Raymond&#x27;s all bugs are shallow thing appealed to me but hasn&#x27;t really worked that way. I think that&#x27;s a similar story.<p>I think this premise of exposure always solving radical ideas is likely to be false but it&#x27;s not without merit because exposure and illumination are such great tools in other cases that are very like this problem.')
