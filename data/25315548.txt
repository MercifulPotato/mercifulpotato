Mozilla is not perfect but they do push for privacy, with an increasingly limited amount of negotiating power.<p>&gt; DoH is absolutely designed to get around network based security and filtering, both for Ad&#x27;s and other reasons.<p>This is similarly reflecting a poor understanding of the situation. DoH can’t get around network filtering - if you block packets, there’s no magic trick to bypass it. It’s great for preventing ISPs from tampering with traffic or monitoring activity (this will also require eSNI to complete) but it’s not giving an attacker any capability they didn’t already have. If you’re concerned about security you’re fooling yourself if you don’t have endpoint management and some level of network segmentation and egress control. Attackers have hard-coded DNS servers, C&amp;C endpoints, etc. for decades.')
