Any Objective-C developer worth his&#x2F;her salt will drop down to C code when you need to optimize. The object-oriented parts of Objective-C are way slower than Java. But the reason Objective-C programs can still outcompete Java programs is that you have the opportunity to pick hotspots and optimize the hell out of them using C code.<p>Object-oriented programs in Objective-C are written in a very different fashion from Java programs. Java programs tend to have very fine granularity on their objects. Objective-C programs tend to have interfaces which are bulkier, and larger objects.<p>That is partly why you can have a high performance 3D API like Metal written in a language such as Objective-C which has very slow method dispatch. It works because the granularity of the objects have been designed with that in mind.')
