Maybe I have read too many dystopian novels like fahrenheit 451, or 1984, or read too much about Chinese govt&#x27;s control of its population, but I feel that modern technology has allowed too much censorship power in hands of not just the govt, but a few corporations. And it is extremely important that we do not compromise on free speech now.')
