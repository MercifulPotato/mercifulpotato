Of course its obvious how the debate was going to be framed from the beginning: Facebook is supposed to be &quot;unbiased&quot; and from this point of view political inaction is the high-minded route over traditional low-minded autocratic rule. Instead of possibly curating a high-quality news feed for users to consume, users get to pick what they want to listen to because to force a user to watch something they created would be biased against the individual &quot;news&quot; organizations that operate on it. So Facebook does have smart leadership and have been proving themselves to more resemble an unbiased company compared than an autocratic government with some fake news initiatives.<p>However, our individual news feeds are not biased. By letting individuals control what they see, increases their bias. From this perspective, Facebook is now inherently biased towards extremism (our sad reality proves this point)<p>The way out of this situation is confusing and neither Facebook nor the movie talk of any real action. How about, instead of trying to clutch our unbiased pearls, we collectively learn to appreciate and understand inherent biases in everything because everything involving humans and our psyche is inherently biased and there is no end objective truth to the big issues surrounding our differences in values.<p>Now the question becomes not of bias vs facts, but of better and worse bias. If we could create a Facebook news stream that is inherently biased towards bringing people together rather than splitting us apart, it rather appears to solve this new question quite cleanly and as a plus fixes our pathetic situation. This isn&#x27;t a radical new idea created in my head 2 hours ago, its a rather established view on this important issue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZbPt66TYsFM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZbPt66TYsFM</a><p>The big question I think should be how do we design this &quot;good&quot; bias into our social media and how do we convince everyone everything is biased literally no point in finding unbiased sources of anything to reframe the debate to be on good versus bad bias.')
