If I&#x27;m using fossil, I just do. Fossil is built by the people behind sqlite, and issues, wikis, etc... all of the pm stuff is baked in. Tickets that are referenced in check-ins are synced. This improves on github: if another dev has worked on a ticket and their branch hasn&#x27;t merged yet, the ticket update is visible. Fossil also allows for heirarchal management structures, and so on. Incidentally, fossil&#x27;s timeline is incredible.<p>Not saying that fossil is going to replace git&#x2F;github. Probably not, but there are ways to solve simple information management problems that don&#x27;t require a centralized, subscription service. By eliminating that, you open the door to much innovation... In the meantime, I&#x27;ve got a pull request or two to review over on Github.')
