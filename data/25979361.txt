A Google worker in Europe also said they hadn’t known about the announcement, but noted they typically don’t find out about union news before it becomes public.</i><p>&gt; <i>Uni told The Verge that McEnany was “very involved” in the alliance, and during the meeting, McEnany acknowledged he was partly to blame — he’d told Uni to attribute the quote to Koul.</i><p>So... just your standard communications mixups? I mean, if the journalist has to quote a Googler who didn&#x27;t know about the announcement but admits they don&#x27;t typically get non-public union announcements <i>anyways</i>... it tells me there isn&#x27;t much here.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really seem like &quot;turmoil&quot; to me, but more of a journalist trying to create a sensationalistic narrative.')
