Should MC and Visa really dictate how people make their business? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Sure CP is very, very bad but I have been using Pornhub for many years and I have never seen such content on the platform. This is one big reason why I think decentralized currencies like bitcoin one day could succeed.<p>IMO, this is the golden quote:<p>&gt; Pornhub&#x27;s announcement also cites a report by third-party Internet Watch Foundation, which found 118 instances of child sexual abuse material on Pornhub in the last three years, and notes that in the same period, Facebook&#x27;s own transparency report found 84 million instances of child sexual abuse material on the social media platform.<p>In despite the nature of the content on Pornhub and the amount uploaded there is very few instances of CP on the platform which I think speaks to their good work in preventing it.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know about piracy but that also seems like something that is.. uncommon?<p>EDIT: People who downvote me, why?')
