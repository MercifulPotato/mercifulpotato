Item(by='jjoonathan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603809713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907631, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see widespread criticism against US non-state companies BECAUSE of their involvement with the US.<p>I do. The NSA comes up all the damn time. As it should.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t see many people calling for the banning of US non-state companies.<p>People don&#x27;t call for it because they just do it. It&#x27;s not controversial. It was half of China&#x27;s strategy and it has worked out spectacularly well for them because the US turned the other cheek.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t see US students and researchers being ousted out of other countries for being potential spies, even though there&#x27;s no proof.<p>If there&#x27;s no proof, it&#x27;s really an economic thing, not a spy thing. I got kicked out of Cambridge because my prospective PhD advisor had chosen to fund me with a grant that, it turned out, was exclusive to EU citizens. Outside the US this sort of protectionism doesn&#x27;t merely exist, it exists <i>and isn&#x27;t controversial</i>.<p>&gt; Calling out the CCP, and blanket banning all Chinese companies, are not at all the same thing, or even on the same level.<p>We do the former because it&#x27;s right and the latter because it&#x27;s in our rational self interest. Just like China.')
