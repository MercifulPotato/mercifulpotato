(sdLDL-P, ldLDL-P, full lipid panel, A1C)<p>- Hormone levels in blood (All hormone types)<p>- Antibody tests, WBC&#x2F;CD4 count, cytokines, etc..<p>- Preferences to set different unit measurement standards.<p>- Ability to export to a USB memory card in json and text output on exFAT or ext4 formatted drives.<p>All of this without requiring any connections to the internet.  This would be for me, not a business.  I suspect there are businesses that could use this too.  They could submit the json output into a cloud site assuming legal compliance, etc...<p>Devices would be for rough preliminary screenings, to avoid repeated outsourced labs until red flags appear and to adjust dietary intake and exercise for optimal levels.  Primary audience for this would likely be professional athletes, body builders, health enthusiasts, biohackers.  I would pay good money for something like this.  Less than 90% accuracy is fine for some tests provided it displays the estimated accuracy or range.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021-01-method-pocket-sized-dna-sequencer-near-perfect.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021-01-method-pocket-sized-dna-sequen...</a>')
