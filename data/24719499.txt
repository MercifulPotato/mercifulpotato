For someone who has no need for that level of low level control&#x2F;performance, Rust is generally not a language you want to use, for sure.<p>&gt; A lot of the main &quot;selling points&quot; of Rust are getting introduced in C++<p>It is true that you could, with sufficient coding standards and linters, get something approximately like Rust by using C++, where the linter disallows any non safe pointers, any use of null or nullable types without wrapping it in a variant, disallowing all cases of undefined behavior, and so on.  However you would have something a lot less pleasant to use than using Rust in the first place, build times would probably end up worse with those thing enforced as a build step, and setting up such an environment would be non trivial and you basically are just building rust out of C++, twine and gum, so why not just use Rust?')
