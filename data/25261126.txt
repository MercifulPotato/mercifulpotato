It&#x27;s killing people 4x as fast as Covid, and yet nobody cares!<p>And do <i>WHAT</i>, for them?  What concrete thing are you supposed to <i>DO</i>?<p>No matter what <i>YOU</i> think is a solution, most of the homeless will <i>refuse consent</i>.  Now what?<p>You can&#x27;t just <i>force</i> a person into mental health or drug treatment without their consent unless they commit a crime or are an immediate danger to themselves.<p>Needle exchanges help.  Methadone clinics help.  And for the people who don&#x27;t comply?<p>Most of the &quot;homeless solutions&quot; are effectively &quot;move them somewhere else--preferably jail&quot;.  That&#x27;s really what people who want SF to &quot;get control&quot; of the homeless problem actually want.')
