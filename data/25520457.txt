Posts and shares are listed in chronological order without anything missing (which is absolutely NOT true for the normal news feed, even when &quot;chronological order&quot; is selected). No &quot;so-and-so commented on this&quot; or &quot;so-and-so liked that&quot;. Just posts and shares. Scroll through the feed until you recognize something, and you&#x27;re done.<p>On youtube, you really should be going straight to subscriptions first. If you want to look for recommendations that&#x27;s perfectly fine, you can go to the home page... but don&#x27;t go there by default.<p>On reddit, I recommend using &#x2F;r&#x2F;all as a portal with some of the more obnoxious subreddits blocked.<p>I&#x27;m aware that what you see is still influenced by the algorithm in these examples, but the impact is reduced by a lot.<p>Browse with intention. Make deliberate choices. Don&#x27;t just let the algorithm lead you around.<p>Remember, &quot;the algorithm&quot;s on these sites aren&#x27;t designed for your benefit. They&#x27;re designed to increase the site&#x27;s metrics. More clicks. More time on that website.')
