I fought long battles with my snooze button, and realized I was spending hours each morning hitting the snooze button. I realized if I just didn&#x27;t set an alarm I&#x27;d probably get up later than I usually set my alarm for, but earlier than I typically got out of bed. It worked; I started waking up refreshed, and happy to get out of bed in the morning.<p>When I had an important exam or something else I really didn&#x27;t want to miss, I&#x27;d set an alarm for a while. But then I just went all in, and never set an alarm. That made me pay more attention to when I was going to bed at night, and the quality of my sleep. When I started working I would set an alarm for about half an hour after I typically woke up, just in case, so I wouldn&#x27;t be late for work. But after six months of that, I stopped setting my backup alarm as well. I was late for work maybe twice in five years, and it was never significantly late, and it was at times where my body really needed sleep and it probably helped me avoid getting sick. These days I only set an alarm if I have to catch a 6am flight, or if I&#x27;m getting up super early to climb a mountain or something.<p>If you&#x27;re battling your alarm every day, I highly encourage you to experiment with not setting an alarm.')
