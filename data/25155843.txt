It does not require a whole pile of skill to purchase a few rack mount servers from Dell or Supermicro with onsite 24 hour warranty, and plonk them in a co-lo.  In the rare event the hardware does break ring Dell and ask them to fix it for you.  When the onsite warranty end&#x27;s in 7 years it&#x27;s time to replace the servers.<p>The expertise required it literally minimal - not much beyond the ability to use a screw driver to install it into the rack and know how to connect the Ethernet cables.  Then you have to plug in a USB and install whatever OS you want, of course, but you don&#x27;t have to be onsite to do that.  They all come with iDRAC&#x27;s or the equivalent.<p>They will cost about $1000&#x2F;yr with maybe 10TB raid disk, co-lo costs of around another $1000&#x2F;yr for unlimited bandwidth.  To rent the same dedicated metal is about $500&#x2F;mo from OHV where I live, so over twice the cost.<p>Obviously, this is all impossible if you aren&#x27;t big enough to have dedicated IT staff.  And obviously, if you are likely to go through rapid change (well, something more extreme than adding a new server every now and then), it isn&#x27;t the best plan.  But for a stable mature business that employs several hundred people, all you are really doing is cutting out the middle man.')
