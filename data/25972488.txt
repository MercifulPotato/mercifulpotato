Since the borrowed stock has already been resold (the stock the HF didn&#x27;t own to begin with), now the question is if the HF can even afford to buy them all back. This is why the entire market dropped the other day, because HFs were selling off other positions to come up with the money. Sell offs could get a lot worse considering $GME is still currently shorted over 100%.<p>If the govt steps in to save the hedge funds at the expense of millions of average Joe&#x27;s, or if the hedge funds pull some sort of bankruptcy loophole card resulting in the average Joe&#x27;s holding the bag while they continue on, we could see people revolt against the entire financial system as we know it.')
