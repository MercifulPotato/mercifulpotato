Death of 1000 cuts.<p>A service must be really compelling and unique to persuade people to commit to an open-ended subscription on top of everything else crying for their dollars.<p>That&#x27;s why the likes of Apple are racing to bundle their services for a single monthly family fee, they&#x27;re getting ahead of &#x27;subscription fatigue&#x27; where the mental and financial burden of managing a plethora of small monthly charges becomes overwhelming.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s less than a starbucks latte.<p>That&#x27;s a perfect analogy. The majority of people in any population don&#x27;t buy a Starbucks latt√© because the cost-value assessment indicates it&#x27;s not worth it on top of more essential daily living costs.')
