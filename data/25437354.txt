What you criticise about regulations can be said about laws. A law can protect a vile dictator as easily as protect a helpless citizen.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the laws or regulations, but the fact that we leave corrupt politicians to write them.<p>Of course, fixing that is much easier than done, because even if you have a functioning democracy, corrupt politicians are still propped up by propaganda. Corporate&#x27;s wishing to write the laws contribute much to support those politicians with lobbying and propaganda (Murdoch news empire)<p>To solve this you need a well-educated, politically conscious population, which is easier said than done.')
