Saying NPM has millions of packages is completely misleading.  There will be 20, 30, 40 packages that all do the same thing.<p>Elixir is also a very stable language with no current plans for a 2.0 release.  This means that while a lot of Hex packages may not have been updated in a while, they are still rock solid.  I agree that this is a very hard thing to get used to since the first thing I always do is looked at the last commit date and then the number of stars.  While this is still useful, it doesn&#x27;t hold the same weight it does in other ecosystems.  Personally, I think this is how it should be.<p>I won&#x27;t say that the Elixir ecosystem is perfect, though.  There has been trouble with maintainers leaving projects, but to knowledge someone always steps up.')
