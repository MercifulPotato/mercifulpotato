Item(by='ipython', descendants=None, kids=[25115772], score=None, time=1605554006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113393, text='Geez, because there are more than first-order effects from the person who contracts the virus... this argument ticks me off so much, as if the only concern is &quot;well, I don&#x27;t die&#x2F;get sick&#x2F;have lasting effects, so what is the big darn deal?&quot;<p>Let me tell you what the big darn deal is, from the perspective of someone who likely <i>won&#x27;t get sick either</i>.<p>My wife just suffered through sepsis from a previous surgery. She ended up being admitted into the ICU for three days. I learned after the fact that there are roughly 40 staffed ICU beds in the entire county, population ~400,000. Those beds could easily be taken by COVID patients in a situation where you have uncontrolled community spread, and the hospital is now making difficult choices of who deserves those beds.<p>Now as she recovers her immune system is still fragile. In her normal condition, she probably would be OK after contracting COVID-19. Now, perhaps not so much. If others around me assume that contracting COVID-19 is &quot;no big deal&quot; and end up transmitting it to her, that may not be a problem for <i>those</i> people. It would be a huge deal for <i>me</i>.<p>What&#x27;s missing in these rosy pictures of COVID-19 is the lack of awareness that... gasp... we live with <i>other people</i>, and that we all have a duty to protect each other, not just ourselves! What is so wrong with that? If wearing a mask helps me protect others around me, then why not do it? Honestly, if that&#x27;s the worst encumbrance you&#x27;ve encountered in your life so far, then you&#x27;ve had quite the privileged experience, and as I&#x27;d say to my children, you&#x27;re damn spoiled.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to listen to me, listen to the people who have taken an oath to protect my life and yours: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-enraging-deja-vu-of-a-third-coronavirus-wave" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-enraging-deja-vu-of-a...</a>. It&#x27;s absurd the entitlement that some people display, thinking &quot;well, if something bad happens to me, there will be someone to save me&quot;. At the end of the day, the nurses and doctors that treat you <i>are people too</i>. Respecting them means more than sending flowers or banging on pots, it means doing your part to help ensure they can care for the true emergencies and not just idiots who can&#x27;t be bothered to follow some simple rules to help out the greater good.')
