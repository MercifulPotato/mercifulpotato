Item(by='ddevault', descendants=None, kids=[25608668], score=None, time=1609544655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25608425, text='&gt;Mobility in entry-level jobs isn&#x27;t as bad as you make it out to be (I worked plenty of these as recently as a year ago).<p>Having been there, too, and knowing many others who have had similar experiences, I don&#x27;t think you fully understand what it&#x27;s like for most people working low-wage jobs.<p>&gt;There are zero jobs in the world without a dark side. Or as you say, &quot;blood on their hands&quot;. Even the tiniest non-profit, village bakery might accidentally source ingredients from exploited farm workers in 3rd world countries, or pay tax dollars which goes into US war efforts.<p>There is an important difference. The bakery accidentally sourced those ingredients - and I&#x27;d expect them to change if it was brought to their attention. Megacorps deliberately and cognizantly engage in the behaviors we&#x27;re discussing. Everyone is required to pay taxes, so that point can be dismissed. We are accountable to our country&#x27;s misdeeds, but in a much different way and with a much different approach for addressing the problem. You can change your employer (as a tech worker enjoying excellent mobility) much more easily than you can change your nationality.')
