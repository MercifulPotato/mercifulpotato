In such cases they can get top scores without learning anything.<p>If you’re arguing that they reflect having learned the material at some time.  I knew people with significant time pressure like a full time job that knew the material very well, but simply aimed for a lower grade on assignments as a means of managing their time.  Grading on a curve means you need to find something that separates A’s from B’s when everyone learns the material and that’s often just effort.')
