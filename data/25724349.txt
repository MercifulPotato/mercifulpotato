But I don’t think many frosh are doing that. We’ll be off campus for the spring too no matter what (they will prioritize juniors and seniors for graduation), so it makes sense to just do it all remotely.<p>Where the timing really sucks is on planning off-campus living away from home. I’m not endorsing leisure travel, but the thought of living at home for 6+ more months isn’t great for a lot of us. With classes starting tomorrow, though, it’s going to be tough for people to make arrangements (unless you want to move mid-way through the term, when coursework is heavy).')
