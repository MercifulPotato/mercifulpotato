Used to have an assignment where we as developers would write automated tests (regression tests), while we had an experienced software tester with an excel sheet verifying things by hand. But instead of just following the sheet - which is automatable - he knew of a number of different techniques and approaches and he&#x27;d still find a lot of issues that nobody else found. For which we&#x27;d write a test to avoid it happening again.<p>I mean I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if they wrote more automated tests themselves, but I&#x27;m also very aware that the mindset of me and developers would quickly become &quot;it&#x27;s not my responsibility to test my software&quot;.')
