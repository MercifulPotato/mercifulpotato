The guy&#x27;s vanity wouldn&#x27;t allow him to wear a mask to act as a good example to his base. He blatantly ignored most of what his advisors told him and proceeded to advocate quack remedies and dubious advice.<p>I really dislike the trope of &quot;all politicians lie&quot; when discussing Trump. It&#x27;s the worst kind of &quot;what about-ism&quot;. I do value a president talking to the American people like we are adults and tell us uncomfortable truths. I think Obama tried that on occasion ands it backfired on him in a major way (comment about those that cling to guns and religion comes to mind).<p>I do agree with you that it&#x27;s not solely Trump&#x27;s fault. The republican party quickly fell into step behind him to get their way above any sort of moral high ground they could have hoped to claim in the past.')
