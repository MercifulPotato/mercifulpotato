It&#x27;s a super exciting project.<p>As a very long time Django developer I see the potential for it to finally replace Django in jamstack-type apps. But two things are direly missing for that to be the default IMO:<p>1. A flexible admin. Django&#x27;s admin allows for super fast prototyping. I wrote an accounting&#x2F;bookkeeping app recently which I used for myself, and I didn&#x27;t write a UI for it at all for several <i>months</i> because I could just get by with the admin. (Filed two quarterlies with just the admin as UI!)<p>2. An ORM that is as natural as Django&#x27;s. I love SQLAlchemy but its syntax is a huge turnoff. I imagine the &quot;right solution&quot; combines the best of both worlds; maybe some Django-like syntax wrapper around SQLAlchemy. â€¦ with typings.<p>What do you think, is there progress in those areas?')
