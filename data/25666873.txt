It is the world&#x27;s leading jailer on a per-capita basis. [1] Two thirds of private prisons (which lets step back for a second is horrifying as a concept) include <i>minimum occupancy</i> clauses. [2] This is an utter failure of the state in its duty of care to its citizens. To call this a conflict of interest doesn&#x27;t even begin to do it justice.<p>The incarceration rate among African Americans is almost 7X that of white folks in America. Criminality and race do not go hand in hand, therefore there exists a real and meaningful problem that is disproportionately affecting a racial group. A social and&#x2F;or economic problem.<p>African Americans have way more interaction with police and policing, and even if you believe there&#x27;s no racial disparity in the way those interactions go down - that instead they&#x27;re killed and harassed at the same rate as white folks on a per-encounter basis - the fact is they have way, way more encounters per capita. This is likely a function of the society that America has built and fostered.<p>The reaction and the frustration and the protest is still justified even if you believe that race didn&#x27;t play a factor in the specific instances, and even if you believe there&#x27;s no systemic issue with policing.<p>Now, there&#x27;s also evidence that there <i>is</i> a difference in how they are treated by police, but I think my argument holds even if you reject that premise.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_incarceration_rate#:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%202016,the%20population%20was%20behind%20bars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_incarceration_ra...</a>.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonlegalnews.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;jul&#x2F;31&#x2F;report-finds-two-thirds-private-prison-contracts-include-lockup-quotas&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonlegalnews.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;jul&#x2F;31&#x2F;report-find...</a>')
