If you want an introduction to philosophy, you could start with logic&#x2F;reasoning&#x2F;plato&#x2F;pre-socratics&#x2F;etc. It will help you think rationally and logically. But it won&#x27;t give you answers to &quot;life&#x27;s bigger questions&quot;. It&#x27;ll give you tools to think about them and introduce you to what others think&#x2F;believe&#x2F;etc.<p>If you want the answers to &quot;life&#x27;s bigger questions&quot;, then you are really talking about religion rather than philosophy.')
