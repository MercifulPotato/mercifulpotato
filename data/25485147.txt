I wrote about it briefly on my blog, as incomplete as it may be, here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kronis.dev&#x2F;everything%20is%20broken&#x2F;nextcloud-is-broken" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kronis.dev&#x2F;everything%20is%20broken&#x2F;nextcloud-i...</a><p>In summary:<p>- Nextcloud failed to update from the version 17 to 20 - it did inform me that it can&#x27;t do this, but not before attempting to update the version number and essentially breaking itself. That said, other software, such as phpBB is also known for brittle updates between major versions.<p>- After a re-install of the latest version, it failed to allow clients to connect to it through HTTPS (reverse proxy setup), though this proved to be a problem in the default configuration.<p>- It then also failed to synchronize all of my files once i dumped them into the sync folder, though that&#x27;s a lesser issue.<p>- The new Talk ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com&#x2F;talk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com&#x2F;talk&#x2F;</a> ) application is enabled by default and for some reason noticeably slowed down the whole system, even when not in active use - page loads went from 1-2 seconds to approx. 3-10.<p>Despite all of that, i would still recommend Nextcloud, because there isn&#x27;t much software like it out there, and when it works, it is actually pretty okay.<p>Provided you follow these suggestions:<p>- Always have working backups. I personally use BackupPC ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backuppc.github.io&#x2F;backuppc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backuppc.github.io&#x2F;backuppc&#x2F;</a> ) which i self-host, cloud vendors also offer managed options.<p>- Stick to a single major version, update manually. In the case of Docker, i just stick to a particular image tag, such as :20.0.2-apache.<p>- When updating, have the backups ready and be prepared to wipe and reinstall the application. Never store anything in Nextcloud that you&#x27;re not prepared to have unavailable for a while. As for the apps (like Talk or Calendar), where you can&#x27;t export the data to later import it, be prepared to lose it, or use another alternative.<p>Sadly this will mean that for a while your instance will be insecure, but the current circumstances force me to prefer working software over secure software.')
