That is doable if there is a single application vendor for a given file format, but a total nightmare if you are trying to write code for the last 3 versions of 5 different browsers.<p>But SQLite was also a problem for anyone that wanted different semantics than what SQLite offered, like statically typed columns.  Better to just provide a fast indexing mechanism and let people define semantics on top of that.')
