What was decided, correctly, in the Citizens United vs. FEC case was the right for political activism from non-campaign affiliated entities (like corporates, nonprofits, labor unions, etc.). The context for that decision was FEC&#x27;s attempt to censor a film from a conservative group made in response to FEC&#x27;s refusal of classify Michael Moore&#x27;s Fahrenheit 9&#x2F;11 as political &#x27;expenditure&#x27; (a film which had a clearly stated goal of getting Bush out of office). The FEC set a bullshit &#x27;bona fide commercial film maker&#x27; as a standard for their decision, and when Citizen&#x27;s United restablished itself as a film maker, their next film (an anti-Hillary documentary) was also found to be in violation. In no universe was FEC&#x27;s policy fair and objective. From wikipedia, here&#x27;s a crazy argument the government tried to make:<p>&quot;During the original oral argument, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L. Stewart (representing the FEC) argued that under Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the government would have the power to ban books if those books contained even one sentence expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate and were published or distributed by a corporation or labor union. In response to this line of questioning, Stewart further argued that under Austin the government could ban the digital distribution of political books over the Amazon Kindle or prevent a union from hiring an author to write a political book.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t that an insane conjecture? This exchange by itself probably lost the FEC the case.<p>&gt;Imagine a world where there was no money in politics.<p>Such a world never existed, does not exist, and will never exist. Politics are a center of power. You can ban money all you want, but all you&#x27;ll accomplish is create a &#x27;black market&#x27;. I posit that you do not want to live in such a world.')
