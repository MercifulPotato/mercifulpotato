For example, in France, as a business, you can&#x27;t accept payment in cash above 1000â‚¬. Between consumers, you need to produce an invoice.<p>I personally deeply disagree with the EFF regarding FinCEN. From my point of view, the obligation imposed by the regulation strikes a good balance between protecting private life and fighting tax dodging and money laundering.
