Many people bought a house a long time ago so their cost is lower. Also many people went to college a long time ago and aren’t spending anything on it now. Also, many people are healthy, and if they’re not insured then they’re not paying for healthcare.<p>This is about real people in the real world, it’s just not necessarily current prices, and it’s an average. The average experience isn’t going to be all that relevant to you if you do need to pay current prices.')
