Even if we do stop at the 1.5 C limit, it seems silly to say &quot;manageable&quot;. We are already seeing massive a drop-off in biodiversity and increases in extinctions. We don&#x27;t even fully know how the ecological damage we&#x27;re already seeing will echo into the future, but the outcomes are almost certainly not good.<p>Beyond the unknowns of ecological damage, the increases in forest fire and storm event damages we&#x27;re already seeing are also hitting us now, not in decades. Further, from everything I have read thus far since that report was released , most of the models have underestimated the release of methane, which could mean we&#x27;re already accelerating faster than previously thought. All of this also assumes that there will be a massive effort to cut emissions to 0 in a reasonable time - a big assumption in the time of Trump&#x27;s America.')
