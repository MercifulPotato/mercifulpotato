The only thing that makes it more similar to C than to C++ is that C is an extremely simple language, as is Zig, while C++ is an extremely complex language. But other than that, Zig is a low-level language that is its own family, and with a design that is radically different from either C or C++; it&#x27;s hard to compare it to anything, really. Zig goes well beyond C in its power of abstraction to match C++&#x2F;Rust, but it does so in a very different way than C++&#x2F;Rust.')
