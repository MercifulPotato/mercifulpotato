Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25393303], score=None, time=1607715557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389375, text='a &quot;9&#x2F;11&quot; is not some standard unit of death that can be compared to any other death toll to compute a value for &quot;how much should we care?&quot;. comparing covid deaths to having 9&#x2F;11s every day ignores almost all the context for why we care so much about 9&#x2F;11 in the first place. without context, 3000 deaths is just not that much for a country of ~300 million. it&#x27;s a lot to have in a single day, but it&#x27;s only about half of what we expect under normal circumstances. it is a really large number of people to lose in a day to a single disease, but it&#x27;s not comparable to the deliberate killing of 3000 civilians in a novel terror attack.<p>this kind of comparison serves only to provoke an emotional response; it doesn&#x27;t contribute to a reasonable conversation about mitigations and tradeoffs. at best, it might serve as a critique of the US reaction to 9&#x2F;11 itself.')
