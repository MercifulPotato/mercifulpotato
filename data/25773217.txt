Probably not, because local legislators as well as the public would have said &quot;whoa, we&#x27;re not doing THAT!&quot; I mean, Belgium outright banned Facebook from collecting data a few years ago, and there are other cases as well.<p>Companies such as Intel and Microsoft have been repeatedly fined, and it&#x27;s not hard to see how they would have ben prevented getting in such a position in the first place if they had been started in Europe.<p>Now, according to some viewpoints profit and size is everything; I&#x27;ve seen this expressed on HN a few times with comments such as &quot;all tech giants are American, Europe is shit&quot;, but what this misses is the question if we&#x27;re <i>really</i> better off with all these tech giants in the first place, because to be honest I&#x27;m not so sure that we are. I think quite a few Europeans would see the existence of these companies as a <i>failure</i> of the American system, rather than a success.<p>So <i>part</i> of the reason is that the US allows for some business practices that would be very difficult (or outright illegal) if a company would be EU-based.')
