Being angry at some injustice doesn&#x27;t automatically make you unhappy too, if the anger is used constructively and positively. You can voice your concern and be practical too.<p>The article is actually quite well written and even highlights, with examples, how Apple applies such naming rules arbitrarily.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before - all developers who distribute their apps through the macOS &#x2F; ios app store should feel like a JACKASS for not only giving Apple control over distribution, but also paying them for the same. YOU DEVELOPERS ARE THE ONE WHO CREATE MORE VALUE FOR THESE APPLE PLATFORMS - why in the hell do you think it is some kind of &quot;privilege&quot; to PAY them for it??<p>With its exclusive app store, Apple acts like a CORRUPT bureaucrat who unnecessarily imposes himself in the middle of you and your clients, demanding a bribe from both to connect you and them. Thus, increasing costs for your clients, and reducing your profits!<p>Especially on the macOS, which Apple is desperately trying to turn into a closed platform like ios, developers are being incredibly SHORT-SIGHTED by distributing apps on its app store and adding more value to something that will end up hurting them when everyone&#x27;s choice is ultimately limited to it.')
