Practically, you&#x27;d never find out who did it unless they admitted to it, happen to live in the same country, etc etc etc.<p>I think the saying &quot;it&#x27;s only a crime if you get caught&quot; is applicable in this case.<p>That said, you can get charged with tax evasion if you have crypto without reporting it.
