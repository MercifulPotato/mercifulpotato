Sooo many elements had to be replaced&#x2F;adjusted due to rattling, creaking, falling off, had to have the entire gearbox replaced after a year. Would not recommend, not for this amount of money anyway. Btw, it had nothing to do with relability - apart from the gearbox issue, it was very reliable, just <i>extremely</i> poorly put together.<p>I&#x27;ve had this XC60 since brand new for a year now and literally had zero issues with it. Nothing.')
