The stresses a battery undergoes during supercharging are incredible and, as far as I am aware, there is no fool proof way to make sure things are in good enough condition. Tesla is relying on the initial construction of the battery pack for supercharging safety - it only takes one cell with damage to overheat and cause a cascade to nearby cells.
