I never see ads on youtube from my desktop, and I don&#x27;t use youtube on phone. When a friend wants to show me some youtube video they like on their phone, its always a bit of shock how annoying those ads are. I don&#x27;t have any premium account, just usual set of blockers.<p>I&#x27;ve became super allergic to ads generally quite some years ago, not watching any channel on TV, just movies&#x2F;tv shows streamed from PC. Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t go back, ever.')
