Item(by='amzans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606153054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188886, text='I have used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calculator.aws&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calculator.aws&#x2F;</a> in the past, but to be honest it&#x27;s difficult to account for the egress costs&#x2F;networking fees using their calculator. Simple things like networking between Availability Zones&#x2F;Regions can really creep up in your monthly bills if you don&#x27;t watch out.<p>I do track my expenses on a sheet manually, using a ballpark figure. At the end of the month I compare it with my AWS bill. If something seems off, I investigate it further. But I don&#x27;t try to predict exact figures, more like expected ranges.<p>I do miss the fixed-cost nature of DigitalOcean&#x2F;Linode. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about sudden charges, you pay $20&#x2F;mo per node and that&#x27;s it. Lots of bandwidth included.<p>But for the most part it&#x27;s fine, as long no bot starts bombarding your services with useless requests, egress costs tend to scale with revenue in my case, as my product&#x27;s pricing is based on usage.<p>I also have Cloudflare in front of my AWS stack, it has blocked a few small attacks already, but nothing serious yet.')
