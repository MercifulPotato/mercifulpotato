This is a symptom of how divided society is on divisive topics. People disagree, but they don&#x27;t believe that the disagreements are legitimate. For a site like HN, accusations like what you posted are much more toxic than the problem you&#x27;re complaining about. There&#x27;s tons of past explanation here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=by:dang%20astroturf&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=true&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=by:dang%20astroturf&amp;sort=byDat...</a><p>Before anyone comes out with &quot;dang says astroturfing doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;â€”no, the point is that there are two problems: real astroturfing, and imaginary internet accusations about it. Anyone assuming only the former is making a huge mistake. So what&#x27;s the solution? Obviously we have to try to distinguish between the one and the other based on some sort of objective evidence. It&#x27;s not enough to dislike someone else&#x27;s view on a difficult topic like Covid and then say &quot;brigading!&quot;')
