You naturally would have to count every last input cost for any kind of meaningful comparison. The restaurants certainly are when pricing their food.<p>&gt; Adding all that up and doubling it brings us to $6000 in construction costs.<p>For, say, a 150 sq.ft. kitchen (the average sized kitchen)? Which means if we theoretically placed 10 of those rooms side by side, totalling 1,500 sq.ft., you could build what is essentially an entire house for $60,000? I realize that doesn&#x27;t include all the fixtures, but it still seems quite low. Labour must be pretty cheap where you&#x27;re from.')
