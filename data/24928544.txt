Even though it&#x27;s pretty much confirmed it&#x27;s not a real audio signal coming from outside of a person&#x27;s body, there isn&#x27;t quite enough evidence it isn&#x27;t a real auditory sensation for these people (instead of psychological or &quot;paranormal&quot; issue).<p>I do get the hum sometimes, usually happens when my shoulders are tense. Also usually only in one ear, which is why I was able to pretty quickly rule out an external source (though when it first happened, I did spend some time opening and closing windows, listening at ventilation ducts, trying to locate it).<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll add it here that sometimes it is a real sound. We live a couple of km away from a harbor, and the sound we get to our place from an idling cruise liner is very similar to what my ears sometimes generate by themselves. It&#x27;s really hard to tell them apart except by trying if it gets louder (and more high freq components) by opening a window. The point is, at least in an urban environment it can be pretty hard to tell if the hum is real or not.')
