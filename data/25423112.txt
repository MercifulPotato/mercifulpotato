One person works on it four hours a day, the other six. They both get it done on time, at the same level of quality. The first person was actually _more_ productive than the second.<p>I&#x27;d argue that they were equally productive.  To be more productive, they&#x27;d have to produce <i>more work product</i> during the week.<p>Especially if it&#x27;s a primarily mental task, there&#x27;s a good chance that the 4-hour &#x2F; day person is actually making progress when they&#x27;re not visibly working, which would interfere with any attempts to either move the deadline earlier or get other work done in parallel.')
