Those usually cannot be corrected by another optimization pass over the code.<p>It is much more effective and efficient to have a good plan before you start, and make sure not to write inefficient code in the beginning.<p>It is also much more effective to take the lessons you learned from the first round, throw the code from that round away, and write a new version. However that is only an option if you modularized your project well, so that small modules are replacable without endangering the rest of the project. Writing the new version will go much faster because you now understand the problem better, and it will produce better code because you get rid of questionable design decisions that hold you back in the long term.<p>Think about what your legacy in this world will be.<p>Leave the world with better software than you found it with!')
