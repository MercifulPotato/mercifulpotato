But at the end of the day, the world needs a lot of vaccine. It&#x27;s better to have Pfizer&#x2F;Moderna <i>and</i> the Oxford vaccine at our disposal, particularly when the latter is also much cheaper and easier to store (this will be crucial in developing countries and&#x2F;or rural populations). What matters is having fewer people get sick or die, not ensuring everyone is given the vaccine with the greatest efficacy.')
