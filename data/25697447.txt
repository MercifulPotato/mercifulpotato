Spending resources campaigning in California so that it goes to the Democrats by 54 to 46 instead 65 to 35 is a losing strategy, so they don&#x27;t.<p>But then that&#x27;s why the popular vote numbers come out the way they do. If you actually abolished the electoral college, suddenly the foregone conclusion states would matter, everybody&#x27;s campaign strategy would change and so would all the numbers.<p>The people the electoral college <i>actually</i> underrepresents are the people of California and Massachusetts. But also Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, etc. The people it overrepresents are the people of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc. The swing states. Because they&#x27;re the only people whose vote can plausibly change the outcome, so they&#x27;re the only people whose concerns politicians care to address.<p>Which means you can pretty easily end up in a situation where people from deep red states feel underrepresented, because in practice they are. The same as the people from deep blue states.')
