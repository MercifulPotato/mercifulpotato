Discord basically does everything Slack does (rich-media real time chat with a specific group of contacts.) It&#x27;s far easier to crank out a new discord for your friends and you don&#x27;t get slammed with the &quot;Free Organization&quot; restrictions that come with Slack.<p>This is what I often point to in Discord&#x27;s favor. Slack&#x27;s business model is at the &quot;team&quot;&#x2F;&quot;group&quot; level and makes the most sense for organizations with a strong cohesive identity over time, whereas Discord&#x27;s business model is at the individual user level and allows for a lot more ephemeral friend groups to flow in&#x2F;out of &quot;servers&quot; (teams&#x2F;groups&#x2F;what have you) as makes sense to them.')
