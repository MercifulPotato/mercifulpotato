Similar to an anti-smoker, ex-cult member, ex-mormon or vegan convert - those who have been burnt are often the loudest. The same psychological effects are in play - people will try to defend the hurt to their ego.<p>There is no brand of &quot;anti-Apple&quot; - that doesn&#x27;t really exist as brands don&#x27;t work like that BUT groups of people do though, and people can have identities of being in a group. (I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed an anti-apple subreddit either)<p>One way groups defend themselves is to define the opposition - by defining the opposition to Apple fans as anti-apple-groups, it helps bolster the coherence of the Apple fan group and defend the brand and investment for the individual. We are under attack, close ranks and protect each other.')
