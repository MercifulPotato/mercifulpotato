It&#x27;s a huge performance hit. Mobile doesn&#x27;t do it. And RAM is so cheap.)<p>A small swap area (like half a gig) can give a useful indicator of too much memory use that can be hard to get otherwise. If your disk paging hits a certain rate, or you hit 50% used, or rapid growth, you have a problem you need to solve right away. Sometimes that gives you enough time to move load and avoid a messy OOM death.')
