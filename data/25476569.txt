Private Eye, however, did, and <i>their</i> report is free online: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.private-eye.co.uk&#x2F;special-reports&#x2F;justice-lost-in-the-post" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.private-eye.co.uk&#x2F;special-reports&#x2F;justice-lost-i...</a> -- Private Eye was very good at banging the drum for many years and eventually the mainstream media cottoned on and -- following <i>that</i> -- several miscarriages of justice were reversed.<p>Note that in Britain, following a Tory amendment to the law, you can only get legal aid if you have assets less then Â£37.5k -- so if you own a home, and are charged (incorrectly!) with criminal proceedings, which you then win, expect to sell it to pay the legal bills. Once you win, you&#x27;ll get...nothing. No fees. Just a &quot;release the defendant from the dock&quot; and you&#x27;re good to go. If you get imprisoned, and THEN are found innocent later on, maybe, say, 30 years later (as has happened!) expect to get....nothing.  I really recommend &quot;The Secret Barrister&quot; both as a book and a blog. Nobody stands up for funding criminal justice properly -- because what politician wants to support the rights of the accused? -- but it&#x27;s badly breaking. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesecretbarrister.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;02&#x2F;mr-gove-must-now-hammer-the-final-nail-into-graylings-legacy-and-abolish-the-innocence-tax&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesecretbarrister.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;02&#x2F;mr-gove-must-now-h...</a>')
