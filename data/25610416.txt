However, I find it hard to stomach tossing out the ~$10k worth of crap that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years so that I can move abroad -- even though I&#x27;ve heard from my friends that top companies have ludicrous signing bonuses that can allow me to replace everything.<p>Maybe once Covid is finally under control in a year or two, I&#x27;ll be able to overcome my personal bias. For now, I&#x27;ll focus on studying foreign languages in my spare time and avoid impulse buying.')
