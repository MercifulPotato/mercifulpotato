Then each supervisors are supposed to report how complete each package under their control is.<p>Problem is, this can sometimes be a little tricky and the supervisors often fudge the numbers to smooth out how their works look. Ie, they may have done 50% of the work, but will only claim 20% because they know that the last 50% worth of the claim card will actually take way longer. They don&#x27;t want to look bad at the end of each week cause the estimators did a shit job. So they&#x27;ll take their gains and average them out.<p>A system that was more automatic and had way more compliance built in would be cool to see. I doubt however, that an algorithm could solve what is predominately an issue of people and estimation.')
