At least that&#x27;s what I see in our RWA (Indian for HOA) in Bangalore: if we hire a contractor, we have to make sure all the right stuff is mentioned in the contract about labourer safety. I never cross-checked this, and I don&#x27;t know the law in this case, but it seems to be a thing. And IMHO, it&#x27;s a good thing if the law requires it.')
