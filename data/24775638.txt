This might be true with dramas where the plot is a big component of it, but certainly not for episodic comedies.<p>Yeah, the Simpsons isn&#x27;t something I care to watch anymore, and the Office&#x27;s final seasons without Michael Scott weren&#x27;t as good. But I&#x27;d still much rather have more episodes of content I enjoy than less for the sake of &quot;the complete package&quot;. It sucks when a show gets cancelled without an end, but while we&#x27;re here, the American Office had a fine ending and I&#x27;m much happier with the many seasons of it over the British one.')
