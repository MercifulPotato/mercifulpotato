If my family was killed by a bombing attack I would want to get to the bottom of why it happened in the first place without just blaming an entire population and justifying their genocide.<p>I am not saying that jihadist extremism is not to blame. But I don&#x27;t think an entire Uighur culture is to blame either and especially not Uighur people who are being victimised.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not saying either side was right. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s wrong to comment on how this is disgusting.<p>It&#x27;s not wrong at all to comment on this. What the Chinese govt is doing is plain disgusting and they should be held accountable just like anybody who is supporting them. We hold extremist groups who carry out attacks responsible, so why not a racist, genocidal govt who instigated the whole thing anyway?')
