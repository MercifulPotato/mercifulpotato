High end consumer routers will allow you to select these frequencies, and usually there&#x27;s no nearby interference.<p>I have ~70 nearby networks visible but none on my DFS channel. Your signal can drop if the AP detects radar but unless you&#x27;re near a weather radar station or airport it works fine IMO')
