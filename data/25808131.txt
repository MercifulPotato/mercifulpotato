I wish I did, but I just don&#x27;t.<p>I can explain to you what our configs do, but if you asked me to make it do something else it&#x27;d be straight to google for examples to mangle, a metric tonne of trial and error, and lookups for simple groovy syntax that I keep forgetting in-between the actual work I want to do.')
