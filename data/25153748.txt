Item(by='ciarannolan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605816348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25153611, text='&gt; Aggressive moderation on some subs makes it hard to post. Posts might be deleted for arbitrary reasons. Sometimes questions are sent to a generic &#x27;Ask a Question&#x27; thread, which isn&#x27;t great for finding questions later via search.<p>This is my biggest problem with the site, and the reason I don&#x27;t use it. Each community is at the mercy of a small number of moderators who are free to shape the conversation in any way they wish.<p>There&#x27;s also a small number of people that control what is posted and commented on in all the main, default subreddits (news, politics, technology, etc). Browsing reddit is just ingesting the information diet of a small number of ideological moderators.')
