But given we already have a moderation, will it require any fundamental changes to add tags?<p>There are IMO some valid reasons for wanting tags:<p>* Filtering: Eg: I don&#x27;t want to see political stories and would want more technology related stories instead. One may also want to not see stories about any particular topic.<p>* Searching: When I search for topics about programming, Google often results lot of clickbaity shallow results which don&#x27;t go in depth. Say I am searching for Go language. Almost everything on Google is 4 bullet point lists with slightly different content. Signal to noise ratio is much better with human filters. I&#x27;d prefer to once gloss over results on relevant subreddits, HN and lobsters. That&#x27;s likely to give some in depth links than Google search. But on HN search sometimes keywords will be differing between submissions. IMO tags give better discoverability.<p>Though, tbh the main reason I would like tags is filtering out political-leaning stories.<p>Apologies if it sounds like I think I am entitled to something. There may be valid reasons @pg &#x2F; @dang would&#x27;ve kept this feature away. I would be interested to know the reason as well.')
