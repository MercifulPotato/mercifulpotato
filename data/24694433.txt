The beginning of a book essentially sets up &quot;promises&quot; for what the rest of the book is going to be like. In the case of <i>Leviathan Wakes</i>, I think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to see the book as making a promise that it&#x27;s hard sci-fi, given that it&#x27;s trying <i>so</i> hard to be. All of the little details, like you say, are made very obvious in the beginning.<p>And then, you get a good ways into the book, and suddenly you realize that it&#x27;s not really hard sci-fi after all. It can be a serious let-down since the book was leading you on to believe it was fully hard sci-fi.<p>Now I&#x27;m not actually a huge fan of hard sci-fi per se, but this did irritate me that I didn&#x27;t bother to pick up any of the sequels. Maybe I&#x27;ll get back to it some day, since I do think some of the almost-hard details are nice, and now that I know to set the right expectations.')
