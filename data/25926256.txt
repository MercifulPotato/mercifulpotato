They had previously had a big result that they could stimulate this behaviour in defined, serum-free culture by adding a specific factor.<p>Friend was to work on characterising this effect, so his first job was to reproduce the result as a base case. He couldn&#x27;t. The factor didn&#x27;t stimulate the behaviour.<p>He asked around, comparing his execution of the protocol with that of the the postdoc who had done the original work.<p>The method involved growing a feeder layer of cells, in serum, then lysing them and washing the plate, leaving a serum-free layer of extracellular matrix behind, as a foundation for the serum-free cell culture (this is a pretty standard technique).<p>Turns out the previous postdoc&#x27;s idea of washing a plate was a lot less thorough than my friend&#x27;s. Couple of quick changes of PBS. So they were almost certainly leaving a lot of serum factors behind on the matrix. Their serum-free culture was nothing of the sort.<p>The supervisor insisted that the previous postdoc&#x27;s work was fine, and that my friend just didn&#x27;t have good technique. The supervisor had him repeat this work for months in an attempt to make it work. But he&#x27;s a careful worker, so it never did.')
