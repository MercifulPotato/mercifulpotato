Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25566970], score=None, time=1609209451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560179, text='When people talk about &quot;using land productively&quot;, they aren&#x27;t talking about a single person&#x27;s profit.  It&#x27;s more of a &quot;collective productivity&quot;.<p>You can only pass on so many costs before demand drops because the price you&#x27;re asking just isn&#x27;t feasible.<p>Non-resident landlords in SF, to my knowledge, aren&#x27;t really anti-development.  They recognize that 2x the number of units on the same parcel of land won&#x27;t cut the per-unit rent in half, so higher density is still a better deal.<p>The problem, from the individual landlord&#x27;s perspective, is that they can&#x27;t redevelop their own land without triggering a tax reassessment, which can easily turn any profit into a loss, even after adjusting rent for the newly-developed property.  The landlords who are making out like bandits right now are the ones who have owned their properties for decades. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a duplex or a quad-plex in SF right now with the intention to rent it out; the cost of the property, plus 2020-assessed property taxes, would mean I&#x27;d barely break even at market rates (pre-pandemic market rates; current market rates might be a solid operating loss).<p>Large developers that are coming in and wanting to build apartment or condo complexes essentially <i>have</i> to build so-called &quot;luxury units&quot;, because the economics won&#x27;t work out otherwise, when you take into account high initial property taxes and the high, drawn-out cost of just building in SF.')
