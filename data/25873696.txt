And, like anything, I tend to have a strong directional preference for neutrality but consider religious adherence suboptimal (nb: suboptimality can still be the best of all politically feasible worlds).<p>There are at least two ways that an &quot;it depends&quot; answer can make a lot of sense.<p>The first reason I could support violating net neutrality is related to the purpose and nature of the discrimination. For example, should ISPs be allowed to differentiate based on the <i>type</i> of data? There&#x27;s a reasonable rationale for answering &quot;yes&quot; -- e.g., to prioritize video-conferencing traffic over entertainment platforms during the 9-5 work day. Or to strictly prioritize the provisioning of essential services (eg education or tele-health). Something like that could be pretty reasonable in places with limited bandwidth. However, actually implementing this would probably require -- or at least be made substantially easier by -- discriminating based upon the source of the data. The important point is not necessarily the mechanism, but rather the intent and a good-faith effective effort to keep things fair and underpinned by public-good policy objectives.<p>The second reason I could support violating net neutrality is related to the structure of the market. Consider a world where ISPs were just overlays on separately owned networks -- with the underlying infra owner (perhaps gov) required to be neutral toward intermediary ISPs <i>including in the last mile!</i>. This is how electrical utilities work in some states. I think getting rid of consumer-facing net neutrality regs would make a lot more sense in this case. If there&#x27;s always a vanilla neutral network access option, and if all competitors pay the same for use of the wires, then why shouldn&#x27;t Consumer Facing Provider Co. be allowed to eg partner with Netflix to place a small data center at the edge and save on upstream bandwidth? Seems reasonable.<p>The reason I am directionally supportive of net neutrality in the USA is because I have absolutely zero trust in the structure of the market or the good will of the actors within that market.')
