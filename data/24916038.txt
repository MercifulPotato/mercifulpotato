The hobby certainly attracts a higher than average level of fuckwits. (And I may well be kidding myself presuming I&#x27;m not one of them.)<p>I like to think you&#x27;d rarely even notice me on the road though, I&#x27;m rarely flamboyant or behaving unexpectedly in traffic (even though pre-covid I commuted every day by bike), and my rule-breaking (these days at least, I will admit for being stupider when younger) is mostly reserved for non main highway out of town backroads, or late night&#x2F;early morning mostly empty roads.')
