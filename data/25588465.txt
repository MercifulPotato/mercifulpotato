I am not speaking in absolutes I am simply responding to you. Now you know. I led with an &quot;educational moment&quot; because it still remains accurate that the amount of energy is not a strong argument without referencing the source of the energy. It&#x27;s not controversial for you to disagree with that, a reality still was and now is with mining included that energy producers opted to not transport some energy across long distances and miners are overwhelmingly using that because it is economical for both parties. You read something else that I didn&#x27;t say or imply. You keep referring to that, which I was willing to ignore. It&#x27;s clear snark is important to you, now you got your reaction so I hope you feel satisfactorily accomplished in that regard.<p>Now let&#x27;s talk about your unique points than the original person I replied to: places have had decades to send more power over power lines and they didn&#x27;t. You tell me why that is. I assume there were financial reasons and related impracticalities. But admittedly I have never asked and only react to the reality that energy producers have been receptive to the additional use of their energy for the aforementioned reasons I listed. Their output hasn&#x27;t changed and to them it is a more efficient use of it. Are they lying? Are they ignorant of alternatives? Just lazy even though their laziness would therefore predate crypto mining?<p>Either way mining on premise is an immediately applicable economic incentive that simply got you to notice that you didn&#x27;t like it.<p>Best case scenario then is that it gets you into action to implement a solution nobody else noticed was applicable. Society might be getting somewhere because of you, that&#x27;s so exciting.')
