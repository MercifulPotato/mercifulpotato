Hide the restaurants that pay and increase exposure of those that donâ€™t to these reviewers to get them to give poor ratings.<p>Obviously there is no way to prove this, but it would be a great way to get people to pay while still maintaining plausible deniability. After all, the one star reviewers still have to go to the establishment and have their bad experience.')
