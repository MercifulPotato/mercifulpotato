You know, there is a principle of traffic engineering that says: First to come first to be served.  That means, if you are using the road, and you find a slower vehicle in front of you you are not allowed to run over him or kick him out of the way in any way. You are allowed to pass if safe to do so or just wait behind if not safe.')
