It&#x27;s also completely wrong to say that those themes are written as an end unto themselves, that reads to me like pretty much the exact opposite of the book. I&#x27;ll presume you read it since you&#x27;re offering such a strong critique, so I&#x27;d be curious to understand why you think this way.')
