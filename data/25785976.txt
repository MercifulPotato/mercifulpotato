Physics has had a tradition of interest in programming that goes back decades. We&#x27;ve always had &quot;big data,&quot; meaning big relative to the tools available at any given moment. We ran out of problems that could be solved by pencil and paper in the 1930s.<p>Every physics student at my college had to take FORTRAN, plus programming was assumed in many of the other courses, and we also took an electronics course that included digital techniques. And maybe the main thing was simply that programming was interesting and fun.<p>We&#x27;ve also had a tradition of learning to do everything ourselves, for better or worse. I had no access to a professional programmer.')
