I will repeat once again.  The person who I was responding to said  &quot; you&#x27;re no worse off than you were before&quot;.<p>This statement is not true, and I have explained exactly how I would be worse off.<p>I would be worse off in that now I have to give money to the union, and I now have to be represented by their deals, and I don&#x27;t want that.  That is how I am worse off.<p>I don&#x27;t care about your moral arguments.  Instead I care about what hurts or helps me.')
