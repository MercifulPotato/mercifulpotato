A sports game is also the wrong analogy because sports games have very clearly defined rules, specifically to avoid referees picking winners.<p>Have you ever watched sports? The referee always has an impact whether they blow the whistle or not. Every rule requires some level of interpretation or fitting to a given situation. Some sports (mainly soccer) don&#x27;t have rules, they explicitly have &quot;laws of the game&quot; because it&#x27;s understood that they are to be interpreted.<p>&gt; That approach is incoherent: the whole point of capitalist competition is that the better firm in some sense harms the weaker firm by taking away its customers. And giving the referee the power to transfer money from the competitors to their own pockets at will, without needing to convince anyone else at all, is clearly an enormous conflict of interest.<p>...you know regulators don&#x27;t get to keep any money right? Their job is to set market rules, enforce them, and break up any competitor who gains too much market power. Where exactly is the conflict of interest? Historically, most shareholders wind up making more money off the future value of the broken-up interests than they did with the original conglomerate.<p>It seems like you are arguing from an EU standpoint, and I don&#x27;t know anything about their antitrust history, so I&#x27;m not going to try and defend or interpret what Europe does.')
