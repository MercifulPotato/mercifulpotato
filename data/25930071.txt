At least buy a put or something instead.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is actually long on gamestop at $350 per share, but trying to short is not about company expectations at this point, it&#x27;s about timing this hysteria wave, and if you mistime it you get destroyed by infinite risk and your broker liquidate your position and you leave with not 10k, but -100k.')
