Personally, though, I think Paper is excellent. It&#x27;s the first document-authoring tool I&#x27;ve spent much time with that understands that most of what we write will be consumed on (variably-sized) screens rather than in print, and yet is still accessible to less-technical folks. My sense, though, from our experience, was that it&#x27;s pretty polarizing, and some people strongly prefer something more like Word.')
