When their computers broke, his team had to pay their support staff to get them fixed. (Via internal budgeting). But the support team knew internal customers would call them anyway and it was still compaq’s money, so they charged several times more for internal support calls than normal support calls.<p>My uncle’s team was having none of that, so they paid an external computer repair service to fix their computers. The external repair service subcontracted to compaq’s internal people anyway, so when their computers broke they called up (and paid) external consultants. Who in turn called compaq’s internal support team, who came downstairs and fixed their computers at a competitive price.')
