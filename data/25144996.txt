What I&#x27;m trying to do is to gain an intuition of what kind of objects GA manipulates, then stash it for whenever I&#x27;ll need that kind of manipulation, which, sadly, can be never.<p>Within that context, just grokking R^2 or R^3 would be great progress. To be fair, the article <i>does</i> present the fundamental identity, uv = u.v + u &#x2F;\\ v, where u.v is the usual dot product (scalar denoting relative projective size) and u &#x2F;\\ v = |u||v|sinθi (something related to area and the plane induced by u and v). Even if the article does exemplify with R^2 by defining i = xy, and then dropping the ball: &quot;i is interpreted to mean the plane generated by x and y&quot;. I can&#x27;t grok this part :(<p>* This looks like (almost) a circular definition, defining uv in terms of the specific xy, where x and y are the two orthonormal R^2 vectors forming the basis. What <i>is</i> xy? Is it a scalar? A vector? A normal vector? How does a normal vector work in R^2?. A tensor of some dimensions? For example, assuming x = (1,0) and y = (0,1), how does one compute i = xy?<p>* Plane generated how? a u + b v, given any two scalars a and b?<p>* When moving to R^3, i&#x27;d think uv &#x2F; xy define a plane. What does uvw &#x2F; xyz mean?<p>* Minor quibble, is it sin(θ * i) or sin(θ) * i?')
