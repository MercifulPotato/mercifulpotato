In March, R was 3-5 without restrictions.<p>If everyone got vaccinated with 90% effectivity (or even 70%), it would be enough. However, availability won&#x27;t be sufficient to get to 100% within a year, and compliance seems to be somewhere around 50-70% at most given polls. (There are a huge number of people even in this forum who are antisocial - &quot;I won&#x27;t get vaccinated until I have seen super-long-term effects, and screw the people who I superspread the disease to&quot;.)')
