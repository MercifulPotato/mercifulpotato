But the issue is that it&#x27;s not just about specific examples but about the overall drift in perspective, production of fear and slooow but steady changes. From my understanding that&#x27;s exactly one of the points the OP article touched uppon: \nIf you ask for specific examples of bad changes I can name a few and you can justfy each of them in one way or another. But the sum of it all points to a really bad outcome from which we all be looking back in a few years and will wonder how we got there.<p>Actually the downvotes my original comment receives demonstrate the exact behavior the OP article describes.')
