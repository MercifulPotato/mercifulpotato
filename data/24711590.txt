Mobile networks break TCP connections all the time, it just violates too many useful assumptions of TCP.<p>HTTP&#x2F;3&#x27;s WebTransport (i.e. gRPC + sessions) defines a Session far more logically than a TCP Connection + your ad-hoc in-application Session does.<p>The predecessors of WebTransport already appear every everywhere in low-latency and realtime networked applications, like games, chat and video, on mobile devices. Typically that is achieved using UDP + an ad-hoc session management and authentication protocol. Or worse, undoing TCP connections and managing sessions on top of TCP connection breaks (as most dual web + native applications do).<p>Why reinvent that clumsy stuff over and over again instead of having it standardized? TCP is already dead on mobile, for many of the most popular applications people actually use.')
