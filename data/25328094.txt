You don&#x27;t guarantee to fans personally that the game will definitely come out at a date (which is less than a month away) then delay it the next day.<p>This indicates that nobody even knew how bad it was. There&#x27;s also rumors developers found out about the delays from social media.<p>CDPR execs are just incompetent and unable to set realistic timelines. When big AAA releases are delayed, they&#x27;re usually delayed once and it&#x27;s done 6+ months from release (because it&#x27;s obvious then you won&#x27;t make it).<p>Delaying when it&#x27;s less than a month out? Absolute incompetence. You lose millions and millions of dollars doing this, by burning marketing dollars and screwing over your retail partners.')
