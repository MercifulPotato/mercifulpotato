It can be reduced to, &quot;if it were a public spat, it would be a public spat.&quot; Hope I&#x27;m not being uncharitable here.<p>Apple didn&#x27;t advertise they were dropping FortNite.  It was not on the front of the App Store (outside of conspicuously recommending competitors). Apple only released legal and policy statements. These are only warranted when there are policy infractions Apple wants to enforce (eg violating App Store Guidelines).  Dropping Bose or Sonos was not due to policy infractions, anymore than Walmart dropping Amazon products is.  There is a fundamental difference between &quot;We dropped this product for economic reasons, but it may return&quot; and &quot;We have banned this product because it violates the policies and terms we have set  out, and it is no longer welcome.&quot;<p>Apple _has_ to respond to policy infractions.  Otherwise they&#x27;re effectively abandoning the policy.
