A value judgement. It&#x27;s not subject to refutation.<p>&gt; Is that an argument that an ACLU lawyer would accept for other contentious issues, like abortion or gun control? That it&#x27;s a hot legislative issue and therefore wrongthink on that subject should be suppressed?<p>The ACLU has never opposed private action to oppose and discourage publication or distribution of views that a private actor views as unwelcome, in fact, were there state action to suppress such private action, the ACLU would likely defend it as the essential component of free speech that it is. The action at issue here is exactly that kind of private action.')
