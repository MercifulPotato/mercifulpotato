In the latest quarterly letter, Mr Klarmen referred to the Fed as an “800-pound gorilla” that has priced out investors who typically provide liquidity in moments of distress.<p>“The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount,” he said.<p>Mr Klarmen also said the Fed policies had exacerbated economic inequality, referring to a “K” shaped recovery that has seen “the fortunes of those already at the top bounding swiftly upward, while those at the bottom remain on a downslope without end”.<p>Using Tesla as an example, Mr Klarman said shares in the “barely profitable” electric carmaker had soared “seemingly beyond all reason”, briefly making the company’s founder Elon Musk the richest person in the world. Low interest rates have made projected cash flows more valuable, he said, a point many investors have unwisely used to justify valuations on companies that sit far above historic norms.<p>“The more distant the eventual pay-off, the more the present value rises,” he wrote. “When it comes to the value of cash flows, the vast and limitless future, yet to unfold, has gained considerable ground on the more firmly anchored present.”<p>The Fed’s policies and programmes “have directly contributed to exceptionally benign market conditions where nearly everything is bid up while downside volatility is truncated”, he added. “The market’s usual role in price discovery has effectively been suspended.”<p>Mr Klarman said investors were now in a constant hunt for yield that was driving them to riskier corners of the markets, including investment grade corporate debt, private credit or junk bonds.<p>The Fed’s drastic measures had helped to boost economic activity and rescue ailing businesses, Mr Klarmen said. “But they have also kindled two dangerous ideas: that fiscal deficits don’t matter, and that no matter how much debt is outstanding, we can effortlessly, safely, and reliably pile on more.” &#x2F;&#x2F;')
