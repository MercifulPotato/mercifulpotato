I take issue with the article stating:<p>&gt; Can I replace my Rails&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Flask already? Yup!<p>While I agree that you can try to replace Flask with Rust web frameworks, you can&#x27;t do it for Rails or Django. Rust web frameworks do not let you easily test your application&#x27;s database access layer nor provide advanced authorization, and lack other features that become necessary when your application becomes bigger.<p>If you don&#x27;t need the performance that Rust provides, you should still go for Django or Rails. Otherwise you will end up reinventing them.')
