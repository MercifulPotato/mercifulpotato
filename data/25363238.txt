For example, I&#x27;ve personally gotten the yellow fever vaccine, which is required to enter Kenya.<p>That vaccine is actually relatively risky. Yellow fever is a serious disease, and the vaccine from weakened - but not killed - yellow fever virus. Thus <i>very</i> occasionally it causes what&#x27;s basically yellow fever. That&#x27;s still much safer than the risk of getting yellow fever if you are visiting a place like Kenya. But at least where I live, doctors won&#x27;t give it to you without confirming where exactly you are travelling, because the otherwise the risk&#x2F;benefit tradeoff isn&#x27;t worth it.')
