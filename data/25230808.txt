It&#x27;s not a well kept secret either.<p>&gt; while the US and its allies (Israel and Saudi Arabia) have been waging constant war. (Israel vs. Palestine and Jordan &#x2F; Saudi Arabia against Yemen).<p>Are we talking about the same Israel?<p>Because for all their warts the Israelis are extremely restrictive and has been for a couple of decades even in the face of constant missile attacks, tunnel digging etc etc.<p>Even before that they have given away massive areas for peace agreements - and kept their part of the deal.<p>I agree Palestinians are in a rough spot, but lets not forget an almost equal amount of Israelis&#x2F;Jews were chased from their homes at the same time, and lets not forget that Israeli officials tried to get the locals to stay (because they were afraid to get carpet bombed if they were alone, but still.)')
