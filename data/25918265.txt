Something changed in the UI CSS such that some of my customizations around the bookmark bar no longer worked.  There seems to be a new option called &quot;Show Other Bookmarks&quot; that was enabled causing the entire bookmark bar to become one large clickable item.  Disabling that restored the bookmark bar functionality.  I&#x27;ll have to investigate my user CSS file to see if I can figure out what changed.')
