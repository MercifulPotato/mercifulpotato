They have, for example, much better results than any nation in Europe.<p>Now, this may not be due to Japan&#x27;s government; more plausibly, there is a higher level of pre-existing resistance to the virus, since all the nations of east Asia (including Australia and New Zealand) are doing better than all the nations of western Europe.
