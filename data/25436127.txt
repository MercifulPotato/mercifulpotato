Item(by='zug_zug', descendants=None, kids=[25438267], score=None, time=1608071386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435007, text='I was thinking about a similar scoring strategy for comments as is applied to articles. Articles which generate more comments than upvotes are deprioritized. Perhaps comments that garner more comments than upvotes could similarly be deprioritized (not unlike reddit penalizing controversial opinions [those with both upvotes &amp; downvotes] )<p>I&#x27;m envisioning a use-case for this would be when say, an article briefly touching on tech interviewing (or with a title about tech-interviewing) is posted, and immediately the top-comment changes the subject to &quot;Boy tech interwiews really grind my gears!&quot; Suddenly everyone wants to vent and the thread is overwhelmed.<p>One natural reason for this penalty is that a highly-ranked comment brings along all the comments that ride along with it to the top. The most extreme form is when the entire comment page is a single comment-thread.<p>Alternatively, a flexible proposal is to allow users to choose their sort preference, like they can on reddit.')
