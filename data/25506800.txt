Has it been working out for users?<p>Any thoughts on whether extending it to animated images might not&#x2F;work?  Might help with verbs?<p>Bigger picture, perhaps imagine a UI with two panes.  One the regular app.  And the other, a... bantering play space, where the app can do sciencey interactive jazz improv on what&#x27;s been said in the regular app.  Any feel for whether this would work, or be too distracting?  Has anyone seen something like this?')
