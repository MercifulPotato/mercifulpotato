To me it looks like choosing beggars, maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>Travis-CI was giving a ton of computing power for free, no questions asked. That was incredibly generous but had certainly a gigantic cost and it powered many OSS projects for a long time.<p>Yet how can we complain that they can throw money around, some says that it will reduce the number of new users that discover the service and the number of paying client in the long run (many are saying this but are not paying users anyway) but it&#x27;s not like the number of potential clients is unlimited anyway and at what point it becomes to costly to get the last ones.<p>Why would this be a &quot;private equity&quot; thing, you can&#x27;t always loose (or invest to get more users) money. Does your company sponsors the infrastructure of that many OSS projects? Would it be willing to cover the costs of all servers used by OSS projects for Travis?')
