It is not that I say we shouldnt learn from the successors of the culture, but isnt this post saying we should learn from that culture itself? To me (bringing back in the German example) it sounds like (trying to transfer the example) &#x27;learn how to get organized with nazi ideology&#x27;.<p>Adressing your first point, I really think that human (including children) sacrifice is quite unique and not present in the cultures you mentioned.')
