Item(by='black_puppydog', descendants=None, kids=[25135637], score=None, time=1605697296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135308, text='Yes, and from how I understand it, it is also a native app in android&#x2F;ios.<p>But I just checked on my Mobian install on the pinephone and that app looks <i>a lot</i> like the telegram web app. Which, by the way, is one of the best executions of webapps I&#x27;ve seen to date.<p>Edit:<p>I should clarify, I mean the telegram app that came <i>preinstalled</i> on mobian. There may be others that I&#x27;m not aware of. On ubports there were at least two IIRC<p>Edit 2:<p>And going by this GH issue [1] there is <i>in principle</i> no reason to not run the native QT app on the pinephone. Of course, I&#x27;m not sure how it would handle the sreen size etc. And it is only for the snaps apparently.<p>Edit 3: disregard edit 2, I&#x27;m stupid. Thanks to @linmob for the correction. :)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;telegramdesktop&#x2F;tdesktop&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5759" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;telegramdesktop&#x2F;tdesktop&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5759</a>')
