It&#x27;s only because things have escalated to the point of violence that it&#x27;s now so controversial.<p>Let me give an example to illustrate - suppose that Al Queda, or ISIS, or some other terrorist organization was using AWS or GCP. Would it be so controversial to refuse service to those organizations then? At the very least I don&#x27;t see why as private businesses they couldn&#x27;t decide that serving such organizations is too much risk to take on.')
