Over 30 years the rent will increase (as will taxes), but the payments stay the same.  Then the payments go to zero and you get a big payoff.  If you can&#x27;t commit to at least 30 years it is probably bad (you can change your mind as conditions change, but 30 years should be the plan) .<p>You want to share-crop for part of the price. It gives you incentive to ensure the farmer is farming the land as opposed to mining it for the nutrients before leaving you with dead land. Because you share some of the risk (and will have to cover it in bad years - there will be bad 5 year stretches so make sure you can budget for this!) you can get a greater return long term.')
