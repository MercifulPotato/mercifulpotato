I was expecting something different and maybe you agree that it would be a better visualization.<p>Right now, the visual experience is like watching movement through a high-speed tunnel. I was expecting the &quot;mandala&quot; you mentioned in the sense that the end result is the <i>accumulated</i> visualization of all waves.<p>The sound representation would not disappear out of the borders. The first sound recorded would be stored as a narrow outside ring right next to the circle limit. The next sound would be stored as another narrow ring right before the first one. And it would continuously being accumulated sound after sound. The final result would be like a tree cut. It would have a final image representation the whole song, not just sequential snapshots of the sounds included in the song as it is now.<p>Anyway, congrats for the project! It is awesome and inspiring!')
