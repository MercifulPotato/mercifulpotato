Pride in your culture and love for your community which you call nation. As things are, you get more exposed to a culture by physical proximity to the source. Therefore being born within a culture makes you knowledgeable of that culture. More likely to be proud of it. (Note, as an immigrant, I do not partake in nationalism in either my current country or origin country. Albeit, I like their cultures.)<p>Your idealism albeit commendable is far from reality. The world is unfair get over it.<p>Everyone wants better for themselves. And like the latest hacktoberfest showed, not everyone has the same culture (1). Therefore not everyone should live in close proximity. It would lead to a disruption of social harmony. Take for example those from a honor&#x2F;shame culture. They will literally beat you up for joking about their mother. Violence in the name of honor. In the West, that kind of violence is seen as outrageous. &quot;Be stoic about it&quot;. People from both cultures do not mix well unless they are willing to adapt.<p>I define human value as infinite. Also I am not responsible for the right treatment of those outside my sphere of control&#x2F;influence. I refuse to take responsibility for everyone. It is not up to me to give a better wage to an ungrateful immigrant. Life is unfair, get over it.<p>I agree. It is unfair that descendants of immigrants refuse to receive immigrants. As an immigrant that came to Canada, I am grateful for this opportunity. Also, I am grateful that those that would have not adapted to the Canadian mosaic of cultures were not allowed to come. I think another term is culture fit. If you do not fit the culture, you should not be allowed in.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24643894" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24643894</a>')
