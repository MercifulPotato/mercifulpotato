This is most likely what you want.<p>If you just fetch or cat a file, it will still put it in the local store but it will not pin it. However you still could serve that content until it is GCed from your local store.<p>Pinning is the action of getting the content into your local store and preventing it from being GCed in the future.<p>All that said, your point is still valid. Viewing a file is enough to also make you serve that content, and it&#x27;s very non obvious when you are and when it will be purged.')
