Rioters lighting buildings on fire (often with people inside), destroying private property, and attacking uninvolved civilians is a clear example.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that violent rioters are the targets here, not the more numerous peaceful protestors. It&#x27;s also a fact that violence is increasing, and not acknowledging that and saying it&#x27;s always peaceful isn&#x27;t useful to anyone.<p>As for your examples, a molotov cocktail is far more dangerous than rubber bullets and tear gas, and there seem to be no reports to corroborate your claims of disappearing people.')
