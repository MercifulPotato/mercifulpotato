Despite the memes about vim and emacs, I&#x27;d recommend learning Vim. Not because it&#x27;s better but because Vim, or Vi, is everywhere. And the way you <i>move</i> in vim can be enabled on the terminal.<p>type vimtutor into your terminal in any Linux box and you should get an interactive editor to teach you how to use vim. Do that. And please learn touch typing. I typed with 3 fingers for 15 years before teaching myself how to TouchType. It&#x27;s been a gift. I can type in the dark without Backlit keys. I can also use split ergonomic keyboards with ease.<p>keybr.com for learning.<p>Also, look up vimcasts for vim.<p>Two books I recommend is No Starch Press&#x27;s The Linux Command Line and How Linux Works. Both are always appearing on Humble Bundle and they&#x27;re worth the entire bundle.<p>Another thing I recommend is if you use VSCode, learn how to use the command bar. You get thst with control alt p or F1. Editors like this enable you to do everything through the command bar. It&#x27;s insane.<p>Additionally, learn stuff like how ctrl r can be used in your terminal to find older commands. Learn how to use your bashrc to set variables. How to debug PATH, and how to add to it.<p>Learn how installing Python through conda is better and easier to maintain on your dev box, and how installing stuff by sudo apt install is actually troublesome. I install everything by downloading and adding to path. It&#x27;s the best way to roll.<p>Also, one last thing. Remap your caps lock to escape. Learn to use your shift keys. Spare your pinky.<p>Hit me up on twitter if you need help. I use the same ID.')
