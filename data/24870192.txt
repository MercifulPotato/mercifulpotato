I just have a general aversion to subscriptions, they add up over time! And how many times do we need to repay for Office? I have probably bought it at least 5 times in the last 20 years, but that’s partly on me too for not being organized and transferring licenses over.<p>Storage imo is a non point since it’s very easy to get free or super cheap storage with a bit of searching.<p>My girlfriend used Dropbox for her business, I was horrified when I saw how much she was paying each month!<p>Moved over to google and her needs are covered in the free plan, so that’s a quality 50$ per month saved.<p>I’m not as rich as I used to be, so have really started to feel the pinch with all these subs, incl office which I don’t have anymore. Before I had the same view as you as it doesn’t feel like a lot. But given we’ve been paying for Office from 1990s onwards, you can see that Microsoft is milking it a fair bit given updates (whilst important, and very important in “enterprise” companies) are not that significant to justify paying for it every year.')
