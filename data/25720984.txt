Why wasn&#x27;t the FBI ready to swoop and arrest actual violent people given they were posting their plans in plane view? Why are we relying on AWS to moderate away trumps lies and fix the US Political landscape?<p>To me, killing parler (for all its shit-ness), is a perfect example of &quot;we have to do something, and this is something&quot;.<p>Does anyone actually think that if Parler had gone offline 4 weeks ago, the events of the last week would have been different? They&#x27;d have planned on twitter or Facebook or reddit or wherever.<p>When can we solve the actual problems here (failure to deal with trump, a poor relationship with the truth for all politicians, law enforcement complete lack of interest in right wing threats, lack of basic security etc)?<p>Censoring random websites seems like farting in a Jucuzzi, censorship is almost always a way of ignoring actual problems while pretending you are acting. And here we are again.<p>Sorry, its late here in the UK and I&#x27;m ranting. Thanks for reading.')
