When I was younger I used to play with Linux too, but now I do actually work I just need shit to work and macOS does that&#x27;, followed by a bunch of outdated, showing knows nothing about what they&#x27;re talking about shit about PulseAudio.<p>But when Apple completely and utterly screws up, to the point when you can&#x27;t even launch non-Apple apps on a machine you paid thousands of dollars for, then people are all too sudden overreacting?<p>Funny how that works.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m never going to buy a Windows computer. Period. I&#x27;m probably never going to switch to Linux either.<p>Good. And most FLOSS people don&#x27;t want you to either. What is my problem is when people have crazy high expectations of FLOSS maintainers, but a trillion dollar company screwing up is filled under the category of &#x27;shit happens&#x27; so to speak.<p>Especially considering Apple&#x27;s a commercial entity that DOES NOT and WILL NOT care about you or what you think and does not need anyone&#x27;s advocacy as they have a massive marketing budget of their own. Aside from that, there is a feeling in the FLOSS community that Apple&#x27;s conducting a war on general purpose computing as we know it, which is not an unreasonable thing to be fearful of considering their influence.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t go around shouting my reasons why I won&#x27;t,<p>I am glad to hear that, but there&#x27;s an awful number of your fellow Applers who are doing exactly the opposite.<p>&gt; But for a certain segment of the non-Apple crowd, yelling consistently about their opinions is an odd recurrence.<p>Right, which is totally not a thing for the Apple crowd, is that it?')
