Item(by='drusepth', descendants=None, kids=[25195370], score=None, time=1606192068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25193315, text='I had to pay two bribes (200 USD, then another 300 USD) to Cancun police to get a friend out of jail so he could make his flight home. They asked when his flight was (~3 days later), then said they&#x27;d hold him until the day after the flight unless I paid up. Definitely felt more like a ransom than a bribe in that I didn&#x27;t really have a choice not to pay.<p>I can definitely see how some people get suckered into bribes sometimes (especially with armed, intimidating police), but it doesn&#x27;t seem like that is the case here.')
