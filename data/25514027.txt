Maybe more like &quot;able&quot; to do, in the sense that you can violate other laws, and maybe the payoff or the risk&#x2F;reward ratio makes it worthwhile. My understanding of &quot;allow&quot; is that it means people will accept you doing something. The existence and enforcement (like fines) of rules that prohibit doing things seems exclusive to something being &quot;allowed&quot;.')
