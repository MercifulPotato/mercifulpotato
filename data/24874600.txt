If it used the one from Chrome, does everybody have to stop using Chrome? That seems problematic. Also, if that&#x27;s the case I foresee some epic trolling ahead as people incorporate &quot;interesting&quot; code into their overt piracy tools. I bet some of them even incorporate code built into Windows or macOS.<p>If not, what stops somebody from taking all of youtube-dl, changing the name and three lines of code, and saying that the removed lines were the ones promoted for infringement?')
