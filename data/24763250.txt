Usually, you cannot solve all problems for all people and you need to make trade offs.<p>Reinventing the wheel is really a bad analogy for this. A car wheel is not a substitute for a bicycle wheel, a bicycle wheel isn&#x27;t much good on a wheelbarrow, a wheel barrow doesn&#x27;t help out much on a skateboard, on and on and on. The act of inventing the wheel defined its parameters and necessary characteristics so that (mechanical) engineers could have them manufactured to their specifications as needed for the thing they were designing. If I design a new wheel it isn&#x27;t invention.<p>The similar &quot;fit for purpose&quot; notion in software is not widespread. Many of us somehow feel that implementation is more invention than manufacturing or design. The goodness of fit criteria are not often discussed or are difficult to define or measure. The things that sqlite can do that postgresql cannot and vice versa are important. They each leave some problems unsolved so that they can solve their chosen problems.')
