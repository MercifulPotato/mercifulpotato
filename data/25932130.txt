I would agree with you on this point in most cases but this is a very unique situation in which everyone will make money once the people on the short end capitulate.<p>I suppose it comes down to the question of whether people can stomach the ups and downs up until that capitulation. I think once you screen for all the spam and memes on WSB the explanations are very simple to understand. As someone who does not invest in individual stocks(I have done so maybe 3 times in my life, the rest is in index funds), I was able to understand the situation quite clearly.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to wager a large amount to make a large amount. The way it was explained makes sense that you could be up 10,000%, so invest $100 and you could end up with $10,000. This allows even small frys to put a little in and let the mechanics of the market do its job and at the worst case you lose money you wouldn&#x27;t have minded to lose anyways.<p>At this point, if anyone is thinking about getting in, i would proceed with caution. The stock has already blown up quite a bit so you probably wont be getting those big 10,000% paydays. I am not a financial analyst blah blah blah please dont sue me')
