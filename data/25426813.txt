The best I&#x27;ve found for sleeping on long flights are the Bose QC20 - the noise cancelling is as good as their over-the-ear headsets but the in-ear design makes them much more comfortable if you happen to rest your head on one side while sleeping, and doing so doesn&#x27;t interrupt the noise cancellation.<p>Since they&#x27;re cabled to an external battery box they can easily last through any flight, and you can leave the USB charge cable connected to an in-flight power socket while you use them to keep the battery full.')
