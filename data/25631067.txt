But in general, this is a dispute between A and B. C should let those two countries handle it. I.e., deport the citizen back to A, their home country. [edited: s&#x2F;extradite&#x2F;deport]<p>Consider: in many countries, certain forms of speech are illegal. I shouldn&#x27;t need to worry that I may have said something illegal in China in order to visit South Korea. It&#x27;s hard enough to learn all the laws in the country I am visiting, let alone every country that directly or indirectly has an extraction treaty.<p>The one scenario where I could see this being reasonable is within a bloc of countries that have free travel between and a somewhat unified set of laws, and only for breaking one of those bloc-level laws.')
