It will be quick and effective and we really don’t have any other tool. We still don’t have a prophylaxis or treatment. People are going to die that shouldn’t be dying and I’m not just talking about COVID patients. When hospitals are full, people die.<p>Ivermectin is not a supplement. It’s an expensive anti-scabies drug. I’ve read it’s supposedly somewhat effective but I haven’t seen anyone implement it in treatment yet at least in the US. I’m familiar with the IMASK+ protocol. I believe they are using that in Peru but it doesn’t appear to have been making any changes in the death rate.')
