There is an inherent cynicism in the setting that needs to shine through as a fundamental part of the genre&#x27;s identity.<p>Also, it&#x27;s only 57 years in the future. You&#x27;re not going to advance <i>that much</i> in that time. Personally I think the aesthetic seems a little too trapped in 80s retrofuturism -- I guess I agree with Gibson there -- but that was always the interpretation of cyberpunk and scifi that I liked the most so it gets a pass.<p>There is plenty of whimsical, optimistic visions into the future, and while I think a setting that explores &quot;high tech, low life&quot; in that context would be cool to see, it&#x27;d feel a lot closer to Star Wars than &quot;cyberpunk&quot;.')
