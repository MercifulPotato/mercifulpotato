Back in the early 90s, I played Dactyl Nightmare at some tourist location. All 4 members of my family were in the same &quot;world&quot; and could see each other. It was, like most VR games today, fun for about 10 minutes. There&#x27;s still some interesting experiences being developed at portable venues (ie, thevoid.com).<p>But I&#x27;d also say that FOV is really, really important. Right now the experience is just like putting a little TV on your face with an IMU. Immersion requires peripheral vision and spatial audio.')
