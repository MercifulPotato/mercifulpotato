Do not become a threat or a problem, keep your opinions to yourself, carefully observe the Personalities and structure and understand who they are and why they are acting this way.<p>Do not engage in gossip or any negativity. Do not complain or criticize or raise questions.<p>You do not know the pressures, history or forces causing the behavior of your management and if you become the problem you are cooked.<p>I experienced a toxic situation myself recently, it caused me to do a lot of reading and research.<p>My peers who remained positive and optimistic and polite and non threatening or competitive survived the environment fine. They made a mental decision to be positive.<p>If you find yourself in this persons situation you had better keep your mouth shut until you can find a new place to go or you will get killed off by your peers and your management.')
