Just as the Internet Archive and others are championing a distributed web [1], technologists must champion distributed development systems. Perhaps a reasonable target is to be able to perform a &quot;git pull&quot; from IPFS? As Gilmore said [2], interpret censorship as damage and route around it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=distributed+web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=distributed+web</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kirste.userpage.fu-berlin.de&#x2F;outerspace&#x2F;internet-article.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kirste.userpage.fu-berlin.de&#x2F;outerspace&#x2F;internet-arti...</a> (First Nation in Cyberspace, TIME International - Dec. 6, 1993, No.49)')
