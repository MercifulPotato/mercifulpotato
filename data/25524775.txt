True for any of us.<p>Fact is, we all get some time here.  It is not much.<p>The other hard fact is, barring some reasonable fraction of time possible for us, what we, you, any of us want has very little impact on what we get.<p>You don&#x27;t have to accept it.  Whether you do, or not, mostly matters to you, and you don&#x27;t have to tell either.<p>Maybe one day our understanding will allow us to transcend this state of affairs.  I sometimes think about all the lost souls.<p>Then I think about the ones who will be just this &gt;.&lt; close!<p>Gotta be rough for them, right?<p>So, here is how I play it:<p>While I am here, I can amplify the good, love, laugh, play, do, build and the way I see it, am lucky!<p>I am here, there is a lot to do, people I love, much to experience.<p>Was a free ticket to a great ride!<p>When it ends, I won&#x27;t be worried any more than I was before getting that ticket.<p>So far, nobody reports back.  When it is over, it&#x27;s over.<p>There are other travellers here.  Ticket holders.  Sure glad for that!  We don&#x27;t have to do it alone, and I found someone!  She is the best.  That helps a lot.<p>All told?<p>Very nice problems to have.  No complaints!<p>I do not think about it much past that.<p>Travel well.  Enjoy the ride.  That&#x27;s what a lot of us do.<p>...or not.<p>Works the same either way.')
