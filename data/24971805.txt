The fact that they&#x27;ve yet to respond indicates that either they or the lawyers they&#x27;ve spent the last week talking to are having difficulty finding a response to the RIAA&#x27;s notice. (This doesn&#x27;t mean that they won&#x27;t file a notice, just that the issue is not a piece of cake like so many people on HN believe.)')
