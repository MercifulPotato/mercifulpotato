In my experience it gives noisy results, so it&#x27;s most valuable when I have a lot of time to personally examine the output -- contrasted with tools like property testing which can be trivially integrated into an automated pipeline.<p>As one class of examples, a ton of numeric code works by iteratively finding better solutions till some stopping condition is met, and since such algorithms are by design robust to certain kinds of perturbations a mutation testing framework will find a ton of mutations which don&#x27;t meaningfully affect the final output. Interpreting such a report requires spending time to figure out if any particular perturbation should or should not have been detected by your tests.')
