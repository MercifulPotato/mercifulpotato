Using the firefighter example, it would be like all of a sudden, the whole city caught on fire. And then once the city is out, the next city catches on fire and because there aren&#x27;t enough firefighters there, you go to help. And then once that city is out, the next, etc.<p>Added on top of the fact they are worried they&#x27;ll catch the virus and maybe even spread it to their loved ones. In the US at least, I imagine most nurses thought they would work with less or non-infectious diseases, like cardiovascular diseases, not an outbreak that could lead them to infecting and killing people they loved.<p>Again, I think there are just some variables that make this situation different than what they thought they were signing up for.')
