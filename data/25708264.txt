In the 70s offshoring occured in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and others SE Asia countries but they didn&#x27;t have enough cheap labors to continue.  American companies would have been timid to shift operations to Indonesia and India when they lacked severe infrastructure, with no totalitarian government to enforce cheap labor.<p>- As a corollary, GE&#x2F;Intel would not not have shed all its capabilities to Asia, and be greatly diminished today.<p>- Wall street might not have been able to push companies to greatly shed cost and ship capabilities overseas due to national security issues.  As a result, US unions would have been intact somewhat and the jobs would not have been shipped to China.  Flyover states would have enjoyed greater strength as they did in the 60s and 70s.<p>- the great crash of 2008 would not have happened (Chinese entry into WTO greatly reduced manual jobs in US and Europe, crashing both economies)<p>- Trump would not have been elected.  Trump was a reaction to much jobs lost and much sufferings in flyover states caused by China.<p>- Coronavirus spread around the world and all the deaths that occurred may not have happened (China would have been still a closed off country, not unlike what Xi Jing Ping is trying to do today).  No mass flights out of Wuhan or Beijing.')
