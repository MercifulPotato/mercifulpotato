I&#x27;d be super interested to hear more!<p>I&#x27;m one of those annoying people with a donate button. Despite my project&#x27;s size (~10.5k stars on Github), it pulls down only about $60&#x2F;month. While awesome, and I&#x27;m legit thankful for the people who back open source, it&#x27;s obviously not yet at an amount where I could devote my time to open source entirely or even part time (which would be the dream!).<p>My recent minor release took about 45 hours to prepare, then another 8 for a quick followup tacking on some additional functionality. Which is to say, open source gets me about $1&#x2F;hr ^_^')
