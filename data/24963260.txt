The folks I find that don&#x27;t have those skills aren&#x27;t stupid or talentless, but rather victims of a series of roles and managers that have instilled a kind of Stockholm Syndrome of &quot;when these things fail, there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it, just consider it spooky and move on with your life&quot;, when getting at what&#x27;s really going on is not just easy to do, but super beneficial for your career development!<p>Put another way, we&#x27;re all systems programmers in our day jobs--some of us are just in denial.<p>&#x2F;rant<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvns.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;debug-your-programs-like-theyre-closed-source&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvns.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;debug-your-programs-like-the...</a>')
