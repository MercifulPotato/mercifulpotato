If we were still in an office environment, I would have made them leave their work laptop in the office just so they don&#x27;t try to sign on.<p>Some of the reasoning I&#x27;ve heard from these employees is that they believe they&#x27;re the only one who can solve an issue. They&#x27;re the ones who jump on it when it comes up during the regular day so if it re-appears they feel the need to jump on the grenade - explaining to them that other people can (and will) fix the problem helps, though it usually takes a few go arounds to get the point.<p>There are times I&#x27;m on call, and I&#x27;ll be pretty pro-active. Even if I don&#x27;t get paged but major events are going on, I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on them. On the other hand when I&#x27;m off call? Unless someone picks up a phone and calls me, it&#x27;s not even on my mind.')
