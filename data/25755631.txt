It&#x27;s only secure as long as you&#x27;re not aware of exploits - and given how complex these systems are (not counting the software they&#x27;re deployed on) you&#x27;ll never even have a 95% guarantee.  The real ringer is that as long as someone has an IOS or Android exploit that lets you listen to they keyboard or IO inputs, the security of what you&#x27;re typing into doesn&#x27;t matter one bit ;)')
