Your health care costs the same regardless of your work hours, and it&#x27;s a significant fraction of compensation. If you were working 80% as much, they would probably only be able to pay 70% of your salary.<p>(Assuming you were linearly productive, which it&#x27;s not, but it&#x27;s the same assumption you were making and is good enough for this illustration.)<p>There are other fixed overheads, like your manager, human resources, the office itself, and even the cost of hiring you in the first place. It&#x27;s possible that to make all things equal, they might have to change your salary to as much at 60%.<p>Of course all things are never equal, so these numbers have really wide error bars. And after all that, you might well decide that 60% salary for a 32 hour week would still be a good deal. I know I&#x27;d consider it. But it&#x27;s important to note that it&#x27;s going to be rare to find a job that will pay you 80% as much for 80% of the work.')
