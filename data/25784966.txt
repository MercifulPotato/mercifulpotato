The Aria scale just randomly can&#x27;t upload weights, also it will randomly just turn on for a whole day thinking you are trying to weigh yourself and will stay in that mode until it kills the batteries.   I&#x27;ve had multiple of their bands and they all lasted less than a year before they had something break.  At my work we gave every employee a Fitbit charge hr, and within 6 months half of them had the band separate from the sensor.  I had another Charge HR that one day turned off and then never turned back on after 3 months of use.<p>I wanted to like them, but the quality of the product was lacking, and I&#x27;m happier with the Apple Watch.')
