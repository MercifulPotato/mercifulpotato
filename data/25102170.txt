Embedded access points are crappy, and loading OpenWRT on them just makes them crappy in different ways. I&#x27;m sure enterprise gear is better than the consumer stuff on average, but it&#x27;s still painting myself into a corner.<p>In a similar vein, it pains me to hear people complain about SD issues with Raspberry Pis. My Kodi terminal will die occasionally due to SD card issues, and the only local disk usage it does is booting and the occasional dist-upgrade. The things are meant to be cheap and accessible, not reliable. If you&#x27;re setting up a server in which you will be investing your time, an RPi is the wrong tool for the job.')
