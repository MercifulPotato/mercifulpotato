Waiting until the practice is both widespread and normalized is a losing strategy. The use of cell phone data is well understood, well litigated, and for all intents and purposes, settled law. To come along and unwind all that now is sisyphaean. We need to start getting out <i>in front</i> of the issues. Not reacting all the time. And certainly not allowing privacy violations that affect others, then trying to prevent the very same privacy violation from affecting our own.<p>The people doing the violating are going to double down. They don&#x27;t want their critics being proved right. They don&#x27;t want to be accused of being hypocritical. So what are they going to do?<p>As privacy activists, we need to make it easy for potential partners to cooperate with us. Right now, we&#x27;re making it very difficult for potential partners to cooperate with us.
