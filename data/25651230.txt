It’s really not important at all for anyone I have spoken to. Most of our stacks are magical fucking unicorns to the marketing and decision makers and the majority of the developers these days. The level of response I get is akin to “but it’s got electrolytes” while blindly downloading god knows what into production kubernetes clusters. Hell even kubernetes does it. I’m waiting for something to waltz in and do some damage. Even worse is some of the scanning software which itself ships with CVE ridden dependencies. I mentioned this to one of the larger supply chain scanning vendors and they didn’t even know.<p>99% of our tech is like smoking to look cool and being in with the crowd.
