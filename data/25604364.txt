The mobile phone wasn&#x27;t. Computers in their post-WW2 form basically weren&#x27;t, for the last half decade if not more it&#x27;s all been private sector. Yes, DARPA did some very early work on packet switching networks and their work became widely adopted mostly because it was free: nice. But the moment these inventions started to matter, all R&amp;D was taken over by the private sector.<p>Governments spray so much money at things that I&#x27;m sure for almost any broad category of thing, you can find <i>something</i> they funded. But that&#x27;s no evidence that stuff would never have been researched anyway, given the enormous and long term R&amp;D efforts routinely mounted by non governmental entities. Look at AI: government funded institutions are constantly lagging behind.<p><i>It sucks a bit that it&#x27;s this way but if you are profit driven, you can&#x27;t gamble 140 billion of your own money in hopes of developing new tech.</i><p>Alphabet alone spends something like $21 billion on R&amp;D per year. It doesn&#x27;t take many years of that to reach $140 billion, and Alphabet is not the only company doing basic research.<p>Having spent many years reading research papers coming out of both academia and industry, my conclusion has been that the best papers are always those with corporate funding - some academic teams receive partly corporate funding and these tend to be in the middle, pure corporate labs tend to do the most exciting work. The bureaucrat-distributed money often gets allocated for decades to intellectual dead ends nobody cares about, purely through inertia and lack of institutional incentives to maximise ROI.')
