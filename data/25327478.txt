We in the &quot;civilized&quot; world _should_ know this better than anybody. We are shielded from so much death on a daily basis and yet have to deal not at all with the death we shower on others outside our borders.<p>We, the taxpayers from these countries, have been ruthlessly drone-bombing innocents, arming horribly violent terrorists in foreign conflicts, and running shadow campaigns against elected leaders for a century.<p>With extremely few exceptions, just about everybody from a North American or EU country is from a place complicit in these atrocities.<p>There is nothing new about the amount of death we are reported to be dealing with thanks to COVID-19. In fact, it&#x27;s a walk in the park compared with the last 20 years of American &amp; European foreign policy.<p>Maybe you and your relatives are all just a bit new to the whole &quot;death&quot; thing, but many of us have been aware of it for some time and it just doesn&#x27;t hold quite the same weight.<p>Once you see a country&#x27;s ruler getting sodomized by a bayonet until they die, a flu-like illness doesn&#x27;t really read quite the same as you seem to perceive it.')
