One man&#x27;s waste is another&#x27;s treasure.<p>&quot;Unlike other economic activities, the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste.&quot;<p>Does playing video games &quot;produce absolutely nothing?&quot; Some would say so, others would say not, that it produces positive emotions in players. But the entire ecosystem of gaming no doubt &quot;wastes&quot; more energy than bitcoin mining. Who gets to decide, to decree, what constitutes &quot;waste?&quot; That it&#x27;s ok to engage in certain activities, like gaming, which some people would classify as &quot;waste,&quot; but not ok to engage in others.<p>And the climate change argument as the cherry on top. Time to power down everything then. No more bitcoin mining, no more cars, no more travel, watching movies, it&#x27;s all &quot;wasteful.&quot; Shut it all down.')
