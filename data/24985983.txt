These were not great experiences and led to frustration on both sides.<p>I&#x27;ve also been on teams where we work very closely with UX and they are a part of all our agile ceremonies, etc.  They were a core team member of the team.<p>The latter experience was on a mobile team. We would review the proposed designs as a team, make comments on potential navigation issues, or non-standard UI elements for our platform.  There was some give or take here on both sides. \nOnce we were in general agreement the dev teams would start their implementation work.<p>Then we had a bi-weekly meeting for both platforms where a rotating engineer would meet with the team&#x27;s UX team member (UX-Palooza) for 30 minutes. They would come prepared with a list of small UI issues they saw that they wanted adjusted.  Minor alignment issues, font issues, etc.  Things that were too small to bother writing up tickets for.  The developers would try to fix everything live while sitting with the UX team member and if anything seemed like it would take more than a couple minutes we would create a story.<p>I feel like this model worked <i>really</i> well. The one &quot;drawback&quot; is that the UX team member identified more with the product development team than their UX peers who didn&#x27;t operate like this. I feel like it may have caused some friction between the UX team member and their broader UX organization.')
