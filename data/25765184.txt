I&#x27;m not sure if anyone fell for it in the US then and it&#x27;s really a more 1940s type corruption.<p>I&#x27;m probably saying the obvious but fun fact: These communist and fascist countries called themselves socialist and advertised themselves as such because it was socialists that fought against them the most.
