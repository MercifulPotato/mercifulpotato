I&#x27;ve been looking for the kinds of communities&#x2F;fields that recognise the properties you&#x27;ve described and study&#x2F;discuss them more in-depth, as it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve noticed a few years ago and am deeply interested in. It seems the peak of investigation into system properties was in the 50s, and despite the idea (or at least the meme) of cybernetics being embedded into everything futuristic&#x2F;high-tech, I haven&#x27;t found much actual interest&#x2F;community around these ideas outside of maybe academia (which I&#x27;m not involved in, or sure how I would even access).')
