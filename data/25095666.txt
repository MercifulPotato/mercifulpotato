You haven&#x27;t heard of these firms and they aren&#x27;t interested in your money.<p>Market makers usually do quite well for themselves, but are capacity constrained: they can earn stellar returns on tens of millions of capital, but maybe not hundreds of millions or billions. You probably haven&#x27;t heard of most of these firms and they would prefer to keep it that way.<p>of course if you want a public example, look at RenTec. They are unique in generating eye popping returns with such a large amount of capital. This is extremely uncommon. However generating comparable returns on 500-1000x less capital is significantly more common. These returns often don&#x27;t compound tho, as they are severely capacity constrained.')
