Even with margins of error in the millions of years and light years, it just seems that most of it is assumptions supported not by evidence (because we can&#x27;t get direct evidence) but by previous assumtions which have over time fossilised into accepted theories.<p>Not saying this paper isn&#x27;t good or anything, just that extrapolating a supernova from a few atoms of an isotope of a metal seems... a long fetch.
