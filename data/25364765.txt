I&#x27;d rather have some clarity and honesty than a stack of sneaky fee and not knowing who gets paid what.\nI have been pretty much only doing pick up orders (from the restaurant&#x27;s site) since the whole tip stealing debacle. I know that some people would like jobs in the delivery space for flexibility and extra income but it seems too dishonest of a space for me to caution. Just my feeling tho, plenty of no-car downtown life friends who order and that&#x27;s their choice :).')
