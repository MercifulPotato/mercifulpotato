So establishments already ostensibly having all the required authorizations according to existing regulation.

Saying &quot;we&#x27;re just a tech company&quot; is like ThePirateBay, YouTube, or The Silk Road saying &quot;we just store and transfer blobs of unidentified data between completely anonymous users&quot;. You are responsible for what happens on your platform especially if you are encouraging people to break the law by giving them tools <i>explicitly</i> for this and paying them.
