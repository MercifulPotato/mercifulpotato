Don&#x27;t assume that your personal experience is the norm across the entire industry. The Google C++ style guide is (unfortunately) popular, but it still covers the minority of C++ projects overall, and there&#x27;s plenty of criticism of it around, including from large teams working on production systems.<p>I will also add that, from my past experience working on codebases that didn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t use exceptions (e.g. across C ABI boundary), the <i>lack</i> of exceptions, and people forgetting to check error codes, or propagating them improperly, was a very common source of hidden bugs.')
