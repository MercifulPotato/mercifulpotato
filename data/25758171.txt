If you accept that this one company should be allowed to decide to cut off someone for ideological reasons, you tacitly accept that all companies could cut someone off for the same reason.<p>I&#x27;m not <i>people</i>.  I&#x27;m just me and don&#x27;t represent anyone else except myself.<p>As for it being &quot;just one company,&quot; that isn&#x27;t really important.  It could be 10 or 100 or 1000 companies and I&#x27;d say the same thing.<p>And not because of the content of the political views being (or not) supported.<p>It has nothing to do with any of that.<p>If the government can force Stripe (or anyone else) to support a particular (it doesn&#x27;t matter which one either) viewpoint by forcing them to associate with a person or group they don&#x27;t wish to associate with, then they can force me (or you, for that matter) to do the same.<p>I can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t speak for <i>anyone</i> else.  For <i>me</i>, it&#x27;s about specific constitutional rights.  I don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t support abridgement of those rights for <i>anyone</i>, whether I agree with them or not.<p>If you believe that it&#x27;s just fine for persons or organizations to have their freedom of association rights abridged, then you are anti-freedom and stand in opposition to the liberties and ideals in my constitution.<p>And if that&#x27;s true, then so be it.  But don&#x27;t try to pretend that your argument is anything other than an anti-liberty, anti-democratic (small d) one.')
