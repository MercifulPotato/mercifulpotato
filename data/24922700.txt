The price is $250,000, plus a monthly payment of five percent of the gross of all four hotels. [sneers] Mr. Corl-ee-own-eh.<p>Michael Corleone:\nNow, the price of a gaming license is less than $20,000. Is that right?<p>Senator Pat Geary:\nThat&#x27;s right.<p>Michael Corleone:\nSo why would I ever consider paying more than that?<p>Senator Pat Geary:\nBecause I intend to squeeze you. I don&#x27;t like your kind of people. I don&#x27;t like to see you come out to this clean country with your oily hair, dressed up in those silk suits, passing yourselves off as decent Americans. I&#x27;ll do business with you, but the fact is that I despise your masquerade, the dishonest way you pose yourself. Yourself and your whole f<i></i>*ing family.<p>Michael:\nSenator. We&#x27;re both part of the same hypocrisy...but never think it applies to my family.<p>Senator Pat Geary:\n[exasperated] Okay. Some people need play little games. You play yours. Let&#x27;s just say that you&#x27;ll pay me because it&#x27;s in your interest to pay me. But I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don&#x27;t you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.<p>Michael:\nSenator? You can have my answer now, if you like. My offer is this: nothing. Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would appreciate if you would put up personally.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sG2-FI5_INA?t=96" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sG2-FI5_INA?t=96</a>')
