The Russian defense industrial complex also cranks out a lot of small arms.  They want to be able to sell stuff into the US market.  The NRA wants the US market to be able to buy small arms from across the world.  Considering how blurry the line between politics, special interest lobbying, the arms industry and the government itself is in Russia I think it comes as no surprise that people with pay stubs on government letterhead are trying to get buddy-buddy with the NRA.<p>It&#x27;s kind of irrelevant though since there&#x27;s rules for that sort of stuff (registering as a foreign agent) and Russia shouldn&#x27;t expect any slack in lights of their geopolitical ventures on their western border.')
