Any specific niche has a competitor, but none of them seriously competes with the whole of YouTube.<p>I noticed the outage because I wanted to watch a stream, so I might go to Twitch now. Often I use Youtube for music, where Spotify is a solid alternative with many of the same creators. If I want to see that video from reddit of people throwing burning flares at a balcony I can probably find it on LiveLeak. Many of the educational channels I&#x27;ve subscribed are also on Nebula, but I could also watch a documentary on Netflix or Disney+ instead.')
