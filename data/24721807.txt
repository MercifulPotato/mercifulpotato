Agreed that Doppler and EnvKey have different threat models. Regarding your point about malicious JavaScript- I&#x27;d encourage you to take a look at our Content Security Policy. We&#x27;ve gone to great lengths to explicitly disallow all unsafe-inline JavaScript (technically in report mode, but will be moved to block mode within the next few days). This is just one of many things we do to help keep our users secure, but I figured it was worth addressing directly. We&#x27;ve also undergone extensive internal and external audits and pentests to ensure we&#x27;re not susceptible to XSS and CSRF (and employ development practices to prevent us from introducing these vulns).<p>I&#x27;d also argue that EnvKey might be a bit too absolutist about security, in that we think the user experience greatly suffers as a result. We have a different tradeoff that emphasizes secure defaults and best practices while also allowing for necessary features like audit logs and syncing with different infra providers. We spent quite a bit of time considering the tradeoffs of zero-trust, but our user experience would suffer as a result, and so we have taken a different approach.')
