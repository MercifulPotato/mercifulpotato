This will be tightly integrated with Re-frame&#x2F; Reagent&#x2F; React and be quite specific to OrgPad (so there isn&#x27;t much reason to open source it or anything like that). I think, it might be one of the few editors written in ClojureScript though.\nThe issues are multiple. E.g. flickering, when the browser tries to do spell check. The API for spell check is not very useful from what I understood between the swear words by Pavel :-D e.g. it just isn&#x27;t possible to give it words and receive suggestions back and handle the rest in the application. More and more of the web infrastructure begins to show its root in the static web of the 90s and is hardly helpful for a modern application, where flickering just isn&#x27;t an option. It seems, we will have our own spell check in the future or whatever to prevent the flickering. There is more stuff like this in the broader web technology stack.<p>The prototype is I think about 3000 lines of ClojureScript code. It does quite a bit already but there is more to be done. When it is somewhat done, Pavel will probably record a talk about it and put it on our YouTube channel.')
