After that: I&#x27;m not going back.<p>Everything is faster, everything looks sane. The few sites where custom fonts are an integral part of the value? I&#x27;m willing to re-activate fonts for those. Happens almost never.<p>Only &quot;problem&quot; is that icon fonts are blocked (hamburger menus, thumbs up buttons), but I can live with that (and if it&#x27;s too difficult to use, I may also re-activate fonts temporarily).')
