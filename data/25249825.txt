I printed out an ad, taped it on my door and waited for the knocks to do business. Back in those days, I would burn chips with hard-to-find .bin files using generic EEPROM programmers that used a printer parallel port. And I never had to buy any chips because, at the time, I&#x27;d request samples from the big silicon distributors (e.g. DigiKey &#x2F; Mouser) and they&#x27;d send me dozens for free.')
