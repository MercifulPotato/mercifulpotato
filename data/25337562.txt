Item(by='uh_uh', descendants=None, kids=[25339445], score=None, time=1607375371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25335858, text='Even if she didn&#x27;t resign (which is questionable, because she did send an ultimatum), is it wrong for Google to fire a person who writes stuff like this?<p>&gt; I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.<p>This excerpt is from the email that according to her triggered the firing. This person threatened her employer with a lawsuit in the past and now people are outraged that she got &quot;abrubtly fired&quot;. Arguably, the way Google treated her was even too lenient: many companies would have fired her at the time her original threat was made.')
