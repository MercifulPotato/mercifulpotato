I&#x27;ve got 20 YoE, an elite college degree, tons of experience in Python and C++, have single-handedly put together mission critical software systems, and I can&#x27;t get my foot in the door outside my small area of expertise. The teams I&#x27;ve worked on are tiny, so I have no career network to draw from. I&#x27;m missing machine learning and cloud experience, and my resume gets no hits because of it. Age 44, and I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;ve been aged out. As far as I can tell, no one is interested in experience that consists of project successes. It&#x27;s just years of buzzwords and coding challenges. (So I just signed up for Hackerrank. Maybe someone will notice me there.)')
