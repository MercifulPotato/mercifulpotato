Everybody (newspapers, social media) can be held liable for their OWN content (e.g. the NYT for their articles).\n2. Nobody can be held liable for disseminating OTHER people&#x27;s content (letters to the editor, tweets), whether or not they decide to filter some of that content out of their own volition.\n3. (This is where my understanding gets murky) Once the disseminating entity has been made aware that something they disseminate is illegal (copyright violation, illegal pornography, etc), they bear some responsibility for stopping the further dissemination.')
