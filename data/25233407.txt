Is there a way for me to delete the submission?<p>I posted it on HN as I liked the points in the article. The points in the post are reasonable provided there&#x27;s fair equity for the employees (which I believe is disclosed prior to joining - I have no knowledge about dilution, preference etc). I also agree with the commenters on HN that it doesn&#x27;t make much sense when there&#x27;s no equity.<p>But there are too many comments making the same&#x2F;similar point.<p>I personally find what Alex is doing is inspiring, running a 200 person company (ref: article) at 23 is remarkable. I also applaud his courage to publicly share what he thought was best advice.<p>I might get downvoted for this but I couldn&#x27;t not say this.')
