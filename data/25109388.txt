Item(by='amake', descendants=None, kids=[25111051], score=None, time=1605515129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109083, text='The choice of `ch` is clearly inspired by English, but the other common alternatives (Nihonshiki, Kunreishiki) are not self-consistent in that they paper over differences in pronunciation. To be consistent you need to represent „Å° as something other than `ti`, so then why not `chi`?<p>At this point anything other than Hepburn and Nihonshiki&#x2F;Kunreishiki is a non-starter due to lack of familiarity, so I would be happy if everyone would just get on board with Hepburn.')
