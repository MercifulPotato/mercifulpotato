The owner of the repair shop that allegedly received the laptop from Biden is a super far right conspiracy theorist.  To the point where he literally believes that the Clintons are out to kill him for the information he has [1].<p>The whole story is that this is Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop, but in reality some random dude dropped it off and the owner said that &quot;he had a medical condition that prevented him from actually seeing who dropped off the laptop but that he believed it to be Hunter Bidenâ€™s because of a sticker related to the Beau Biden Foundation that was on it.&quot; [1].<p>Then, it gets passed off to Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani back at the start of the year when Guiliani is already trying to get Ukraine to stir up a story on Hunter Biden.  They then sit on it for most of the year and release it 20 days before the election.<p>Something like this, even as absurd as it is, will take weeks to thoroughly debunk.  Meanwhile, people are literally in lines voting and stuff like this has an effect.  That&#x27;s probably why it was released right now, because even though it&#x27;s most likely false, by the time it has flown around the internet unimpeded the damage will have already been done.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;man-who-reportedly-gave-hunter...</a>')
