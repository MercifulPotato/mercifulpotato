The most likely proposed method was that the GBoard (google soft-keyboard) was &quot;updated&quot; with a poison update that uploaded everything typed. What defenses does Signal have against that? And will Signal warn against unverified GBoard updates that haven&#x27;t been vetted?<p>If you can&#x27;t trust your OS then you&#x27;ve lost already. This complaint is also fun considering the number of people who yell about banks doing things like refusing to run if nonstandard keyboards are installed.<p>&gt; Signal still demands your phone# to make an account. This by itself is unconscionable for an application that purports to be for security and privacy.<p>The alternative appears to be &quot;Signal knows which users you have communicated with&quot;, which is much worse. All sorts of interesting things can be obtained from the communication graph.')
