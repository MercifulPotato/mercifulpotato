Capitalism is the system that enables the kind of people you call twisted and unethical to do their twisted and unethical things and &quot;amass hugely disproportional wealth&quot;. And also the system that everyone else accepts because they hope that, one day, <i>they</i>&#x27;ll have the &quot;hugely disproportional wealth&quot; and be able to do twisted unethical things, themselves. Or, am I wrong? Did Adam Smith say that capital should be equally distributed, or something similar?')
