Because I’ve been paying attention and I’m genuinely unsure what is happening ... default skeptical about all claims in every direction.<p>No inside knowledge necessary.  Just read the court decisions themselves.  <i>They are public documents.</i><p>I don&#x27;t have the time or the inclination to dig up all 50+ court rulings, many of which explain in great detail, the deficiencies of the claims that have been made and&#x2F;or are unsupported by evidence.<p>If you are unaware of these court rulings (along with the claims being made by both sides, the arguments for and against and the opinions of the judges), that&#x27;s because <i>you</i> haven&#x27;t looked.  <i>Each and every case is in the public record</i>.<p>Don&#x27;t believe anyone who tells you there was&#x2F;wasn&#x27;t widespread electoral fraud&#x2F;irregularities.  Look at the documents yourself.  <i>They are publicly available</i> (yes, I know I&#x27;m repeating myself).<p>Hell, even a bunch of the ballot counting processes across the country were <i>live-streamed</i>.')
