Most of the time the particular error distribution doesn&#x27;t matter, and significant figures are a good enough approximation. The biggest issue most people have with them is that they&#x27;re first taught in high-school chemistry class, and they&#x27;re not taught error analysis first. Significant figures are then seen as difficult complications compared to just copying down what your calculator outputs, instead of a simplified approximation compared to the work needed to do a full error analysis. Sig figs thus get seen as something difficult and harder than the default, rather than as an easier shortcut than the default.<p>Also most calculators and unit converters don&#x27;t take them into account by default (or at all) since someone might actually have accurate tolerance information to do a full analysis.')
