Using force to end discussion is not free expression.<p>Absolutely.  However, not all speech is protected speech.  At least not in the US.<p>Speech can also be part of a conspiracy.  And conspiracy to commit criminal acts is a felony.<p>Which is, as I understand it, what the issue is in this case.  Apparently (if you take Amazon&#x27;s word for it, and once the dump from Parler is available, we can see for ourselves if that&#x27;s true), folks on Parler were planning acts of violence and insurrection on Parler.<p>Again, that&#x27;s my understanding.  And if that is the case, it&#x27;s not just folks exercising free speech.  It&#x27;s folks planning violence and insurrection against the US government.  Those are absolutely crimes and not protected speech in the US.<p>N.B.: IANAL')
