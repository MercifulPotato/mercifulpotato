There are lots of issues with the &#x27;Unemployment&#x27; metric. It is indeed a deceptive metric. However, it is deliberately misleading to append &#x27;True&#x27; to &#x27;Unemployment Rate&#x27; with a custom definition intended to make an argument. You are stacking confusion on confusion instead of clarifying. If you want to create a different metric around a &#x27;living wage,&#x27; then it should be defined in a way that makes that more clear.<p>There are also serious regional differences in what such a wage might be. $2000&#x2F;month is enough to live comfortably with a personal car in low cost of living regions. In NYC it means you are probably stacked into a decaying apartment with many other people with no car.')
