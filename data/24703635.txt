And not very feasible for countries with native&#x2F;endemic mammals that may scavenge a hog corpse.<p>But, poison works, albeit accidentally. We use a variety of other techniques to control introduced mammals - intensive trapping and poisoning in ecologically sensitive areas, judas goats[1], helicopter culling, and sometimes, just letting the free market handle it[2] - wild animal recovery is very good at keeping red deer populations at low - medium numbers... ...when the price of wild venison in Germany makes it economical. Although it has changed their behaviour - they become more daylight-averse, and quickly learn to hide from helicopters.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teara.govt.nz&#x2F;en&#x2F;photograph&#x2F;10136&#x2F;judas-goat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teara.govt.nz&#x2F;en&#x2F;photograph&#x2F;10136&#x2F;judas-goat</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doc.govt.nz&#x2F;get-involved&#x2F;apply-for-permits&#x2F;business-or-activity&#x2F;national-wild-animal-recovery-operations&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doc.govt.nz&#x2F;get-involved&#x2F;apply-for-permits&#x2F;busin...</a>')
