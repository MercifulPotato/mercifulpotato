As an alternative, limiting IFrame to 1-3 layers would do a <i>LOT</i> in terms of reducing the overhead&#x2F;bloat&#x2F;risk... you get a full ad network payload, that injects an iframe because of a buy miss, then another, another, etc and so on.<p>In the end, limiting IFrame depth would probably do more than many things for stopping some of the bad actors.<p>I use uBlock Origin and EFF Privacy Badger for most surfing, which does a decent enough job.  I don&#x27;t think that the enhancements to the protocol really do that much... though I also don&#x27;t know that some of the tradeoffs are worth losing a human-readable protocol.')
