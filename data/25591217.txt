Before we escaped JIRA, my team would often do that, too, even for regular sprints. Make a checklist in a collaborative editor tool like Google Docs or Notion, and just do the day to day work there.<p>Then somebody would have to copy it to JIRA so the work would get tracked.<p>But very little of the planning, work breakdown, day to day updates, or discussion actually happened on JIRA because it was literally like a hundred times slower (with the convoluted UI compounded by incessant &quot;wait... is it even loading?... oh, OK, it finally loaded&quot; at each step of the way).')
