Move the onions to the side, add another tbsp of butter, and toast a cup of steel-cut oats in it until it smells toasty&#x2F;nutty. Pour the liquid that came out of the chicken into the pot (saving the meat for later) and then add a carton (32 fl. oz.) of good chicken stock (which they&#x27;re calling bone broth these days at the supermarket).<p>Cook this for a while on medium heat (uncovered) until the oats are done (roughly 45 mins). Meanwhile, shred up the chicken really well with a pair of forks. When the oatmeal is done, stir in the shredded chicken. Season to taste.<p>Makes about four big servings, keeps great in the fridge for several days and reheats well. Makes a nutritious hot breakfast, especially with a sunny-side up egg on top. A traditional condiment for haleem is diced confit onions, which is also great. (I also like to add a bag of sauteed &quot;power greens&quot;)')
