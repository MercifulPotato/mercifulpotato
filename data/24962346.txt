Facebook is known for having one of the best data science departments in the world and when they want to change or add a feature of the website they do it for a small subset of users and see what the response is like. If the users seem to like it they can repeat the experiment with a larger subset of users. If the users don&#x27;t like the change there&#x27;s no big risk because only a few users were exposed.<p>Contrast this to how Snapchat completely changed their UI for nearly every user all at once and got a ton of negative feedback for it. That was a complete UI overhaul which is different than FB and their hundreds of mini-changes but the idea is similar.')
