There are plenty of things that can go wrong.<p>I had my own run in with chrome recently where dwm.exe (Desktop Windows Manager on win10) would eat and eat memory until everything OOM&#x27;ed. Didn&#x27;t use much CPU tho. I eventually tracked it down to a single chrome tab that had a specific website open. It&#x27;s reproducible at least on my system but I haven&#x27;t yet had the time to look into it more thoroughly. If I had to guess, it was the website making Chrome use some &quot;hardware layers&#x2F;surfaces&quot; or something like that and cause the corresponding buffers in dwm to be retained forever. No idea if it&#x27;s a chrome bug or a dwm bug or even some kind of driver bug, and just closing the tab was enough as a &quot;quick fix&quot;.')
