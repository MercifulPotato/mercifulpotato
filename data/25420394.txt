Speaking of adventure game puzzle analysis:  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewebsiteisdown.com&#x2F;twidblog&#x2F;day-of-the-tentacle-dependency-graph&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewebsiteisdown.com&#x2F;twidblog&#x2F;day-of-the-tentacle-dep...</a>.<p>I feel like there might be some tie in where instead of making a formal proof built into the game engine there could be a way to use a dependency graph as the thing which gets proved. Although the state of all the dependencies and transitions of those states based on all game moves would have to be represented. Food for thought. Thanks')
