However, in the event of an actual nuclear blast, some simple preparation would save lives. When a bright flash lights up the sky, people indoors will naturally run to the nearest window to see what happened. This is the wrong thing to do, because the bright flash of an explosion is followed a few seconds later by a pressure wave, turning the window glass into a fast-moving cloud of shrapnel.<p>Just getting under a desk or table away from any windows improves your chances of survival.
