Something to not only manage these goals &#x2F; activities as you&#x27;ve described, but also to contain various aspects of information for your life. A repository for important documents filed in a manner that makes sense, profiles for the various people in your life containing various information (things they like, allergies, gift ideas, etc). Lots more in my head that I will continue dreaming about but certainly not lift a finger about.')
