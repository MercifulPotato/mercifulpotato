Never claimed it was.<p>&quot;I think you&#x27;ll quickly find (etc)&quot; - I think you&#x27;re thinking about this the wrong way. Who, exactly, are you evaluating? The average adult who grew up in the school system, who learned that &#x27;learning&#x27; is all about being told stuff, and who now &#x27;knows enough&#x27; to hold down their job and pursue whatever hobbies they have in what little spare time they have? Not sure that&#x27;s representative of children, or how people grow up under a different system. And even there, you&#x27;d be surprised how often those adults still end up looking up information -that is of interest- to them.<p>I mean, heck, I&#x27;m one of those adults - outside of work what I learn is very little, because I don&#x27;t have the energy. And yet, I still am curious, I still ask questions, I still read things. Certainly, I look for opportunities to learn things as -part- of my work. I am the HN crowd, sure, but I&#x27;m also a consummate gamer and waster of time. Heck, I&#x27;ll even waste my time responding to HN comments. :P<p>Beyond that, for children, if you&#x27;re just looking at kids who are already in school...yeah. No kidding. After 5-8 hours in school being &#x27;taught&#x27; things, why they heck would someone spend their free time learning things outside of it? It&#x27;s just like a job. But what about a kid who has hours of free time, and who sees, constantly, that there are people around them who &#x27;know things&#x27;, and they don&#x27;t? They&#x27;ll ask questions. Lots of questions. Encourage that, and you have learning.<p>I mean, I can&#x27;t speak to you, the HN crowd at large, or people at large (nor can you), but I can say that given just the spare time the quarantine has given me, my unproductive pursuits very quickly ran dry (not for lack of them), and I&#x27;ve picked up learning a number of new things to fill the time. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s nearly as uncommon as you might think.')
