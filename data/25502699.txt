When complexity grows, you have to get used to various other patterns and concepts to write real-world applications.</i><p>Have you read the seminal paper &quot;Why Functional Programming Matters&quot;? In it, it&#x27;s argued -- quite successfully -- that FP is all about modularization and managing complexity. That is, that FP (and related techniques) is the way to go precisely in order to both modularize and glue the parts together, i.e. keep the complexity tractable.')
