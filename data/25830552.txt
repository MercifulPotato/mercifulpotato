Is it easier on a centralized platform or across thousands of federated instances, each with their own moderator?<p>You can also think of it like a terrorist wanting to bomb people, would you have more success in a dense area or if everyone is spread out?<p>With more small sites, instead of a few large sites it spreads out communities and insulates them. With centralized networks, it create a &quot;mother vein&quot; where it&#x27;s easier to plug into a large stream of users with little effort. No doubt capitalist extremists want centralized services too because they can convert everyone to their ideology, consumerism.')
