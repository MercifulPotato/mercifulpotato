Because we have a different name for specific weapons.<p>Here we can sell semiautomatic rifles (we call them &quot;carabinas&quot;, I didn&#x27;t label them as rifles so my bad), for hunting (a specific class, for boars, deer, etc). The thing is every weapon that&#x27;s imported in Portugal gets and inspection and a classification if it&#x27;s a military weapon or not. An AR15 is considered a military grade weapon by our government standards.<p>So yes, you can buy some specific models of semiautomatic rifles (for hunting), but you can&#x27;t buy military grade semiautomatic rifles.<p>You can&#x27;t buy an AR15.')
