The agents will hear a n incoming ring similar to a phone call as they receive new texts or web chats...  the communication space is definitely growing and evolving, Iâ€™ve been hacking in it now for 12 years and enjoy the problem space but not sure if you are looking for more of a Apple like solution or Salesforce style solution...  we are more similar to a salesforce solution in that you can customize CTM to do pretty much anything with our Javascript powered workflows and webhooks')
