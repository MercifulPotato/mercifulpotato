I live fairly near a fairly small (and admittedly somewhat downscale) city. Even if I lived walking distance from the downtown there which I don&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t actually shop there. There are a couple bank branches, a travel agency!, a convenience store, a few mostly downscale restaurants, etc. There&#x27;s very little I would go there far. I&#x27;d drive to the local supermarket or Walmart.')
