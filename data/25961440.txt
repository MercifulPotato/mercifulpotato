They can and will mess with you. But if you think talking to them will _reduce the chances_ of them messing you, many legal experts would disagree.<p>Talking to them gives them additional avenues by with they might claim that you committed the crime, you&#x27;re guilty, and they get to `solved_crimes_this_month += 1`.<p>It&#x27;s all risk mitigation.<p>They might treat you illegally and immorally, for sure. They&#x27;re not _less_ likely to do this if you consent to &quot;a conversation&quot;, they&#x27;re _more_ likely to do this.<p>So, again, don&#x27;t talk to police without a lawyer present.<p>When you&#x27;re lawyer gets on scene, he&#x27;ll say &quot;don&#x27;t talk to them&quot;, so you&#x27;ll continue to _not talk to them._<p>Many folks on HN that live in the USA, are statistically likely to not have particularly bad interactions with the police, but that means we have a chance (or even obligation) to normalize self-protective behaviors that persons who are not quite as (white|male|upper class| privileged) as we are might suffer repercussions for exercising.<p>I.E. if it spreads that &quot;privileged people don&#x27;t talk to police&quot; then &quot;marginalized people not talking to police&quot; are less likely to suffer abuse from said police.')
