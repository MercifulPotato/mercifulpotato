It was a massive PITA, but it mostly worked.  We switched over to AWS DMS and it was easy. Honestly it didn&#x27;t take much effort.  It has worked flawlessly - literally zero errors - from the day we started it up, and best of all, it&#x27;s free.  All you pay for is the instance it&#x27;s using for you.  That sort of thing can save startups much needed money.  Yes, you&#x27;re tied to the ecosystem - and that&#x27;s what they want - but it&#x27;s worth it.  Once I talk to people and basically say the same thing you&#x27;re saying, they start to look at AWS a bit differently.')
