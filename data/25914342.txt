Item(by='cies', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1611657726, title="GitHub's annoying page load progress bar", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Github is a tool for developers. Developers know that their page load progress bar (the blue line on top of the page) is fake: it does not show actual load status, it is a spinner that gives dressed up as load progress bar.<p>Recently the pull request overview page does not always load for me and then the progress bar&#x27;s lie comes out: it did not load anything, but it did lie to me about it.<p>Github: please stop it. I&#x27;m a developer, I pay for your service and I do not appreciate being lied to. When your PR-page does not load show me an ugly &quot;timed out&quot; or &quot;50x&quot; page. Don&#x27;t try to hide it, it comes off as disrespect for your rather smart user base.')
