My &quot;never happened&quot; was to a sustained period (12, 15+ years) of returns where your contributions weren&#x27;t worth much more than they were when you put them in. That would destroy an entire generation&#x27;s retirement. Your point about losing 5-8 years in your goal was to retire in 2008 is well taken. Folks in that position, assuming they had massive market exposure (which like you said is a mistake and extremely risky), had to either take a standard-of-living cut in retirement, continue working, or draw down principle and risk running out of money early.')
