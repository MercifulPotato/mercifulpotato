Item(by='bisectable', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607243866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316184, text='Given the current public discourse climate in academia, where 99% of the researchers are politically left or extreme left, I recommend a grain of salt for any research that makes claims racial discrimination. The report you quote has at least a couple of strange holes. The paper itself is behind a paywall, thus beyond mere mortals reach.<p>&gt; For example, in about 10% audits in which a white and an African-American auditor were sent to apply for the same unit after 2005, the white auditor was recommended more units than the African-American auditor. These trends hold in both the large HUD (Housing and Urban Development)-sponsored housing audits, which others have examined with similar findings to us, and in smaller correspondence studies<p>They fail to mention how large is the gap. Is the white auditor recommended 102 vs the black auditor 97, or 150 vs 50, or 200 vs 3? Without such critical information it is hard to form an opinion, unless one already has a large bias in accepting discrimination narratives uncritically.<p>&gt; In the mortgage market the researchers found that racial gaps in loan denial have declined only slightly, and racial gaps in mortgage cost have not declined at all, suggesting persistent racial discrimination. Black and Hispanic borrowers are more likely to be rejected when they apply for a loan and are more likely to receive a high-cost mortgage.<p>They fail to mention the magic words &#x27;when controlled for income&#x27;. America has a huge income disparity problem, which is conveniently forgotten behind the ongoing race (and gender) hucksterism. Assuming we&#x27;d wave a magic wand and fix all disparities across visible populations tomorrow, it will still not fix the fact that huge income disparities exist between individuals. Google engineers and researchers get paid 5 times the median national income or more, and (senior) Google management in the 10x to 1000x range. The vast majority of the population is stuck in dead end precarious jobs, with little social mobility, one medical emergency from bankruptcy.')
