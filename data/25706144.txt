I’ve been searching for some other “anchor” activity to base peripheral activities around.<p>I’ve tried a bunch of things, but what seems sustainable so far is mostly doing physical activities. Between basketball, swimming, yoga, lifting, stretching, and skating, it’s a nice platter of (solo) things to do. This is the stuff I did all the time in my teens. I basically did none of it in my twenties. But after a decade, I’m getting back into it.<p>It helps that’s I’m currently based in Florida where gyms are open.<p>I view this time for me as a UBI pre-trial. What would I be doing in a world where I don’t have to work anymore? It’s a good question to ponder.')
