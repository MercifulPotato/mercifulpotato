I&#x27;m not apart of their team, so that&#x27;s the best I can offer.<p>&gt; Do you think that reducing the amount of syntax-errors via a powerful structured-editor would help reduce the syntax burden?<p>Truthfully, no. It would resolve syntax errors for sure, but I think there&#x27;s something inherit to actually interacting and fixing mistakes that can&#x27;t be replicated with technology. If you think about learning a second language, having an automatic translator will help you speak to other people, but you would not actually know the language. Not attempting to invoke Turing&#x27;s Chinese Room, but rather there is a educational need to make mistakes, identify them, and resolve them that helps.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AdYMJ923Lys?t=90" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AdYMJ923Lys?t=90</a>')
