Then the data is copied from the buffer cache out to the user-supplied buffer during the return from the system call.<p>Doesn&#x27;t linux do shared-read-only mapping of pages on read(2) and only copy if you modify? Though it can only do so on page-aligned buffers. Maybe results would be different if the buffers were aligned?<p>&gt; So I changed my test to invoke mmap with MAP_POPULATE and learned that the experiment completes about 36% faster.<p>If your result spuriously change by 36%, you don&#x27;t really have a robust statistic, and a model&#x2F;understaing of objects measured. AFAIU, mmap with MAP_POPULATE should be equivalent to a read of whole file in a single call, on an aligned buffer - significant performance differences here would be interesting.')
