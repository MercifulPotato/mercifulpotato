While those so called &quot;menial tasks&quot; are no doubt important, rather invaluable to functioning of society, we should not imply let alone pretend, that they provide enough. So in terms of sheer economic value, if we believe our current way of measuring labor, those &quot;menial tasks&quot; are in fact not valuable. Because if they were they could provide a decent life, let alone being able to provide roof over your head.<p>What I find bewildering is how so many Americans, even here, can justify the sheer waste of time, and psychological trauma, with &quot;If he graduated with minimal debt and was able to get a good paying job, I&#x27;m not seeing the societal waste&quot;.<p>Such justifications either feel like exuding gross privilege or worse a result of some mass Stockholm Syndrome.')
