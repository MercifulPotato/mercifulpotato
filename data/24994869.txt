In recent centuries they&#x27;ve been pretty put off by the idea that psychedelics (or any other authority than their own) could give people true religious revelation or authentic religious experience, but it is possible that they might change their minds if they see the psychedelics actually re-enliven people&#x27;s sense of the sacred and start bringing them back to the fold.<p>Is it beyond imagining that one day we&#x27;ll see religious ceremonies involving psychedelics in mainstream churches, synagogues, and mosques?')
