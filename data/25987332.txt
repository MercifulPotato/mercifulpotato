If I can upload some text document or private picture with a web-browser onto some web host, then that web browser can also send that picture anywhere else to spy on me. Unless I need to give it permission every time I wish to do something such as that, which would be very cumbersome.<p>Now you are moving goalposts. Initially, you were discussing restrictions on the file system.<p>I concur that the current desktop security model is probably unfixable. All the tools to improve on it are here though. Android kinda solved it by restricting every app to its own assets and files by default. If the app needs more, it has to ask for permissions.<p>The problem with user approval for every single action is decision fatigue. It is already happening on Android: every app is asking for a ton of permissions. And it turns out that many of them are not granular enough. For example, Signal needs the numbers from the address book to find contacts, but nothing else. If I want that feature, I still have to give Signal access to the entire address book.')
