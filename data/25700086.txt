The Haskell filter expression is much nicer as well. You could perhaps be terser by using ternary conditionals:<p><pre><code>  def quicksort ( xs ):\n   return [] if len(list) == 0 else quicksort([x for x in xs[1:] if x &lt;= xs[0]]) + xs[0] + quicksort([x for x in xs[1:] if x &gt; xs[0]])</code></pre>')
