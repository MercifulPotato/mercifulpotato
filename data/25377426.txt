I think this could only happen in a place where they don&#x27;t value human life and have a concept of &quot;face&quot; that is more important than people&#x27;s lives, and where they don&#x27;t give a flying f. about people in other countries. They also have CCP party members talking officially about how great it is that so many westerners died: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QI2_Qz_kdRY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QI2_Qz_kdRY</a><p>If CCP handled the Virus at the start of it quickly and not lied to the last minute, then the virus would have been contained.\nI think China&#x27;s CCP is very much responsible for a lot of dead people all over the world, but I understand that not everyone shares this opinion.\nI mean on the other hand the west didn&#x27;t take this seriously and the good thing is that the virus is not that deadly and we hopefully be ready for the next one.\nAs a foreigner I see: 9&#x2F;11 in USA -&gt; USA invades Afganistan. Wuhan Virus -&gt; USA doesn&#x27;t seem to care, even if more people died, some even don&#x27;t believe it exists(please fix your education system)\nI mean as a CCP member I would think: ok now lets make another virus with long incubation and more deadly and let it loose somewhere in the western country or in Taiwan and then we invite ourselves there as a peace protectors...<p>I think we have to make Chinese people care about their government and we can do it buy using Sanctions so that CCP will lose money and chinese people will stop spewing nationalistic bullshit start caring about economy and by extension how the government does things.')
