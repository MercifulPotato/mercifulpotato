Cool, you saved $3. But you spent $500 to save it!</i><p>I agree in general with the sentiment that people need to really value their time more than they do. It is a precious ever-depleting resource. That said, we mustn&#x27;t discount the fact that:<p>1. One may get better at saving and wouldn&#x27;t always have to spend 5 hours on Amazon when looking for better deals the next time around.<p>2. It is not just $3, but might also be that one is learning along way (reading reviews, getting better at identifying quality signals, etc).<p>3. Developing a habit because every buck one spends could have been saved for (future frugal expenses), because not every waking hour is worth $100 anyway.<p>4. Valuing all of one&#x27;s time in terms of billable-hours could be actually used to justify <i>not</i> doing anything else at all; and life&#x2F;learning&#x2F;experiences would simply flash-by.')
