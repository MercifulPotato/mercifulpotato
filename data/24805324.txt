People are more likely to just skip hearings.<p>D.C. uses a no-cash-bail system, and IIRC does not see this compared to either when they used cash bail or to other jurisdictions that do.<p>&gt; Or they keep committing minor crimes because they don&#x27;t view themselves as facing consequences.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s evidence that this is the case, but insofar as it is, it seems it would be a speedy trial problem. (And&#x2F;or a reason certain suspects ought not to be eligible for bail of any kind.)')
