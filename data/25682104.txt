Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25682203], score=None, time=1610087043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681641, text='Editorializing titles like this is against the site guidelines and will cause you to lose submission privileges on HN.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>In this case it&#x27;s tricky because the article&#x27;s own title is baity, so the HN guidelines call for changing it: &quot;<i>Please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait</i>&quot;. But they add &quot;<i>don&#x27;t editorialize</i>&quot;. Cherry-picking a detail out of the article and making it the title is the leading form of editorializing.<p>When an original title is baity or misleading, the way to rewrite it is to find <i>representative</i> language from somewhere else in the articleâ€”something that accurately and neutrally represents what it is about. There&#x27;s nearly always something there that&#x27;s suitable: it might be in the HTML doc title, the URL, a subheading, the first paragraph...sometimes even a photo caption.<p>Separately from the title, this article is an op-ed that doesn&#x27;t add any significant information and is therefore not a good HN submission, especially not on a topic du jour like this one, which is generating hundreds of different articles.')
