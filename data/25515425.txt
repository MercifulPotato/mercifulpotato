A 12 year old with basic programming skills is definitely capable of designing a better &quot;framework&quot;. Yes, everything frontend is quoted because it&#x27;s nothing more than a joke at this point. Back to react, and ignoring all the underlying problems coming from the pile of crap that is js, let&#x27;s kick things off with jsx. The fact that someone developed their own syntax(I&#x27;m not sure if I should call it syntax or markup or something else) makes it idiotic: It&#x27;s another step added to the gibberish generation. It&#x27;s full of esoteric patterns and life cycles which don&#x27;t exist anywhere in the real cs world. React alone provides little to nothing so again you need to add another bucket of 1000 packages to make it work. Compare it to a solid backend framework that isn&#x27;t js: all the ones I&#x27;ve ever used come with batteries included. The concept of components and the idiotic life cycles turn your codebase into an unmanageable pile of of callbacks and sooner rather than later you have no clue what&#x27;s coming from where. Going into the size, the simple counter example on the react page is 400kb. Do I need to explain how much stuff can be packed in 400kb? For comparison, I had tetris on my i486 in the early 90&#x27;s which was less than 100kb, chess was a little over 150kb. Christ, there was a post here on HN about a guy who packed a fully executable snake game into a qr code.')
