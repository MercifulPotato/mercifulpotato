Since they had to take the S&#x2F;U-Bahn to get to school, we got them monthly passes that let them go anywhere, anytime &quot;for free&quot;. For a 14 and 17 year old, I think it seemed like heaven. The older one would go to nightclubs and come home at 03:00 and we weren&#x27;t worried about drunk driving etc. The younger one could explore the whole city (hello, Dolores Burritos!) with her friends, or go to Idea to get art supplies, without us.<p>Getting back to Philadelphia where everything collapsed back to &quot;Dad, can you drive me to ...&quot; was depressing for everyone I think.')
