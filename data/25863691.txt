I was single for a long time and I enjoyed being single then I decided I didn&#x27;t want to be alone and it was quite easy to find someone given how hard life usually is. I would say I&#x27;ve been successful but what if we don&#x27;t get married? Or if we do what if we grow to resent each other decades down the line? I think given that I&#x27;ve been true and authentic in all my love affairs and been happy so far, that I have been successful but I need to work hard to make sure it stays that way.')
