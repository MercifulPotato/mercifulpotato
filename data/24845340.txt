Of course, this excludes any specialty software you may need that may be unavailable for Linux, but I suppose that&#x27;s not your case since you&#x27;re considering this.<p>For example changing from a low-resolution (non-hidpi) screen to a hidpi one doesn&#x27;t work that great. You want to watch netflix or prime video in FHD? Not going to happen (although, admittedly, that&#x27;s not linux&#x27;s fault but a DRM-related decision).<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that, as usual, all this is highly dependent on what one does with the computer. If it&#x27;s a laptop often used with a high resolution external screen and for on-line media consumption, the experience can be less than ideal. If it&#x27;s a working computer used in fixed conditions, the experience can be outright great. My &quot;work&quot; computer is a desktop linux with a UHD screen and I absolutely love working on it. But for random hanging around on the internet, watching a movie or whatever, I&#x27;ll grab my macbook.')
