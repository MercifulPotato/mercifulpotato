Item(by='computerdork', descendants=None, kids=[25607707], score=None, time=1609534720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605211, text='In a huge way, this person&#x27;s post seems true - from what I&#x27;ve seen being a software engineer for twenty years, many tech companies (especially those in the Bay Area) are fast paced, demanding, and stressful, even for experienced developers. It&#x27;s often an unforgiving environment where you either perform or are let go - personally have had my own equal share of victories and massive failures - And as for abuse, have had some true horror stories (a senior dev who would actively and openly attack my work at every chance they got during large meetings for months on end). But...<p>... At the same time, this is somewhat universal to most (not all) companies to some degree, <i>especially tech</i>. And the more important the work, the more stressful the environment often is.<p>Could be way off on this, but just my impression is that since they are a newly graduated PhD working at their first job, am wondering if the shock of that first position (which was also at Apple, who is known to be very demanding), was a bit too much to handle - and if you also have a bad lead, you&#x27;re in for real trouble. Apologies to this person as I wasn&#x27;t there and have no real idea on what happened, but the workplace is a tough environment more often than not.<p>Know this only an estimate, but in my humble opinion, Glassdoor is generally in the right ballpark when it comes to a company&#x27;s actual culture (how it treats its people), and 4.2 for Apple is really good - did a contract job at Stubhub a few years back, which when I worked there was a 2.8 (it&#x27;s now a 3.3). And yeah, it was really that bad. The politics and scapegoating were the most intense I&#x27;ve ever seen (got caught up on the wrong side of this majorly myself. Felt like I was in one of those targets at those Carnival games where people line up to take shots at you).<p>Yeah, and tech is ruthless but, as another person said, typically in the Bay Area it usually isn&#x27;t abusive about it. In the socially aware Bay-Area, they often won&#x27;t tell you directly that they have an issue with you like they do on the East Coast, but through silence and innuendo - you&#x27;ll feel it before they actually tell you they&#x27;re not happy.<p>And sorry to hear about this person&#x27;s visa issues, the stress this has caused my foreign friends is immense. Hope they&#x27;re okay!')
