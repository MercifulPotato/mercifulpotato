We had this same rhetoric four years ago. It&#x27;s clearly absurd.<p>I don&#x27;t like Trump, didn&#x27;t vote for him, and won&#x27;t be voting for him, but this constant over-reactive nonsense is really unhelpful. Biden is a weak candidate, perhaps the weakest in decades. Everyone that doesn&#x27;t vote for him isn&#x27;t some kind of right wing lunatic fringe figure intent on destroying democracy.')
