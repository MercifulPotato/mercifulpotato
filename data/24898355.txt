I had been mostly doing C and ASM for the first part of my career, but the department I was contracted to was going through a dry spell in terms of funding so I got moved over to work with the GPS folks. I had never worked with TCL&#x2F;TK before, and it was just such a guilty pleasure - you could slam out just about anything with it, in like no time. &quot;Oh, you need to create a system with user-customizable dashboards for satellite telemetry? No problem, give me a few days...&quot; I only worked with it for a few months, but it was some of the best fun I ever had writing code. I guess I feel the same way about react and node.js these days, but TCL&#x2F;TK was ahead of its time.')
