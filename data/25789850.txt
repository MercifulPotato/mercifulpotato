When exposed to truly trivial tooling, the problem becomes a lack of practice in the type of thinking that leads to good programs. There we see that the core of the issue why programming isn&#x27;t &quot;easy&quot; is that it&#x27;s just not.<p>It takes practice to get computers to do what you want to do well and no matter what tools you use getting to know the tools will not even take 5% of the time that you need to get to a place where you do what you want.<p>Furthermore, the clamoring that there is some sort of nefarious gatekeeping cabal keeping programming from being easy to whoever cares to shout about it is fundamentally dismissive of the actual effort and practice put in by people who used to have (but no longer have) this problem. Sometimes the answer is just that it&#x27;s not trivial thing to do and this shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to anyone. We don&#x27;t think this of math, we don&#x27;t think this of making good drawings or paintings.')
