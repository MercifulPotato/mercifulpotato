As in only shipping the react components over the wire that need to be rendered on the client for user interaction. Meaning the overall page is vanilla HTML, but some subtrees are React wired components. Complete with state management that can work between all of them. In which case I&#x27;m thinking it would be fine to mark components individually as server&#x2F;client.')
