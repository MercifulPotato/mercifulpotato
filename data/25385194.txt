You can always go back and find theories to fit your data. That doesn&#x27;t mean they will be predictive going forward. It also doesn&#x27;t mean they _won&#x27;t_ be predictive, and I would say they can form a good hypothesis for a new experiment. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s meaningless, it just lacks the power of scientific evidence. It&#x27;s comparable to a non repeatable experiment, where the hypothesis counts as a first &quot;repetition&quot;.<p>At least that&#x27;s my interpretation as a non statistician, but I think there&#x27;s a difference between statistical significance and scientific proof. The findings may be statistically significant without actually proving anything.')
