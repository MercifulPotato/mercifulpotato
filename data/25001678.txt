Making snide comments about being &quot;old&quot; or how I &quot;should&#x27;ve listened&quot; and &quot;no one is going to feel bad&quot; really doesn&#x27;t help anyone understand why IPv6 is all that great.<p>&gt; Come up with some better complaints, please.<p>The author already listed several frustrations with the protocol. Feel free to read the article again if you&#x27;d like some examples.<p>Twenty years of poor adoption world-wide demonstrates its lack of easy integration. I don&#x27;t need to argue this, you just did.<p>Also, mentioning dynamic DNS services at all in regards to trying to send an IP address to someone is yet <i>another</i> point to support why IPv6 is not an intuitive protocol to work with, even for something as simple as setting up a gaming server with a few friends.')
