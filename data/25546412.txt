It embritles metals on contact. Hydrogen fires are invisible during the day (if you see rocket engineers walking around with broom pointed forward in front of them, that&#x27;s why).<p>Personally I count on hydrogen for high energy space propulsion (either chemical with oxygen or alone in a NERVA for NTR) as otherwise it&#x27;s IMHO too much of a headache to work with in practice.')
