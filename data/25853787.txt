It was a war of extermination with scorched earth tactics with the purpose of acquiring land. It was also ethnic cleansing, otherwise today you would have Native American neighbors, or relatives of Native American ancestry, or at least a significant portion of the people you met in school or at work would be Native Americans... but I bet none of that is the case for you. I wonder why that is?<p>Why do you think it is more likely for you to meet someone of an obscure country in Oceania than for you to meet a Native American?<p>How many Native American languages can you speak, or even name? Do you know any speakers of Native American languages? Do you own a Native American language dictionary? No. None of that. Why do you think that is possible in a continent that is full of Native Americans at some point? There&#x27;s a reason for it.<p>Because they were exterminated, that&#x27;s why. Cut the bullshit. Be a man and own your history, don&#x27;t be a coward.')
