How much lower to set the bar to protect the public while still preserving individual freedom of expression is a question I feel society isn&#x27;t yet ready to answer.<p>I personally would set the bar at spreading false information. Most of the more vile efforts by demagogues to stir up violence are driven by fabricated propaganda. It&#x27;s difficult to use facts to incite violence because reality is usually too mundane for people to get violently upset about. Non-factual propaganda, however, can be as lurid as it takes to make people get violent. Keeping outright fabrications out of public view ought to help keep some of these risks contained.<p>It&#x27;s distasteful, for example, to spread <i>valid</i> statistics that connect immigrant populations with crime (in large part because such statistics, given without context, ignore integration and economic equity issues), but I feel spreading facts is less likely to trigger persecution&#x2F;violence than feeding vulnerable people with a constant information diet of lies along the lines of &#x27;immigrants eat babies.&#x27; As a result, my take on where to draw the line on political speech is &#x27;say what you want as long as it&#x27;s true.&#x27;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision_Libre_des_Mille_Collines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision_Lib...</a>')
