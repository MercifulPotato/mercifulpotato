Its size is initmitating and I only started to read it because it is a classic and I had some time on a lenghy train ride. I braced myself for a torturous read ala Dostoevsky (no offence, but I really dont enjoy his tangents). But to my complete surprise &quot;War and Peace&quot; is not only an enjoyable read, it is also extremely educating and still relevant today.<p>Of course it is set in its time, but what is brilliant about it is that it covers a vast amount of people in different positions, locations and upbringings and puts them into a vast amount of different situations. And the outcome feels realistic. Some people fare well, others dont. Most have to make sacrefices in some way or another. Some survive, some dont. Some become better of and some dont. Some deserve what happens to them, some dont. In that sense it is different than most other books.<p>Due to the war setting and its allegedly realistic description of the campaign on the ground, it feels like a massive companion to Sun Tzus &quot;Art of War&quot;. Without referring to &quot;Art of War&quot; at all (I dont know if Tolstoy knew it), &quot;War and Peace&quot; puts it into the context of politics and society, and expanding on the impact decisions have on individuals. It also show-cases the impact of &quot;Art of War&quot; principles in the strategies of Napoleon and Kutuzov and how human nature can get into the way of the best plans. In that way I recommend &quot;War and Peace&quot; as an essential read for entrepreneurs who find the &quot;Art of War&quot; useful.')
