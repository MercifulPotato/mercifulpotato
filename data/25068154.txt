Failing to do so will cause permanent damage to the screen. This is a solved problem with loads of companies using EPD for external usage. \n- Make sure you respect the maximum temperature limits - the driving board should be aware of extreme (&gt;50C temperatures) and prevent updates in those cases. There are special waveforms that extend the operating range to beyond that, but you will get only black and white updates.<p>Realistically EPD robustness is a solved problem. About 6&#x2F;7 years ago we&#x27;ve launched a product based on epaper that was water tight and was intended to be used outside (permanent mounting on desks). We did not see any problems with display. And the parking signs have been running 4 years non stop any failures in the field.')
