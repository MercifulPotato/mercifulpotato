Type inference (ML&#x2F;lisp compilers) for 30-40 years. And generics, at least in the sense of parametric polymorphism, (Ada&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Java&#x2F;ML) for about the same amount of time. As far as I can tell, the borrow checker and some features around dependent types are newish, but actually modern features are few and far between.')
