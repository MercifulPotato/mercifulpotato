I think the mistake was driven by: 1) they are relatives of mine 2) Covid19 is a tough topic, so politically manipulated that it hurts me to know that people are actually dying from misinformed decision making. Your suggestion also reminds me of the book never split the difference (saw it recommended on HN few times), about a hostage negotiator sharing his lessons learned. one was keeping your voice calm like that of a night dj. hard but probably the most strategic thing to do!')
