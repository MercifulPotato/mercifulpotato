I always recall an early case in my career, where a customer’s storage device crashed, leaving a unikernel core file. They suffered data loss so it got a lot of engineering attention. This model was old even circa 2001 and ran a DEC Alpha processor. After a week of full-time investigation by our best engineer, the conclusion was that the processor...took the wrong branch.  That was it, it just failed like a broken machine.  Which I guess is what it was!')
