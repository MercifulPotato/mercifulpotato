Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25759920], score=None, time=1610528037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25759704, text='Also, kudos to this author for not logging personal information:<p>&gt; there is panic among the ex-Parler community that all their data, even private&#x2F;deleted posts, have been scraped and archived â€” it has, just not by me. Furthermore, Parler did not follow industry standards in obfuscating EXIF metadata from uploaded images, so millions of users had their exact location logged.<p>However, I am stunned that Twitter still has not taken down the tweets from @donk_enby, the person whom this post mentions with the location logging (example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;donk_enby&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348294151712944128" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;donk_enby&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348294151712944128</a>). This account has been sharing datasets with the private information of all those Parley users widely and archiving it all over the place. Isn&#x27;t this textbook irresponsible disclosure of personal information? Doesn&#x27;t this violate all the rules of Twitter for doxxing? I&#x27;ve submitted several reports at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.twitter.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;private_information" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.twitter.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;private_information</a> but it seems no one at Twitter cares about preventing privacy leaks and doxxing when it concerns their political enemies.')
