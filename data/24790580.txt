Streaming live video isn&#x27;t simple. Multiply that times the number of users in one meeting multiplied by the number of calls, and not simple gets even more complicated. Also, big tech will do the obvious thing and make you be a member&#x2F;user of their platform. G would require a Gmail account, FB require FB account, etc. The one attraction to Zoom to me is that no account required to attend.')
