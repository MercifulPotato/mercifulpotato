After the lead student on a project leaves, the faculty, especially non-technical or not so organized ones, may not even know how to access the data anymore. Who knows what arcane scripts or processes are needed to get it in a shareable form.<p>There can also be hoops with the IRB to jump through and a lot of effort in general to give someone access to data. I had an IRB insist that all raw data be deleted after 2 years of collection anyway, so by the time the paper got published the raw data had to be deleted forever.<p>I wish it were easier to release data and replication kits, but sadly the incentives aren&#x27;t there.')
