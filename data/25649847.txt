Put a minimum age on smoking? Stop it from being advertised to minors? Ban ads in a majority of media? Put health warnings on packages? Put high taxes on cigarettes?<p>Oh wait, we already have that.<p>Short of prohibition, what new law do you want at the price of health data privacy? Health data is pretty much our last legally appointed sacred data point in the US and it&#x27;s already weak enough as is. HIPAA is great and all, but it&#x27;s still not enforced that great.
