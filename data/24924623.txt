Not all metadata can identify or profile the individual from whom the data were generated.<p>Here&#x27;s what they say on the Ad Observer website:<p><i>If you want, you can enter basic demographic information about yourself in the tool to help improve our understanding of why advertisers targeted you. However, weâ€™ll never ask for information that could identify you.</i><p>If that&#x27;s the case, then I don&#x27;t think the statement is false.
