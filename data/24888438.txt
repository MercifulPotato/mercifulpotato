Since the US media is so heavily biased toward the left and pretty much ignore any Democrat scandal (<i>cough</i> Hunter Biden <i>cough</i>), any non-democrat will be heavily investigated and the ones that aren&#x27;t cancelled are most likely honest.<p>It&#x27;s almost like a filter for the people that should be in power.  If the media was less biased, I would include Democrats as well.')
