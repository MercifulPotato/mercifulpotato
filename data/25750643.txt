In an increasingly &quot;liquid&quot; global trade market, tariffs can let you regulate businesses in your country to a higher (read: more expensive) standard (be it to protect labor, the environment, consumers, shareholders or IP) while protecting the compliant business (and industry as a whole) from being undercut by competitors in countries that don&#x27;t have those protections.<p>If effective, there can be a second order effect that pressures other countries to raise their standards as well.')
