I know, you&#x27;re thinking &quot;how can I find clothes without all that stuff?&quot;  And I&#x27;m here to tell you, it&#x27;s simple: there are fewer choices to consider.  See a rack full of a brand that thinks its logo is more appealing than your personal brand?  Keep moving.  Less choices, less option paralysis, less time shopping.<p>With men&#x27;s clothes, you can buy plain shirts, socks, etc in 3-packs (there&#x27;s few choices, but few are needed).  Women&#x27;s clothes tend offer more unbranded options, unless you&#x27;re buying athletic wear or a purse.  Casual shoes generally suck in this regard, for men and women.<p>This has been getting more difficult, of late.  It used to be that logos were embroidered on tags or patches, which were then stitched onto the clothes.  But with embroidery robots and the rise of counterfeiting, companies are making it more difficult to remove their brands.<p>edit: but practically?  Thrift shops have a wealth of logo-free stuff')
