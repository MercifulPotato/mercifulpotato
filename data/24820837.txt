Allowing AWS developers to communicate with people on Stack Overflow? Me. The creation of the `awslabs` GitHub org? Me. The core concepts behind AWS Lambda? Me. SDK features like _waiters_? Me. Publicly sharing the internal service models so that people could built new tools for AWS? Me.<p>Me, fighting against the internal Amazon culture tooth-and-nail to try to get them to do things that were in the best interests of AWS customers. Some of the most brilliant and customer-centric people I&#x27;ve ever worked with got ran out of there by management (well, one particular engineering director) after 18-24 months.<p>All the fighting led to them trying to &quot;manage me out&quot; (making my life a living hell, hoping to make me quit), so I decided to stay for a full 4 years in order to vest every ounce of my stock grants, before walking away in 2014 (six months before AWS released &quot;Lambda&quot;).<p>If things are better there now, that&#x27;s really great for the people who work there. But it was a hell-scape for me to try to bring AWS into the modern age for open-source software in such a backwards-ass internal culture.')
