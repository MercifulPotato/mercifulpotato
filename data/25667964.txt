Excellent!<p>It captures well the frustration around tech interviews.  You might be a very competent worker (sustained performance), but fail miserably during interviews (peak performance).  Ideally, you could show a body of work during your interview, but this isn&#x27;t possible with most commercial software companies.  If you are lucky to work on open source for your job, it is easy to show your work.<p>To <i>manufacture</i> a public body of work for myself, I built two open source projects and published them on GitHub. \n (Please do not read that as advice!)
