Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25855549], score=None, time=1611189703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848998, text='&gt; Bill Gates&#x27; favorite book<p>I&#x27;m not that interested in what Gates thinks a good book is. Being famous&#x2F;successful&#x2F;rich&#x2F;humanitarian isn&#x27;t super relevant to being able to identify a good book.<p>&gt; interviews with convicted murderers<p>Accumulation of anecdotes != non-anecdotal evidence. It&#x27;s interesting, but just anecdotal.<p>&gt; where people feel that they do not have access to the justice system<p>A statement that is very hard to prove. I don&#x27;t think you did, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really possible given the general replication crisis within psychology.<p>&gt; improving trust in the police should reduce crime<p>I think your evidence is once again insufficient to make the point, but I will agree that the conclusion seems more-or-less valid.<p>&gt; We should therefore predict that blacks should commit murder much more often than whites.<p>You don&#x27;t have to predict that, because it&#x27;s already well-known. As such, a) you made a trivial prediction, b) you have to show a causal link, c) you have to show that your posited cause is in fact the dominant cause of the effect you&#x27;re looking at, and d) you have to demonstrate the direction of the causality.  You haven&#x27;t done b, c or d. IIRC, there are a lot of persuasive alternative explanations for the difference in the black&#x2F;white murder ratio, all of which would have to be addressed. Since I think this explanation of that ratio is much less persuasive than other potential causes, I don&#x27;t think this point is tenable.<p>&gt; every socioeconomic group in Germany believe that poor people there are treated fairly by the justice system<p>That&#x27;s a really good bit of evidence, and interesting to think about. I will agree with you that as far as &quot;extrajudicial death penalty vs. law and order society&quot; goes, Germany seems decently representative of the latter.  However, as I mentioned above, the US side of the comparison is far less apparent: the critical piece of the logic puzzle doesn&#x27;t work.<p>After my first reading of your comment, I didn&#x27;t really expect to find holes in most of the points you made, when I made my response. Thought I&#x27;d be agreeing with you more. But here we are. It was definitely interesting. Thanks.')
