I find things in GIS and click on it, and it opens pinterest. And then when I&#x27;m in Pinterest I click on the image again because I&#x27;m trying to track down the original place the image came from, and when I click on it, it literally LOADS a Google Image Search Result page. For Google to reward this behavior must mean they no longer have anyone actually updating GIS anymore. It&#x27;s probably in permafrost maintenance mode.')
