Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603053531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24818910, text='Irrational is a stretch from being manipulated by propaganda. Definitely not my choice of word.<p>I only checked your first link, and after processing that I called it. The data is from ~1991 and 2010. The link says Western Europe. I consider the Scandinavian countries Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean Southern Europe. Southern Europe and Eastern Europe (all ex Iron Curtain) are poorer than Northern Europe, Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium (left out -- why), Austria (idem), Switzerland (idem), Sweden (idem), Finland (idem) (though last two are also Northern Europe and Scandinavia).<p>Then I scrolled to the bottom and saw this linked [1]. The title being: <i>In Western European countries studied, up to eight-in-ten adults live in middle-income households; U.S. has among the highest lower- and upper-income shares</i> and guess what the USA&#x27;s middle class is 75% the size of the mentioned non-Southern European countries.<p>Now, I happen to know also that apart from Southern Europe all of the mentioned countries have adequate healthcare while in the USA (before Obamacare, which the two statistic metrics are about) that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>My conclusion is indeed that the middle class in the USA is marginalized. Though not yet as severe as in a fascist country it might be heading that way.<p>I would like to comment on one more thing:<p>&gt; This is entirely in their interest.<p>No, it is not, only in their short term myopic vision. A long-term interest is that you invest in your fellow civilians. It is also selfish, because you expect something in return. But it is what I call intelligent selfishness as its long-term. Much like VC, the USA is focussed on short-term gains.<p>Now, surely the American people must live a happy and free life, right? Not quite. If we look at the above statistics and the data from Democracy Index, Reporters Without Borders about the freedom in all of the countries we are discussing then the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Tge Netherlands, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Ireland (ie. entire Western Europe) are far ahead in terms of freedom than the self-proclaimed Land Of The Free.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;middle-class-fortunes-in-western-europe&#x2F;st_2017-04-24_western-europe-middle-class_1-01&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;middle-class-f...</a><p>PS: As for your Fox News rebuttal see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24819418" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24819418</a>')
