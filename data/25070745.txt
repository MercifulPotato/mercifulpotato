If you have a very short and fast HTML page you might want to start pushing the assets just in case the user doesn&#x27;t have them cached. But yet, the choice is yours.<p>I wonder if the proxies would consider some sort of hybrid mode where they proactively fetch the link header and cache it (if it isn&#x27;t already cached) but don&#x27;t push it to the client. I can&#x27;t find any indication that this has been implemented or considered anywhere. Of course if your edge was much closer to the user the the origin it wouldn&#x27;t have much benefit. But it would still be nice.')
