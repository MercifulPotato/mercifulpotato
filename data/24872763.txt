Particularly vs important rivals from the last fifty years, such as the USSR and Japan.  You can argue about the distribution of the prosperity in the US, and you can argue about the political liberalism in China, but neither country is exclusively responsible for the other countries problems in either regard.<p>Both countries depend on world trade and have a lot to loose from any event (like a war) that would upset trade.  Neither country is really threatened by each other or any other power.  It is possible that this could be a situation like the United States and Great Britain, where one country passed up another in power and wealth without a need for conflict.')
