That is manipulation.<p>Exactly, I mean you could make the argument to stop selling:\n   &quot;The current price is being manipulated and is too high so we stopped our customers from selling if they mistime the market. We will resume selling when prices return to normal.&quot;<p>Edit to add from &#x2F;wsb:&quot;If you try to sell you will get fucked because who are you going to sell it to if nobody can buy it?&quot;<p>I hope there is some meaningful action by the SEC. It would be interesting to have all the trades reversed to the point when buying was stopped.')
