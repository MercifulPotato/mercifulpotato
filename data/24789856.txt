They did business loans. They tried to expand to Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, the US, and Canada. At every point they encountered new technologies and a fundamentally different set of payment institutions.<p>It&#x27;s not just payment institutions that are different, though. You&#x27;ve got a whole different regulatory apparatus, credit institutions, supporting data institutions, and consumer behavior patterns. I&#x27;ve run into major differences in culture and symbolism and more.<p>You need to account for all of it in even figuring out if expanding into a country is a good move. Then you have to puzzle out what you have that you can adapt and what you need to build fresh for this new market.<p>It&#x27;s often easy to assume that the next market over is just like yours. As you say, this is often dangerously untrue.')
