I have a friend who is entirely the opposite. She&#x27;s really into Masterpiece Treater type stuff and she&#x27;s constantly complaining about 5 episode seasons and series that only last a few of those seasons.<p>&gt;please don&#x27;t string it out for 7, 8, 9 seasons<p>Especially historically on broadcast TV, there were a lot of incentives all around to continue to milk a cash cow with a core audience who would watch it for the next 20 years given the opportunity. In addition to the networks, I&#x27;m sure many of the actors and others involved in a long-running show realize they&#x27;ll probably never have as good a meal ticket again. So screw artistic vision.')
