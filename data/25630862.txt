This is similar to what you would do with a password.<p>Also the site type and your audience makes a big difference. I wouldn&#x27;t do it on a site where folks aren&#x27;t technical.<p>But for example what about an ecommerce site where customers need to register an account + put in credit card details to place an order and then they get access to digital goods?<p>In the above case the lack of password is a benefit because it simplifies the payment form. Now they only need to put in an email address + card details.<p>And for getting access to what they purchased a slight delay isn&#x27;t the end of the world. You could even give them access to it immediately in some type of unverified way (limited features until they verify). Also it&#x27;s a slight deterrent for account sharing.')
