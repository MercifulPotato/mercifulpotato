Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606115391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183758, text='&gt; The whole point of politics is that the law does not and cannot fully capture whatâ€™s right and wrong.<p>The perfect is the enemy of the good.<p>Legislators work to try and capture what is right for now and the future, and in common law jurisdictions a claimant may (sometimes) sue and not have to wait for legislation. As I wrote, I&#x27;m not against anyone taking a positive moral stance but since there&#x27;s no way to know or even agree on what is moral, to say that it&#x27;s immoral to take no stance other than to work within the law (which is a already a very extensive moral code) would seem invidious.')
