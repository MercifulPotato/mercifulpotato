If you love solving hard problems and building products and systems from the ground up while maintaining work life balance, then we encourage you to apply.<p>GooseChase was founded 10 years ago with two goals - to connect people and teams through fun, interactive experiences (scavenger hunts!), and to grow organically on our own terms by building the team and product without any investor funding. We’ve been fully remote from the very start, and have built our culture around it. With customers like NASA, Salesforce, Harvard, Microsoft, and the Smithsonian Museum we’ve moved beyond simple scavenger hunts, but we haven’t forgotten our roots. We’re looking for smart people like you to help build the next evolution of our product.<p>Our open roles include Senior Android Engineer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;goosechase&#x2F;j&#x2F;FA255C65B8&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;goosechase&#x2F;j&#x2F;FA255C65B8&#x2F;</a>) and Senior Full Stack Engineer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;goosechase&#x2F;j&#x2F;D318D5127D&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.workable.com&#x2F;goosechase&#x2F;j&#x2F;D318D5127D&#x2F;</a>). More information about each role and our tech stack available on the specific role pages.<p>Please make sure to mention HN in your application. We look forward to hearing from you!<p>Logan Fuller | CTO')
