For years I&#x27;ve been meaning to write a &quot;programmer&#x27;s guide to 85% of western music theory&quot; article, but never quite gotten around to it.<p>The core of it boils down to stuff like:<p><pre><code>    * scales are arrays of note offsets:\n      * majorScale = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]\n    * to change a scale&#x27;s key, offset each note:\n      * dMajor = cMajor.map(n =&gt; n+2)\n    * &quot;modes&quot; typically means scales that are reindexed:\n      * dorian = major.map((n,i) =&gt; major[(i+1) % 7])\n</code></pre>\nand so on. Obviously knowing that stuff doesn&#x27;t make the music theory any more <i>intuitive</i> - if a textbook says &quot;a V&#x2F;ii chord&quot;, I have no idea what that sounds like. But deriving what notes it has, or writing a function to play them, is super easy once the terminology is demystified.')
