Facebook is just one of many doing that, the A.I. genie is well out of the bottle, and conversely Facebook could exist without that A.I. optimising for something we don’t really want.<p>However, despite that being the only point where I think you’re actively disagreeing with me, I disagree with your new point here:<p>&gt; look at some of the short term effects and foolishly conclude that it&#x27;s making things worse, focusing on antivaxxers and the like while ignoring the rise in global literacy and scientific progress and achievement.<p>These are separate <i>dimensions</i> of what I consider a good society. China is part of the rise in those two, yet lacks free speech. Does it lack all the things which free speech is a good proxy for? I don’t know; but it does lack free speech.')
