On my system without optimizations it prints &quot;xyz&quot; just fine, with optimizations it prints nothing, even though I&#x27;m accessing to the middle of memory. I think on most systems this will not actually crash unless you have explicit out of bounds memory tracking inserted into code by the compiler every access slowing down your code.<p>The point is in Rust this wouldn&#x27;t even compile.<p>I&#x27;d be curious if you ran your text editor through a memory sanitizer like valgrind and how many issues it points out.')
