It is a bunch of semi-anonymous comments on aggregated stories (which might not even be news). It absolutely should not even be considered as a source.<p>I just think a big issue is that people are ignorant about how to recognize and what it means to be a primary source vs secondary source vs opinion based in fact vs opinion based on falsehood vs something pulled out of thin air.<p>I&#x27;ve too often seen people on here make &quot;arguments&quot;, citing only some unsourced op-ed piece to back up their claim, as if it means anything. It&#x27;s exhausting.')
