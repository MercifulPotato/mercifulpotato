I can&#x27;t speak for others but my opinion on the matter remains unchanged despite who the target is. I may disagree that it was a good move, but it is, in my opinion, Facebook&#x27;s right to ban anyone it wants.<p>It&#x27;d be like if dang decided he&#x27;d had enough of me bitching about package management, bad UIs, and software bloat and banned me. I wouldn&#x27;t like it, but I also don&#x27;t believe I am entitled to force HN to host my rants.<p>I believe the right way to handle this, if you are upset about how Facebook does things, is to stop using Facebook and tell other people why you don&#x27;t use Facebook.')
