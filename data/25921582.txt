The Capitol storming was a dumb stunt that&#x27;s being milked for all the political capital it&#x27;s worth.<p>The movie &quot;Network&quot; has all the same anxieties, (our country has been bought by the highest bidder, the air isn&#x27;t fit to breathe, etc.)--if things are broken, they&#x27;ve been broken for 50 years, so I&#x27;m not convinced that the kids aren&#x27;t all right.')
