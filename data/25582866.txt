And we anticipate that the number of people killed will be fewer, hence &#x27;saving lives&#x27;. However, the lives lost in autonomous accidents will be a different set of people than those that would have died in human driven accidents. There will be cases where a court determines that the autonomous system was the cause. Families of those killed will want justice, while those separately saved by autonomous systems may never be heard from in the same case.<p>I expect that in the end it will come down to a business decision, and that decision will be informed by an actuarial exercise: Will profits and insurance be able to cover the costs of defending and settling such cases. Who knows, maybe the threshold is crossed at 5x safer.')
