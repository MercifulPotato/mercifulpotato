After he called them out, I don&#x27;t remember if he just checked their sheets and notes and let them return or if he called them to continue the test in another room under stricter supervision. I doubt that the students got wronged or treated unjustly in any way. The assistant might have pointed them out or something but I don&#x27;t really remember all the details, just the brief anecdote.')
