In effect what you have is the Sun burning a line onto the paper. This actually means that you don’t need to develop or fix the paper afterwards either. However, the final print does not last very long - the paper is still light sensitive when you take it out of the can so you need to scan it rapidly, in a dark room.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from the Solarcan (a premade product that uses the same principle) instructions:<p>&gt; Inside the Solarcan is a single sheet of light sensitive photographic paper. Once exposed to light a chemical reaction happens to the emulsion and it begins to change colour. Traditionally photographic paper captures a latent image that is not visible to the naked eye and requires chemical processing, however with a Solarcan the light from the Sun is so powerful that as it passes across the paper it darkens visibly and no chemicals will be required to ‘develop’ the image.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarcan.co.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;solarcan-the-booklet-3-web.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarcan.co.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;solarcan-t...</a>')
