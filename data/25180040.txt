Not for specific products, for like everything from now till Christmas.<p>Normally I am totally ad-blocked, but my Mac refuses to reconnect to my OSS Airplay Raspi contraption, and I just don&#x27;t feel like rebooting ( already killed <i>coreaudiod</i> ).<p>I wired up my tuner with a dipole and am listening to radio through the <i>ether</i> mind you. No adblocking though.<p>Amazon is almost absent in NL at the moment, but they will crush the competition in a couple of years.<p>Amazon should be broken up.')
