Covid-19 particles range from 0.06 microns to 0.14.  The largest Covid-19 particles can fit 2 wide straight through a N95 mask and the cloth masks that most people you see wearing aren&#x27;t anywhere close to the spacing size of a N95 mask.<p>Saying neck gaiters are less effective at stopping Covid-19 is like saying you&#x27;re safer from getting a bucket of sand thrown on you behind your screen door than I am standing behind my chain link fence.  In the end, the sand is much, much smaller than either opening, so it goes right through both.<p>The only real benefit of masks at all is catching water droplets when you sneeze, and such droplets are caught roughly equally well with the common cloth masks people wear and neck gaiters, from what I&#x27;ve read.<p>TLDR - Your neck gaiter is probably sufficient, especially if you wear it double layer &#x2F; folded over.')
