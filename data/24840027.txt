For example, if you have two parts of your code that call the same library function, and you want to know which path is the slow path...you can&#x27;t. The time reported for each line is a sum of all times&#x2F;paths it was called. Worse, the visualization tools don&#x27;t hint that this is the case, so you end up with very incorrect plots. Pyinstrument will give you the time, by path. Super useful, and a huge time saver!')
