If I made a commercial app I would pay.<p>My concern is that I don&#x27;t trust Qt Company now to not change the rules on me later, or hike the price, etc.  I would choose Qt for commercial solely because I already know it from building FLOSS apps.  If I need to learn something else for FLOSS, I&#x27;m not going to stick with Qt.  There&#x27;s limited space in my brain for expertise and I want something that will meet all needs.<p>Qt is amazing and I love it, but an amazing thing I love but can&#x27;t use&#x2F;rely on isn&#x27;t worth much.')
