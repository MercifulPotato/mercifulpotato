I did what you&#x27;re doing for a couple of years at a company that just didn&#x27;t have the leadership it took to get things fixed. I was miserable every day. Partly because on-call sucked but more importantly because I was working on a project that felt like I was shoveling quicksand. Your time, your energy, and your self-esteem are worth too much to be shoveling quicksand for people who don&#x27;t understand how to do things the right way.<p>I&#x27;m now at a company that takes these things seriously and I&#x27;m learning a ton of good habits and I feel really proud of the work that I&#x27;m doing.')
