Intangible things aren&#x27;t scarce.<p>Surely you own money?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not about the work required to create it or even the work required to copy it. The point is that it&#x27;s not scarce.<p>Right, the copying part is &quot;free&quot;. The thing that software licenses try to protect, the part which is not free, is the effort that goes into making software. The end product is not scarce, but the materials that go into it are. So the thing that these licenses are doing is slapping on a &quot;price&quot; at a strange step in the pipelineâ€“but only because copyright law is strange that way, and for open source projects it is hard to add value to the creation process anyways.')
