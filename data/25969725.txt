It&#x27;s a useful innoculation against bullshit. Someone who has internalized informal fallacies can use them to spot bad arguments in the media or from politicians, for example.<p>- They help people to avoid using falacious arguments in their own conversations. If a person wants to make a strong case for a position, at work for example, they&#x27;re more likely to be taken seriously if they avoid bad reasoning.<p>The harmful motivation for someone to be interested in a list like this is that they&#x27;re effective rhetorical strategies when used with the right audience. If you&#x27;re interested in persuading people and you aren&#x27;t very moral, fallacies can be your friend.')
