Would it go too far to say that the conversion of solar to chemical energy is the biggest aspect of farming?<p>I’d like to see the accounting for how much of the “100% renewable” energy is actual production and how much is an accounting practice that involves offsets somewhere. Maybe it is, plants don’t need lighting at night so you could use solar. But the efficiency of sun -&gt; cell -&gt; transmission -&gt; LED -&gt; plant is much less than sun -&gt; plant, it’s not a winner there. Are they attached to the grid and push more electricity to it than they draw?<p>Balancing production costs vs the carbon chain of transport is good to look at. Our springtime apples come from Chile, New Zealand, and other far-flung places. How many joules of energy went into getting that kale to your Boston store from California vs from Worcester in January? If the energy to grow to harvest is less than the energy to transport, and people really really need that fresh-picked kale in January, it’s a niche win. I’m doubtful you can make much of a dent in New England’s produce needs using New England’s available renewable energy during wintertime. But gathering evidence is better than listening to my doubt.<p>Vertical orchards- I don’t see that happening. So my apples will still be imported from across the globe.')
