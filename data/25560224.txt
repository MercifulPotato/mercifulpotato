But that&#x27;s not really a credible argument if you can&#x27;t actually use them in any practical capacity.<p>There are modern microkernels that are POSIX compliant and have a much lower footprint than linux. That&#x27;s not the problem. I think the most prominent issue, people points out here is performance. However, it&#x27;s very obvious to me that the extra abstraction of having a kernel vs having no kernel on an constrained device costs performance, and it&#x27;s always a trade-off, both solutions can be found and both solutions are valid.')
