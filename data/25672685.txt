I just want to make sure that it&#x27;s clear why proactively preventing vote fraud when there historically has been much isn&#x27;t as simple as it sounds.  My parents are all about voter IDs and other measures because they have only heard one side of the argument, that it is possible.  What they haven&#x27;t heard about is the cost to these laws.<p>Epistemologically, that&#x27;s why I believe these discussions should be evidence based instead of theoretical or ideological. We don&#x27;t do a good job of figuring out what is going to work and what is not going to work until we&#x27;ve tried some stuff out.  And it needs to balanced.  There will be a few people who will try to cheat the system.  As long as they get caught and it doesn&#x27;t affect the election, that&#x27;s ok.   There will be a price to pay in legitimate votes who are unable to cast a ballot because of whatever countermeasures we put in place. The question is, did we strike the right balance?')
