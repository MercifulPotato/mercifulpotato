I also only needed it to test one site I was developing. I had the exact same things he did: MBP slow even when nothing is running, WindowServer always running high. So I think I can vouch for it being true. It seems to have worked for me also.<p>EDIT: Maybe it&#x27;s just placebo. I checked the CPU usage on WindowServer before and after deleting &amp; restarting.')
