Yes, unions are imperfect and American unions often especially so. But why be limited by past history? Why couldn&#x27;t a new union based in a comparatively young industry write new rules and determine new practices? Why be limited by the problems of the past? That&#x27;s what is so puzzling about tech critics of labor unions; if we think we can innovate upon and disrupt every other damn thing, why do we also insist that labor unions will inherently experience the same set of problems? And if labor unions are so bad, why not at least propose something new that could address the problems that they were intended to solve?')
