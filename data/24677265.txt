I base my screencasts off lessons I&#x27;ve learned running my software product over 10+ years.<p>- tradeoffs rather than overconfidence in trending principles<p>- I also add in a softer, more business-oriented twist, based on my own background as an independent software entrepreneur: my screencasts have a strong focus on what it takes to market a piece a software, to help the users who&#x27;ll benefit from your software actually discover it and take a chance with it. This translates into videos on SEO, Analytics, AdWords etc.<p>My YouTube channel is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC17mJJnvzAa_e9qQqLIfIeQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC17mJJnvzAa_e9qQqLIfIeQ</a><p>I have double as many videos, along with show-notes, on the accompanying website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semicolonandsons.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semicolonandsons.com&#x2F;</a>')
