That&#x27;s why companies spend so much money on advertising.</i><p>That&#x27;s a &quot;motte and bailey&quot; defense of advertising, though. If the stated main objective of connecting (existing) buyers and sellers were true, almost all ads would be restricted to opt-in forms like trade shows and catalogs (be it paper or digital). After all, it makes sense to let a buyer self-identify before spending money and effort on informing them about your wares.<p>The actual primary objective of most advertising, as demonstrated in the real world[0], is to <i>create</i> new buyers, and recapture those you buy from your competition.<p>&gt; <i>The problems with digital ads is that they are deceptive, clickbait, annoying, (...) ugly (...).</i><p>That&#x27;s started <i>way</i> before digital. Check out pictures of some old newspapers or billboards from a century ago - that was &quot;clickbait&quot; 100 years ago too. It does read strange (all that presumptuous and grandiose language), but it&#x27;s only because we&#x27;ve became culturally immune to that kind of wording. More recently, I&#x27;d argue TV ads were and are the worst - the current form was refined into pure and unadulterated brainwashing. On-line at least mostly spares us that.<p>--<p>[0] - &quot;The purpose of a system is what it does&quot;. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_purpose_of_a_system_is_wha...</a>')
