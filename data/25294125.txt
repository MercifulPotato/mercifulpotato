Item(by='feanaro', descendants=None, kids=[25294266], score=None, time=1607026571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292292, text='&gt; Bitcoin has been around for about a decade now. It didnâ€™t take anywhere near that long for the <i>internet</i><p>That&#x27;s not true, as is obvious with only basic fact checking. Apart from it not being obvious what you mean by &quot;internet&quot; (does ARPANET count?), the internet proper saw its first commercial access providers appear in 1989[1] and it certainly was nowhere near popular in 1999 as it is now. In fact, I would say the change from that period is almost fundamental. Remember, 56k modems were popular back then and a very small part of the world&#x27;s population had internet access.<p>My point is, this certainly fits into the larger picture of where Bitcoin is right now. It&#x27;s vastly more popular then 10 years ago, because now my plumber and barber ask me about it, it is regularly talked about in the news and there are almost no countries without laws enacted as a response to it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rogerclarke.com&#x2F;II&#x2F;OzI04.html#CIAP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rogerclarke.com&#x2F;II&#x2F;OzI04.html#CIAP</a>')
