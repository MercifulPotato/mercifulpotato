It was promised and that promise was never fulfilled. Why? Because Germany and France don&#x27;t export many services.<p>Even selling of goods and services online only started to be paid attention in 2015, decades after the single market for goods, and the EU has mostly made things <i>worse</i> for online sellers via things like its VAT rules, which are horrifically complex to implement. Basically you can&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s so complex, so you have to get a dedicated third party company to process the VAT stuff for you, which imposes costs on everyone.<p>Meanwhile the only thing that came out of their supposed digital services market strategy was a highly controversial change to copyright law, the product of vast amounts of lobbying. In Germany it was so controversial it even led to a bomb threat!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market#United_Kingdom_position" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_...</a><p>Things that could actually make it easier to sell the sorts of services that the UK is strong in never even made it to the table. Instead there is a very vague set of general statements in the treaties that don&#x27;t mean anything, leading to lots of very silly court cases, like when someone selling a laser tag game in Germany bought laser guns from the UK and residents took them to the EU courts, arguing that &quot;human dignity&quot; meant that this service should be restricted. And the courts agreed.<p>Really, who has time for this kind of stuff? The EU has time to standardise banana straightness (read my other post) and kettle power levels, but the basics of &quot;can I open an entertainment business in another country without being shut down by bizarre legal arguments&quot; isn&#x27;t there.')
