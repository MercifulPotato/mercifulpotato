I don&#x27;t care if you have solved wicked problems before, it&#x27;s all talking and hand-waving. Can you take a hard problem, and apply CS concepts and good ole problem solving to produce working, succinct and well written code? That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re being hired to do, stop complaining.')
