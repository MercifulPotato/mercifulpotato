My parents started getting worried at some point. I still remember a good chunk of the dialogue.<p>My parents sent me to my grandmother&#x27;s during summer break, but they also allowed me to take my 386. I wrote DOS games in Turbo Pascal the entire time, and only saw my grandparents at mealtime. Then I got a talking to because of the monstrous electric bill a 386 running 24&#x2F;7 racked up.<p>These days I use Android Studio,  which could really take some notes from TPX.EXE.')
