That’s a really emotionally charged and completely invalid reach.<p>I’m not sure how a reasonable conversation can continue.  We’ve moved to a Twilight Zone alternate reality at this point.  The only way we can go further in to la la land is to make a completely invalid comparison to Nazism so that Godwin’s Law can be invoked.<p>Another thing: Discarding what a judge says about a what <i>is</i> legal matter is not a particularly compelling argument.  It’s the kind of thinking done by people who believe in conspiracy theories.  As a contemporary example, people who are convinced that the 2020 United States presidential election was rigged, when pointed out that judges have concluded there is no reasonable evidence supporting that assertion, will say something like “I couldn&#x27;t really care less what the judge concluded”.')
