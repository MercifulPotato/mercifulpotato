That&#x27;s literally it for me. I do use VS Code quite a bit for more complex refactorings, but I do use vim for quick edits to files + initial development.<p>Edit: should say, I also do a lot of work on remote Linux boxes, often supercomputers. Vim is the only thing I can guarantee is installed - Emacs often is not.')
