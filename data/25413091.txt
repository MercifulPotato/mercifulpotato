Not much happens.<p>Till then I had read&#x2F;watched Bond and similar fiction. And John le Carré was different. The complexity, uncertainty, deliberation, etc. was far better IMO than Bond&#x27;s action and cigarettes.<p>It was like watching Morse after Jack Bauer. And while saying one is better than the other is probably a matter of taste (&quot;Bond lit his 70th cigarette of the day&quot;), I liked le Carré more.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tinker_Tailor_Soldier_Spy_(miniseries)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tinker_Tailor_Soldier_Spy_(min...</a>')
