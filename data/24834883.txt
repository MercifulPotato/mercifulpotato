However, since they are logged into the Discord app, their real account also joins the server when they launch the app from the browser.<p>I&#x27;m pretty keen on sharing this knowledge because I recently realized I&#x27;ve done this myself, and it took me way too long to figure it out. I &quot;started&quot; using Discord a few months ago, and in one of the servers I joined, I saw an account with an oddly-familiar username that joined a server about a minute before I did. And then I saw the same thing happen in another server! After a few weeks of having a weird feeling about this, I finally found out that in my browser, I was logged into a dangling account I created back in 2018, before I really knew what Discord was. (I think back then I thought Discord was just a voice chat service without permanent accounts.)<p>I would love for Discord to solve this and a few other identity management-related issues!')
