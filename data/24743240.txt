It is not right that political beliefs should be punished like that.  Ideally they shouldn&#x27;t be punished at all, they should be tolerated but simply lose an election.<p>You can&#x27;t claim to &quot;protest for democracy&quot; while being happy to facilitate murdering people who vote for the other side!  That would be mad hypocrisy.<p>- Killing a police officer whose crime, even if violent, fell significantly short of killing someone themselves.  Punishment should fit the crime, not be 10x worse.<p>You can&#x27;t claim to &quot;protest for justice&quot; while being happy to facilitate extra-judicial killings that aren&#x27;t even based in justice.<p>- Killing an innocent person who is mis-identified, whether by accident or not so much.<p>See above.<p>The third point, killing an innocent person seems even more likely due to automated facial recognition software like what&#x27;s running on Facebook, with its biases and a mask to add more noise too, integrated with deepfake image reconstruction technology to produce convincing &quot;unmasked&quot; images, combined with vigilantes often not being too bothered about accuracy and statistics.<p>However wrong or right you think it is, surely everyone agrees it&#x27;s wrong if it ends up getting the wrong people.<p>But no apparently.  I&#x27;ve spoken with people in other situations (at other times) who said, basically, it&#x27;s ok for &quot;a few innocents&quot; to die if that&#x27;s what it takes to rid the world of guilty people.  And others taking the view that it&#x27;s ok for &quot;police&quot; to die because police are bad.  Both views strike me as boneheaded AF.<p>It is clear AF from the reports that the Belarus authorities think it&#x27;s ok for some number of innocents to die and suffer for the sake of policing and intimidation.  If I were there I would certainly want the <i>authority</i> to &quot;die&quot;, by being thoroughly dismantled asap.')
