My experience with LastPass has been miserable, from functionality to UX it&#x27;s just a bad product in my opinion. I do wish the Windows client for 1pass was a little more polished, but it does have all of the functionality I expect and the UX is generally the same as macOS it&#x27;s just a little rougher around the edges.')
