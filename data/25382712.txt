For languages with a common package repo, how many other packages depend on me? With NPM, for example, it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out how many other packages depend on a given package.<p>2. For &quot;top level&quot; projects, look at downloads.<p>My guess is just looking at either (or both) of those metrics would give you better results.')
