Comparing Honda America&#x27;s website and Honda Corporate&#x2F;JP&#x2F;CN&#x2F;EU websites shows increasingly divergent values and interests.<p>This is not something unique to Honda right now either: Nissan America also looks like an entirely different company to the rest of the Nissan Group. At one point Ghosn was trying to rebrand Nissan America as Datsun (again) and jettison the whole thing from the Nissan Group as a ticking time bomb of backwards detritus (deeply focused on a lucrative past of large energy inefficient vehicles with little brand recognition for energy efficiency). Obviously, that plan probably went out the window with Ghosn&#x27;s whole weird situation, but Ghosn probably wasn&#x27;t wrong in that Honda America and Nissan America at this point are liabilities&#x2F;anchors weighing down their parent companies and where their parent companies now see the future of the industry. Unfortunately, Honda America and Nissan America currently still are profitable enough that they can afford to continue to ignore their parent companies and not start turning the ship in the right direction.')
