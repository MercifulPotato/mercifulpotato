You can do store extensions in Nightly, but you now need a firefox account to do so. (And you have to press secret invisible buttons, not joking.) Non-store extensions are apparently canceled.<p>It&#x27;s a power grab all the way down. We wouldn&#x27;t make excuses if Google did that and we shouldn&#x27;t make excuses if Mozilla does it.<p>Current Mozilla does not behave in a way that would demonstrate that they are a good steward for Firefox or the open web.')
