But ask them how they feel about folks in Washington D.C. deciding what goes in the school curriculum in Sibley, Iowa.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s all fine. But I don&#x27;t think social science research supports the idea that rank-and-file (or self-identified, if you prefer) conservatives in the US are actually motivated by a devotion to, say, Federalism (as opposed to, say, hegemonic masculinity, white nativism, etc).<p>There is newer social science research suggesting that tests used to measure for attitudes such as &quot;white nativism&quot; (e.g. racial resentment tests) instead measure for conservative beliefs. Thus, the results don&#x27;t change if you change the survey questions to ask about white people or other groups instead: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;renos&#x2F;files&#x2F;carneyenos.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;renos&#x2F;files&#x2F;carneyenos.pdf</a> (p. 17) (&quot;Three important features are prominent in this figure: First, conservatives respondents (white boxes) show more resentment toward all groups than do liberals (gray boxes). Second, for conservatives, the distribution of resentment is nearly identical when asked about a white and Black target group to the distribution when asked about any alternate group, except with a slightly lower median.&quot;).<p>Questions purporting to measure &quot;racial resentment&quot; often presuppose a larger societal or government role for addressing racial inequality. Opposition to such programs is deemed &quot;racism&quot; but could also just be opposition to government programs generally. Only about half of Black people themselves support government programs to address the economic conditions of Black people: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;the-roots-of-black-political-unity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;the-roots-of-black-politic...</a> (see Figure 0.5 a-c). 62% of Black people say that race should not even be a &quot;small factor&quot; in college admissions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;most-americans-say-colleges-should-not-consider-race-or-ethnicity-in-admissions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;most-americ...</a><p>To use your examples: what does &quot;hegemonic masculinity&quot; mean in this context? Is your test for &quot;hegemonic masculinity&quot; also going to return positive results for people who just believe in traditional gender roles (including women)?<p>What does &quot;white nativism&quot; mean in this context? My in laws in exurban Oregon are frustrated that their school is suddenly 30% immigrants who speak a variety of Latin American languages that aren&#x27;t even Spanish. They want Trump to enforce the border. Are they white nativists?<p>By your metrics, is Angela Merkel a white nativist? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;worldviews&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;angela-merkel-multiculturalism-is-a-sham&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;worldviews&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;12&#x2F;14...</a> (&quot;Multiculturalism leads to parallel societies and therefore remains a â€˜life lie,&#x27;&quot;).<p>Is Emanuel Macron? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;researchportal.helsinki.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;publications&#x2F;france-has-never-been-and-never-will-be-a-multicultural-country-s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;researchportal.helsinki.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;publications&#x2F;france-ha...</a> (&quot;France has never been and never will be a multicultural country&quot;)<p>Or are you just defining &quot;white nativism&quot; to mean &quot;anyone who opposes mass immigration that changes their community&#x27;s culture?&quot; If my family back in Bangladesh was faced with the same sort of mass immigration (from say Myanmar) as my Trump-voting in laws in Oregon, their reactions would be identical! What a lot of people deem &quot;white nativism&quot; is the pervasive belief among people around the world that they have the right to preserve the culture of their communities.')
