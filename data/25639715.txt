But gets rid of a very heavy piece, and makes it easy to build a shock absorber.  The downside is that you&#x27;ll need to replace platforms any time one of these misses, hence the need for a <i>very</i> precise landing.<p>(The landing already has almost no margin of error given that they land with a suicide burn.)')
