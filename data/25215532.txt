My first thought reading their story was &quot;They must&#x27;ve used their discord token in some unusual way.&quot;<p>... which is exactly what I&#x27;ve been doing too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tyrrrz&#x2F;DiscordChatExporter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tyrrrz&#x2F;DiscordChatExporter</a><p>Do you happen to know: Is there a risk of Discord banning me for using that tool to automatically export chat logs for processing via a bash script?<p>Basically, it&#x27;s a tool to convert discord servers into json.<p>Their official wiki gives instructions for using your <i>personal user token</i> rather than any bot &#x2F; API token: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tyrrrz&#x2F;DiscordChatExporter&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tyrrrz&#x2F;DiscordChatExporter&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Obtaining...</a><p>I admit, I used my personal token without giving it a second thought, even though I should&#x27;ve known better. I haven&#x27;t been banned, but this story reminded me that I should be careful. Am I being overly paranoid? Is it fine to use your personal token in situations like this, where it&#x27;s basically a CLI tool?<p>Also, I run a discord server for ML with ~1k users. If I get banned by Discord, will server ownership transfer to someone else? Or will the whole server get knocked offline too?<p>Feel free to ignore this if you want -- I&#x27;m merely asking in case you happened to know. Happy thanksgiving!')
