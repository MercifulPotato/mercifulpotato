And even if search and replace was slower overall, you might be looking at a difference of minutes over a period of decades (i.e. it wouldn&#x27;t actually matter in any practical sense).<p>Far too often I see people spend days to save 2 seconds (and then proceed to not realize the savings over a long enough timespan)')
