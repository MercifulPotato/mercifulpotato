Maybe open source isn&#x27;t the panacea we thought in this particular context.<p>Even now Firefox doesn&#x27;t feel like an open-source project in the traditional sense; it feels like its culture is still Netscape. It&#x27;s still very much owned by a corporation that does most of the development.<p>Konqueror shows that a proper open-source browser is or at least was possible. It always had an order of magnitude fewer developers than the competition, but was able to keep up by using better tools and frameworks and relentlessly keeping the code clean. Even today I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it received more outside contributions than Firefox.')
