Requirements change, libraries update at a breakneck speed.<p>That&#x27;s a forced metaphor as well, not actually an identical process. If &quot;requirements change&quot;, that&#x27;s not the same thing as a bolt rusting away. Surely the requirements for the rusting bolt didn&#x27;t change, or the requirements for its &quot;dependencies&quot;, i.e., the things it&#x27;s attaching together.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve had to deal with some (functional) languages that don&#x27;t allow you to change the the variable where some would allow that sort of modification just fine for your simple example.<p>I completely fail the relevance of <i>that</i>. Or maybe it <i>is</i> somewhat relevant, but in the completely opposite way, i.e., that this phenomenon does not even have an analogy in the physical world, thus underlining the vast differences between software engineering and classical engineering disciplines. (Likewise the dichotomy between a computational procedure and the process generated by said procedure, the latter being constrained in the way you describe, doesn&#x27;t exist in traditional engineering either.)')
