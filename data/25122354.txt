Long story short, I will allow for something even better, but lets keep it a secret for now :) Having said that, I do believe this will come in an about 3-month timeframe, since it is indeed very hard to implement :)<p>&gt; Perhaps the ability to create pixel area adjustment layers (that sit over top of the video) with filters and then be able to apply those template layers only to a certain set of frames.<p>This should also be there, again, my take right now is we&#x27;ll have a BETA version of this in an about 3-4 months, and I assume it will take an additional 3-4 months to make it stable. Yes, it is very hard to implement ;)')
