I don&#x27;t know if this is enough for them to make up the difference on lower sales, but it&#x27;s surely a factor in how many people buy iphones.<p>I also really don&#x27;t really understand the attitude that this is a problem. Apple could half their current sales numbers and still have a massively profitable business that most people could only dream of. As long as that lower rate was sustained then there isn&#x27;t really a problem for the company.')
