I also want to emphasise I&#x27;m posting this out of genuine interest, not contrarianism or antagonism.<p>Is there overlap between your <i>philosophical</i> layers and practical utility? The kinds of things that have been required to change in my career so far were base assumptions in the business domain, which no amount of premature abstraction could have prepared me for.<p>I&#x27;ve never witnessed a need to &quot;swap out&quot; an entire layer. Have you? In what scenario did you need to swap out... what exactly? Did these philosophical abstractions turn out to be the correct ones when a need did arise? Did they make the transition to the new reality easier? Does the transition cost outweigh the slower development cost incurred from the abstractions&#x27; overhead?<p>I keep seeing people claim your approach is a good one, and I&#x27;m genuinely curious if there is any evidence backing it up. I&#x27;ll gladly take anecdata.')
