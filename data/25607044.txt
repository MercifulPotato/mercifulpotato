It&#x27;s still inefficient, but since it is using waste heat it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; energy so to speak. Saudi Arabia has built such plants. The Soviet Union also built a fast reactor that was cooled with salt water, which was condensed and used as a freshwater supply [1].<p>Since ~80% of the world population lives on the coast, using seawater as coolant and capturing the condensate could represent a substantial source of freshwater.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BN-350_reactor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BN-350_reactor</a>')
