There is at least one costumer who won&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t) pay a penny more than they are currently paying, and &quot;experimenting with prices&quot; would be like telling them: &quot;well, go away, there&#x27;s a guy here in line with more dough than you&quot;. \nGiven the very-skewed distribution of wealth, this line of thought leads to very expensive services for the rich, and the poor having to leave without them (housing market, I&#x27;m looking at you).')
