Walmart absolutely has negotiated deals in the past for products that appear to be the same but are not.  Levi&#x27;s jeans is one example.  They tried to do the same thing with Snapper, as I recall, but were rebuffed.<p>If that&#x27;s okay with you, great, you are matching the price of the product with the quality.  But as a result of them doing it and not being completely transparent about it, I question what other products they&#x27;ve done the same thing with.')
