Item(by='usr1106', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606299484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207172, text='I have a ticket open for 1 year. They have escalated the issue several times, but no real answer. In the meantime the ticket could be declared invalid because they have changed the implementation but they haven&#x27;t even done that. Shows that their ticket process is not working. Even worse, the underlying problem is unfixed, they have not updated the kernel for C1 instances for 2.5 years and there is no supported way to run your own one. So they keep charging for an unsupported product (if customers are stupid enough to pay...). They seem to have not enough technical staff and they prioritize new development over support. They are cheap for non-critical use, but I would not trust them for anything business-relevant.')
