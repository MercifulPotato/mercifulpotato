There is nothing about the basic building blocks of microeconomics that makes it incompatible for the analysis of luxury products.<p>Most product are not luxury products and a large portion of the world lives in poverty, so naturally most Econ 101 discussions of microeconomics will deal with commodity products e.g. bread.<p>Like anything worth learning, it is far more important to understand the basic principles of the subject than to learn details about specific applications.
