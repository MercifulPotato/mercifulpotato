The Times author apparently did not read the EAD he cited. I&#x27;ll quote from it the relevant bit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MAX-AD-1107.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MA...</a><p>&quot;Initially, higher control forces may be needed to overcome any stabilizer nose down trim already applied. Electric stabilizer trim can be used to neutralize control column pitch forces before moving the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches to CUTOUT. Manual stabilizer trim can be used before and after the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches are moved to CUTOUT.&quot;<p>Note that the flight data recorder showed that both crews had moved the trim back to normal with the trim switches, and neither thought to then turn it off.')
