What about incitement to murder? If Trump said something like &quot;I think people should take their assault wepaons to Washington DC and kill Joe Biden.&quot; Incitement to murder in this case is speech, but it&#x27;s criminal speech, ergo speech cannot be entirely free. Effectively what I&#x27;m saying is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to be as cut-and-dry as you&#x27;d like it to be.')
