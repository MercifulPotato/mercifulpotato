I’m pretty sure it can’t, because it does not update the firmware of the main system controller. You might end up with an unbootable copy of Windows if you’re unlucky, but it’s fairly easy to fix it with install media or a recovery partition, and you might be able to recover any data your backups don’t cover (you make backups, right?). If you don’t have any install&#x2F;live media for Windows or Linux, it’s trivial to make those with any working computer (Linux, Windows, macOS), including a friend’s. But if a macOS update nukes your T2 chip’s firmware, you need access to another Mac and the appropriate cables.')
