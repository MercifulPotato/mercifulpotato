As devs we&#x27;re used to the idea that, e.g., any app we run should be able to modify any files that belong to us, regardless of whether we asked it to. But that&#x27;s actually an insanely lax security model.<p>It&#x27;s honestly not hard to disable any security settings that are getting in the way. I run whatever software I like on my Mac, no problems.<p>People have been talking about how Apple were going to lock down Mac OS &quot;real soon now&quot; for at least a decade. There&#x27;s no real indication that it&#x27;s ever going to happen.')
