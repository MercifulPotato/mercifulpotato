Sure, I managed to stand up a handful of small &quot;test&quot; side projects, two of which are now small businesses - however I actually struggled more to immediately apply myself at my day job while working remote.<p>I know the immediate comments will be - focus on your job not side projects, this is obviously why you struggled to buckle down on &quot;actual work&quot;.  However, I would say that my day to day work gives me more stress and &quot;pushing myself&quot; just lead to further meetings and stress being more involved with other people&#x27;s problems.<p>Like a few other commenters here I received an ADHD diagnosis in my early twenties - for this reason college was a significant challenge.  My deepest moments of &quot;pushing myself&quot; have come from trying to escape situations or life circumstances that make me deeply unhappy.  Supposedly, ADHD sufferers commonly focus anxiety like this - however, this is certainly my vice.  Being able to gauge risk and make hard decisions with this anxiety is great - but it comes at a huge personal and social cost.')
