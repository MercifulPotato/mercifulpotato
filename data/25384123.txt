The fact that alternative app stores can exist does not mean the App Store cannot or will not be used: many developers (myself included) would probably still use it because it is simple, easy, built-in, and handles many things for you. The issue arises when it is the <i>only</i> app store, so it no longer has to compete on features–what incentive does the App Store have to improve the app upload experience? None, really. And, finally, the tools Apple gives you to develop your apps are the ones they use themselves, and you could argue that they should be taking this money out of their iPhone sales anyways.')
