People can and do use it for hardware, but it&#x27;s not a great fit.  In the article they talk about some of the challenges like the building blocks of most electronic designs (i.e. chips, passives and other components) not being things that can realistically be covered in the license.  And the fact that a lot of the more interesting &#x27;hardware&#x27; actually needs to include both hardware and software (i.e. firmware).  I&#x27;m sure patents are another area that are at least a bit different with open hardware since it&#x27;s almost impossible to source a microprocessor, for example, that isn&#x27;t covered by numerous patents.')
