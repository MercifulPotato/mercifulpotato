If it was as wet as he claims I would not have a job anymore in Austin where 99% of my income originates. Lack of public spaces off Bee Caves ? Are You  crazy, this is my main area of work. You must never have found Commons Ford Park.<p>Nowhere to go ? Hah, the main activity in Austin is down at the lakes, it&#x27;s 100F outside in summer so everyone heads to the lakes, or the beach is just 3 hours away.<p>Rudeness ?
