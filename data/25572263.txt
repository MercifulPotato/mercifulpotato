If you let that leak out it won&#x27;t flow downhill through the city, it&#x27;ll go straight up. Of course you can argue that gas is dangerous, but not by example of an accident where most of the flammable material flowed away (and caused harm elsewhere) instead of either burning or exploding at the site.')
