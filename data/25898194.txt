Item(by='gweinberg', descendants=None, kids=[25898487], score=None, time=1611539698, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25897095, text='Sure, but it&#x27;s not to hard to think of examples of things which signalling theories would say shouldn&#x27;t happen. For example, people should not be impressed by signals that are known to be easy to fake or that are in no way impressive in the first place.\nThis may seem trivial, but it does have implications. For example, if you claim &quot;I did X over the weekend&quot; and I reply with &quot;I call bullshit&quot;, it implies not only that I doubt your claim, but also that at least to some extent I care whether it is true, and also that you care whether I believe you  or not (or at least that I think you care).')
