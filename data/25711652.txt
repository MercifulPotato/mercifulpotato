Yet this is always ignored.  By always, I mean I cannot think of a single case where I&#x27;ve seen the side doing the calling out realize that it was reversible on them.  I have seen a number of memes from third parties calling out the two major sides as being reciprocal double standards, if that counts for anything.')
