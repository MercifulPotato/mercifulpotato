It feels like trying to use a schoolchild&#x27;s classroom writing desk as sufficiently large for multiple papers and books kept open all at once, and not a work desk of proper size. High resolution displays are such an enormous quality of life improvement that it&#x27;s entirely worth it to buy new hardware to drive the resolution.<p>I do empathize with the author that laptop hardware quality isn&#x27;t like it used to be.')
