Or vary how you combine the master PW and the domain (i.e. count the number of letters in the domain and insert the domain starting with that number, or each letter of the domain that many characters appart embedded into the master PW.)<p>Or...just use random passwords, a password manager, and make sure you both trust the provider of the password manager (or use one you control) and use a super high security password as your master password in addition to other forms of authentication. And never let it allow you to stay logged in to your password manager.')
