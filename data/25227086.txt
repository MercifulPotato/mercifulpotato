Item(by='teekert', descendants=None, kids=[25228639], score=None, time=1606470628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221812, text='This:<p>Manager: Can I give you some feedback?\nDirect: Sure, boss.\nManager: When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?<p>Is soooo American (or maybe more countries?). All this tells me is that the boss of the manager is a whiny micromanager and I feel like the boss of the boss needs to be informed, I mean why would you ever bring someone into trouble over bad news. Bad news are just facts. What&#x27;s this trouble anyway?? It&#x27;s such an hierarchical chain of events. If the nature of the bad news is such that the boss really does get into trouble, then it&#x27;s time for some open and honest discussion on how to do things better from now on. Nothing negative about this imo.<p>I mean the whole idea that you somehow need to discipline colleagues by giving them &quot;trouble&quot; is just ludicrous to me. Why not just assume that everyone around you is a smart individual with good intentions and that errors sometimes happen and we can bear the consequences together. Man this gets me worked up.')
