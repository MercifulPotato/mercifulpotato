That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s appropriate to use as a checksumming algorithm - the results are repeatable. Bcrypt on the other hand does not generate the same result every time by design due to it using a randomly generated salt.<p>However, if you did hash with sha2 the first time, you may end up regretting that decision if sha2 collisions end up being possible and&#x2F;or practical.')
