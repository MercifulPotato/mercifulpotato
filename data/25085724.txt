The few lines of direct evidence suggest that it&#x27;s possible they help a tiny amount, but we haven&#x27;t been able to detect much evidence of this, either way. Only by combining multiple (poor) studies together, pooling the data and statistically re-weighting the pooled results was the WHO meta-analysis able to find any signal at all, and the signal wasn&#x27;t strong:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economicsfaq.com&#x2F;retract-the-lancets-and-who-funded-published-study-on-mask-wearing-criticism-of-physical-distancing-face-masks-and-eye-protection-to-prevent-person-to-person-transmissi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economicsfaq.com&#x2F;retract-the-lancets-and-who-fund...</a><p>In 2020, we&#x27;ve had a number of studies that attempt to use statistical analysis of infection data <i>from late spring</i> (when cases were declining in the northern hemisphere) to draw conclusions about masks, and a handful of anecdotes that are repeated frequently by the media -- the Missouri hairdresser, the Korean Starbucks -- that were neither controlled, nor subjected to statistical analysis of any sort.<p>The only randomized controlled trial conducted on masks for personal protection against Covid -- the highest quality form of evidence for a health intervention -- has been completed since June, and rejected by three major publications:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04337541" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04337541</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berlingske.dk&#x2F;videnskab&#x2F;professor-stort-dansk-maskestudie-afvist-af-tre-top-tidsskrifter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berlingske.dk&#x2F;videnskab&#x2F;professor-stort-dansk-ma...</a><p>Moreover, as we have now seen, most of the places around the world with mask mandates and high rates of self-reported compliance are experiencing spikes in infection. At the very least, these call into question the publications that attempted to make claims based on data from the spring.
