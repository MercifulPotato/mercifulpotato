It&#x27;s a really nice time to be an introvert, chatting away on some IRC channel or playing video games in your brightly lit, warm flat, looking out into darkness and cold and seeing the dozens, or hundreds (or a few if it&#x27;s really late), of the windows lit up - every one a person or a family. You have a strange sense of connection and an extra cozy, safe feeling.')
