Worse yet, eye strain lasts for days just like a migraine.  Switching from a 1080p monitor to a 4k monitor with a reasonably low dot pitch, minimizing video game playing, and hunching (looking at a laptop screen, looking at a cell phone), helped me massively.  Oh and blackout curtains are a godsend if the sun rises or sets in the general direction of the room you&#x27;re staying in.<p>I went to a chronic pain clinic, and I was glad I did.  When you lay in bed too long (especially when females do) the muscles deteriorate and this in itself causes chronic pain that can at times be difficult to distinguish from a migraine.  I had to go to a physical therapist and it helped tons.<p>A pain clinic will prescribe antidepressants, because they often will work for all kinds of chronic pain, including migraines, but sadly for me they only worked about the first month and then became ineffective.  However, I did learn from that the best anti-depressants and anti-anxietiants in the first world outside of the US (because pharmaceutical companies can&#x27;t make a profit off of it) are RIMAs [1] and are absolutely worth perusing if you have depression.  Out of pocket they&#x27;re about $20 a month, and they can help with pain too.<p>And on top of all of that, turns out I get migraines from allergies.  I&#x27;m unfortunately highly allergic to every grass and tree allergy allergists test and a few of them cause migraines for me.  Second, I&#x27;m allergic to soy which causes a severe migraine response, so I&#x27;m constantly cautious.  It was an allergist of all people who helped me get on the right migraine medicine.  The allergist I went to dubs himself an allergist when other allergists fail, and does food allergies too.  Unfortunately, my allergies haven&#x27;t gone away, but at least I know a cause for my migraines.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moclobemide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moclobemide</a>')
