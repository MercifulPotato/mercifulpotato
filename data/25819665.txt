There seems to be an implied expiration for doses, but a single day doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>The result of both these together is that they are supposedly letting people not scheduled to get the vaccine get it on some days. The article calls them &quot;walk-ins&quot;.<p>Apparently word of this has been spreading slowly, and in this case went viral and a ton of people showed up to attempt to get some small number of &quot;leftover doses&quot;.<p>It seems like chaos to me and a failing of sensible procedure. I am not though a doctor or involved in the distribution process so what do I know. Perhaps there is good reason this happens.')
