People could self-study, his tutors, or attend university.  Even mix them up.  It&#x27;d be like transfer credits.  I could see a cottage industry of tutors and specialized labs, because the accrediting organizations&#x27; standard exams let them honestly say, &quot;We can help you with part of your degree.&quot;  Internships wouldn&#x27;t have to be coordinated with universities; good employers would assign enough work relevant to the exams.<p>Universities would still be a useful service: pay the tuition and get access to a bunch of professors (bonus if they take on student research assistants), other students, labs, research material, the &quot;university experience&quot;, and (let&#x27;s be honest) prestige.  Universities could even provide venues for exams, like with the GRE (which is a standard exam administered by a central body).<p>Another real-world example is the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.  Anyone can register.  I self-studied and took the N5 (easiest) exam in 2019.  After that, I realized I need some help to keep progressing, so I&#x27;ve signed up for some paid online education services.  When the pandemic passes, I&#x27;ll look into getting a tutor.  If local universities offered Japanese courses, I&#x27;d gladly pay to sit in.')
