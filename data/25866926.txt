Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[25867039], score=None, time=1611277369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863438, text='&gt; The workflow for modern scientific research always seems so amateurish from the perspective of basic software development.<p>It&#x27;s sad but it&#x27;s true. Although there are fundamental pressures that come because academia is academia, I pretty firmly believe that this can be fixed culturally too.<p>Ultimately, I think people in some fields enjoy programming but view it to be either beneath them or beneath their paper. This is clearly not the case for Computer Science, but I noticed a few papers in the tire society journal which presented promising results but with absolutely no source code.<p>One slightly ugly truth is that a lot of academics don&#x27;t really know how to program properly or how computer actually work (Again, outside CS for obvious reasons). I&#x27;m reminded of the Imperial Covid Model&#x27;s bugs as a fairly easy example.<p>As to culture-question - the obvious solution is to start <i>requiring</i> disclosure of almost all materials and data used to construct a paper - for instance if Hendrik Schon had to publish the data behind the curves in his graphs his fraud could&#x27;ve been spotted almost immediately.')
