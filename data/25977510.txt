A year after graduation, we rented a house along with my buddy&#x27;s brother and my buddy&#x27;s elementary school buddy.  We were always drinking bubble tea from a kiosk in a mall within walking distance, so the brother one day decides to see what the fuss is about.  He mentioned &quot;Hey, I tried that bubble tea you guys are always drinking.  It&#x27;s pretty good, except for the chunks.&quot;')
