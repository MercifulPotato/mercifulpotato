In my case we&#x27;re spending an inordinate amount on power currently, because we&#x27;re using upwards of 20kW &#x2F; day.  Part of that is a horribly inefficient hot water system, part of it is needing an air conditioner this time of year (here in Australia).<p>The new system will include a smart meter changeover, which means hot water can be off-peak, and time-constrained, and air-conditioner will be used primarily during the times that we&#x27;re generating power.<p>Combined with some other plans - adding a shade-roof over one of the existing poorly insulated structures, replacing the HWS with a heat pump, etc - I expect that we&#x27;ll be close to power-positive most sunny summer days when we&#x27;re on-site, and every non-cloudy day that we&#x27;re not.<p>Payback for my neighbour was ~ 3 years, though he <i>was</i> more extravagant with his air conditioner <i>because</i> it wasn&#x27;t costing him anything to put it  on.  I expect a similar or slightly faster payback period.<p>In which case - it makes more sense for me to do this immediately.   Whether it would have been the case 3 years ago, I&#x27;m not so sure.')
