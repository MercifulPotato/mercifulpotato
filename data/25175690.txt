The long pathway leading into the loop from the left of the poster is glycolysis, which produces a small amount of energy in the form of ATP and creates pyruvate which is then fed into the citrate cycle.<p>I can&#x27;t figure out where the electron transport chain is however, but I suspect it is part of the stuff inside the citrate cycle loop.<p>If you want a clickable, but slower loading, version of this you could try KEGG: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genome.jp&#x2F;kegg-bin&#x2F;show_pathway?map01100" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.genome.jp&#x2F;kegg-bin&#x2F;show_pathway?map01100</a>')
