You can find great arguments, for instance man pages are searchable inside, but also you can search for manpages containing given keywords (man -k). My shell (fish) autocompletes man pages: when I enter `man gi`, it tells me that I can see the git manual, or for instance, GIMP manual. The first thing I do with a program is to open its manpage. When it isn&#x27;t available, all I can think is that it was written carelessly. If you want to have interoperable software, you absolutely need to provide manpages.')
