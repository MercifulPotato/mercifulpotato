I have a bad habit of buying old hardware without checking if the documentation had been made available on the web.<p>Recently I found myself desperate for any information on a price of hardware i had gotten. I was swapping out all sorts of queries woth different keywords hoping to find a manual. I was able to find some marketing material which was helpful, albeit barely. Eventually I had exhausted the search results for most pf my queries, gave up and assumed that it was simply lost to time and I was out of luck.<p>Eventually I went back to the sales paper I found. Going to the site it was hosted on, a Lithuanian reseller. I translated the page, eventually finding a direct link to a user manual on the exact same page as the sales paper I had found. The document was in English, contained important words from my queries (such as the product name, company, &quot;user manual&quot; etc. The document was at the same path as the sales paper too. I hace no idea why Google found the sales paper but not the manual.<p>Unfortunately the manual still wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for <i>exactly</i> but it was a hell of a lot better than what I could get from Google&#x27;s results.')
