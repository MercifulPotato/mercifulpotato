This is a sign of a healthy ecosystem and generally I think it&#x27;s working  well.<p>However systemd, by rolling this functionality into systemd subverts that system and the vast majority of systems will just accept the defaults.  It also makes systemd huge and complex, last I looked there was somewhere around 5% of the lines of code in systemd than the entire linux kernel which I find scary.')
