It feels like the sky-high valuations of technology companies and Bitcoin are &quot;shock absorbers&quot; of sorts, or early signals of inflation-yet-to-come. If we assume the market is efficiently pricing these assets (like AirBnB&#x27;s IPO) then it could very well be that the actual value of a fiat dollar has dropped dramatically -- making sky-high valuations more reasonable -- and we&#x27;ll only see that reflected in the price of consumer goods and commodities once industry leaders collectively feel comfortable the economy is on track again. After all, you can only charge what consumers can afford to pay.<p>I&#x27;m an armchair economist at best. I just can&#x27;t make sense of the market right now, and wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the price of things like groceries, beer and travel double or triple what they were in 2019. Is there anybody writing about this that I haven&#x27;t been paying attention to? Am I missing something?')
