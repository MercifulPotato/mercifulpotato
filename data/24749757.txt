I do own a car after all.<p>Part of it is that I&#x27;m just addicted to cycling. But I&#x27;m also not strong enough to be a competitive cyclist, and don&#x27;t live in an area with extensive mountain biking. So I have to look for ways to make it more interesting. I also love being outdoors during the winter, so I also go cross country skiing, or just take long walks.<p>Surely, folks who have engaged in real survival sports would laugh at me, but still, arriving at work on my bike at -20 F feels like I&#x27;ve been on some kind of an adventure. My friends think I&#x27;m crazy, but I remind them that regular people go to work, outdoors, in colder temperatures, and they survive. The old saying is: &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.&quot;<p>On the other hand, my spouse has a job where you have to pay extra for parking, so she either rides her bike or takes the bus depending on schedule. Right now during the COVID, the bus service has been cut way back, so it&#x27;s 100% bike for her. My kids are both college students, and don&#x27;t have cars, so a bike is their only option.')
