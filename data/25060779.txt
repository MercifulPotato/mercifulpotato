It&#x27;s dangerous, but so is drilling into a gasoline or LPG tank. Car mechanics are trained on this topic, they know.<p>Compared to current battery-in-a-box construction methods, I expect that for crash safety the embedded battery may actually give more structural rigidity, and more freedom to incorporate crumple zones on tactical places.')
