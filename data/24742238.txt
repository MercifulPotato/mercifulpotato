I worked as a CS TA as well, and I found that to be true. The top 2% of students already had practical skills (shell, vim, git, networking, etc), usually because they&#x27;ve been coding since they were 12 and learned by doing cool projects. Sometimes I saw bright students without prior experience picking up those skills quickly (much quicker than I did).')
