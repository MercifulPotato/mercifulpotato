Such an archaic ugly language. OMG why didn&#x27;t they replace it with C#&#x2F;JAVA&#x2F;whatever yet. Who would learn an obsolete language? It&#x27;s a dead end as a developer.<p>Well guess what, it most likely will outlive every other language and framework created in the last 10 years by a large margin.<p>I just wish it would pay better to attract senior developers. The language is easy, but it has to be a real challenge understanding all of the interconnected processes and that requires a lot of experience. Surely there are many who would choose a COBOL job over learning a new framework every 2 years.')
