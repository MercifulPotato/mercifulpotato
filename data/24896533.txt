It can&#x27;t be DRM, obfuscation is never a valid measure to restrict access. The purpose of obfuscation is the opposite, it makes sure that you can still for example run the obfuscated code, but it&#x27;s just hard to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>The reality is that there is no &quot;circumvention of protection measures&quot;, like RIAA is claiming. Youtube provides a javascript to decrypt their cipher, youtube-dl runs it just as intended and that&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s just what a normal browser does.')
