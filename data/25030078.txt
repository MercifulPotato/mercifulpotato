Item(by='ppf', descendants=None, kids=[25031300], score=None, time=1604878268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029818, text='It&#x27;s a nice, techie-sounding idea, but there isn&#x27;t enough lithium in the world to make that many batteries. It also has the downside that most people with cars expect to use them daily, and not find they have been depleted while in use as grid storage. There is also the related issue of excessive charge cycle wear on those batteries.<p>The energy harvested from a wind turbine (or solar panel) is quite small compared to the energy required to make that generator, when compared to the equivalent figures for a fossil fuel plant. I just don&#x27;t buy the idea that renewables are cheaper sources - just looking at the energy returned on energy invested, power produced will be more expensive. That&#x27;s ok, because us humans should learn how to use drastically less energy in our daily lives, but it doesn&#x27;t help to pretend that it will make energy cheaper.')
