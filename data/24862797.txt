Now, a chunk of that money gets sent down to lower levels of governmentâ€” Waterloo region where I live recently received $600M from upper levels of government for a light rail system that is now built and operating, and the current budget shows 27% of revenue coming from &quot;provincial and federal grants&quot;.<p>The thing is, that money which comes from the upper levels is extremely subject to the whims of those governments; it can fluctuate wildly depending who comes into power and what their priorities are. So without some guarantees around it, I can understand the municipalities wanting a stable source of income over which they have some agency, and out of which they can reap immediate benefit from growing the local economy.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d love to hear from someone in Germany how this is resolved there; but I&#x27;d assume there&#x27;d need to be some pretty structured, long-term agreements around minimum amounts, percentages of new growth, and so on.')
