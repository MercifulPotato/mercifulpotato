Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.<p>I assume this means they waive certain modern safety regulations in order to allow companies to make new cars (in low volume) that resemble old cars?<p>&gt; That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine.<p>That makes sense.  If ever there was a car that looks like it should be an EV, it&#x27;s the Delorean.  They could even do a stickshift EV if they wanted to, though most car companies seem to not think it&#x27;s worth the complexity&#x2F;maintenance, and I get the impression that electric motors are hard on transmissions.')
