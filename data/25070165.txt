There are stronger versions of the argument that race defines everything you do, even though I disagree with them. But this publication is pretty in line with the popular view that &quot;doing anything while white is problematic&quot;. You may be familiar with it in the context of moving house: move to a cheap neighborhood? You&#x27;re gentrifying. Move to a good neighborhood? You&#x27;re segregating.
