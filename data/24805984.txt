This is quite a pertinent example.<p>I think Popehat is great, sometimes, but I also like HN&#x27;s anti-snark guidelines because it brings the conversation up a level.  Would I have made the same choice as dang today?  Maybe not.  Do I appreciate his transparency?  Yes.  Do I agree that it fits with the site guidelines?  Yes.<p>As for the comments... I&#x27;ve read them a few times throughout the day.  And lemme tell ya, folks are <i>rarely</i> responding to the Popehat article.  But, given that the Popehat article was essentially a bunch of links to other articles after a couple of snarky paragraphs framing the issue, that&#x27;s not too bad.  At least one dead comment was griping about Popehat.  Womp womp.<p>Was the change made without the explicit consent of every user?  Um...  Yes.  But what entitles us to that level of control over HN?  This isn&#x27;t a direct democracy, it&#x27;s a news aggregator.  This site also allows us to edit our comments, without the explicit consent of every person who responds to them.<p>Would it be appropriate to sue HN into oblivion over this?  Please, oh please, no.')
