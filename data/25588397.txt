Item(by='blululu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609377105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586810, text='Nigeria is the largest country in Africa. The population is ~200M (~60% of the population of the US). 1M people is only 0.5% of the total population of Nigeria, so it is not a stretch to imagine that number of people engaged in cyber-crime. When you consider that Nigeria&#x27;s population skews young, and the country is filled with a lot of very intelligent, well educated people, who don&#x27;t have a chance of landing a six figure salary working for a FAANG company, it does not seem unreasonable to expect people to make a living doing something that is not totally ethical (even people with all the opportunities in the world go on to work as corporate consultants).')
