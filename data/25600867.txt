To me, that was a sign that they must know what they&#x27;re talking about. It turned out to be the opposite. These days, I try not to blindly follow the advice of anyone who can&#x27;t demonstrate their knowledge to me in some way; if you&#x27;re telling me how to paint a picture, you better be able to show me one of your paintings.')
