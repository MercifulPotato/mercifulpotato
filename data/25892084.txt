My best plan is to pull them working systems and deal with them missing.  I don’t think it’s a good use of resources to buy extra DAQ cards just for a regression test bed.<p>Regardless of that, moving from python 2.5 to 2.7 is not trivial because not all used libraries were even updated to 2.7 from 2.5.  Some that were broke backwards compatibility.  How far do I have to bend backward just to get in the right place to update to python 3?  I see many comments trivializing the effort needed to update to python 3 because they know of narrow use cases and expect large amounts of resources to maintain code.  That isn’t the reality for most users.')
