We refuse to fence users and lock them in.<p>This is a very interesting take! I completely agree with it. While it may not work for many but one of the biggest mistake I made was I&#x27;ve used &lt;4 letter name&gt;@mailbox.org extensively. But I am making an active effort to change that and remove it from use completely.<p>This is kind of a hidden lock in. Because there&#x27;s no free email service unlike Tutanota where you can keep using email on their domain in reduced capacity.<p>Same for Posteo. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>I will eventually move away from Mailbox. I will be watching Migadu. Though 20&#x2F;day out can be limiting. Though it&#x27;s rare I&#x27;ve sent 20 mails per day but there has been days when I did.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.migadu.com&#x2F;procon&#x2F;#no-mailbox-2fa-yet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.migadu.com&#x2F;procon&#x2F;#no-mailbox-2fa-yet</a><p>I do not agree with the tone here. Yes, IMAP doesn&#x27;t support 2FA but I&#x27;d want the Migadu control panel interface to be protected by 2FA. I like how Mailbox has handled it.')
