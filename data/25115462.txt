Let that sink in. Out of EVERYONE in this country, only 1700 have died under 35<p>That&#x27;s the wrong way to look at it.  How many people over 35 in the USA have died or was hospitalized because an under-35 was a link in the transmission chain?  How many people under 35 have expereinced short or long term medical harm because of an infection that didn&#x27;t manage to kill them?')
