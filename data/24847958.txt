Item(by='yboris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603288959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845991, text='Thank you!<p>1) Current &#x27;delete&#x27; function sends things to the recycling bin (safe!) but does not work on network drives unless you &quot;enable recycling bin on network drives&quot; (some setting on the OS). I have added &quot;dangerously delete file&quot; which does a &quot;rm&quot; command instead - it will be released with version 3 of the app. Until I release, you can just build the current code which has this feature already.<p>Thank you for the suggestion about file metadata. This discussion is probably better as a GitHub Issue. I&#x27;m a little unclear about the scenario you describe. The app will not remove videos from the &quot;hub&quot; even if a source folder (like external drive) is not connected - it will just have a small icon indicating &quot;not connected&quot;.<p>Cheers!')
