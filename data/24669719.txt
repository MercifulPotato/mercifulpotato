Did not compare these two side-by-side but generally HDR is what sells 4K TV: a small (&lt;80&quot;) TV does not benefit from higher resolution, IMHO. HDR on the other hand, is a huge difference (and even on a regular SD signal a &quot;smart&quot; TV can usually blow up dynamic range with some image processing).')
