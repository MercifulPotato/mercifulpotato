It&#x27;s the actual cultural hegemony of the website. You can only be le ebin ironic nazi for so long before you&#x27;re actually a nazi.<p>&gt;I can go to &#x2F;x&#x2F;&#x27;s catalog page and see maybe 1-2 posts about le jewish nazi conspiracy theory, with less than 10 posts<p>50% of threads in &#x2F;x&#x2F; devolve into jewish conspiracy theories, or otherwise fascist-inspired rabbit holes.<p>&gt;There&#x27;s a thread on &#x2F;lit&#x2F; right now about African writers with a lot of recommendations. It&#x27;s 4chan,<p>Lmao nice, you found a 2 day old thread, after the jannies were able to clean the overwhelming amount of &#x2F;pol&#x2F;tards that infested it. And even after the obvious ones got filtered out, there still remains the unspoken weight of genetic essentialism<p>&gt;It&#x27;s 4chan. As always, you wade through the shit to find the interesting stuff. It never existed to service you or your sensibilities.<p>&gt;your sensibilities<p>When 75% of the sensibilities of a website are in one way or another related to National Socialism, you cannot have a normal discussion anymore.<p>&gt;Sorry not sorry that your point of view is so narrow that literally any mention of Nazis triggers you. That&#x27;s the nature of 2020 shitposting. You got filtered<p>Yeah there&#x27;s a small difference between &quot;a mention of Nazis&quot; and literally every discussion that tengentially mentions someone who isn&#x27;t white being approached with the entire cultural baggage of a Nazi, complete with phrenology and all.<p>There was a time where this was just shitposting, then the shit-posting got more and more intense, and then people started reading Evola &quot;for the meme&quot;, and then people started quoting Hitler speeches to justify why this or that is wrong, and then the (((jew))) started being jokingly referred to as the cause of all society&#x27;s ills, and then someone went into a mosque right next to my friend&#x27;s house and killed 6 people, right as it was getting irony-posidoned into the zeitgeist, half of them earnestly accepting it, and another quarter &quot;&quot;&quot;jokingly&quot;&quot;&quot; absorbing it. It&#x27;s not a new concept, you know, this is a well-studied phenomenon.<p>&gt;Hiroshima Nagasaki&#x27;s incompetence is the one genuine cause of the downfall of the site. He wants money, and he&#x27;s severed ties with 4chan&#x27;s other referrals and sponsors for better deals. Not even J-List was willing to stick around. The site is more or less managed by a dedicated team of mods and janitors, with Hiroshi occasionally changing a few lines of code on the backend and fucking things up. He hasn&#x27;t even figured out how to take down &#x2F;qa&#x2F; yet, which was a board moot temporarily created to answer questions when he left. I don&#x27;t (fully) fault 4chan&#x27;s community for this. I fault the owner.<p>Hiro being the only person stupid enough to take on 4chan is a direct symptom of what I call the &quot;sprit of &#x2F;pol&quot; and later also &#x2F;pol&#x2F; itself and by extension a good half of the website became, certainly now that &#x2F;b&#x2F; got cleaned up and they are all intensifying there. It&#x27;s exactly why m00t sold 4chan, and exactly why only a complete idiot would buy it, and also what it made it completely radioactive. It&#x27;s a consequence of the social process and the exponential increase in anti-social behaviour, toxicity and general puke that led to hiro coming to own 4chan, it&#x27;s nothing but a symptom.<p>&gt;Thank you for taking the most obvious of obvious baits, and proving once again that you got filtered.<p>A bait too obvious, too often for too long isn&#x27;t bait, its a real belief in the process of being irony-poisoned onto the dominant worldview.<p>&gt;I think it&#x27;s best to just stop here. You clearly have a chip on your shoulder and any mention of 4chan&#x27;s impact on the greater cultural sphere of society will be met with scrutiny<p>I don&#x27;t have an issue admitting 4chan had a huge impact on the earlier internet culture, and as a result some extant impact on the greater culture in the anglosphere. It did. Just not anymore. That era is over. 4chan as a cultural powerhouse is very much dead. There is nothing of value coming from that website anymore. You can&#x27;t notice it yet, but it&#x27;s just stuck in a downwards spiral which was predictable since 7 years ago and it gives nothing but predictable results. You just lack the d√©tachement to see what it is, what it was and where it&#x27;s going. You&#x27;ve also been talking about how it is somehow creating new insight in going beyond liberalism. It isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s literally going through the exact same process the Fascists did after WW1, producing the same bankrupt and useless conclusions as a result, in the exact same quest. It&#x27;s not avant-garde, it&#x27;s simply pure decay of people that can&#x27;t survive anywhere else and cannot produce any sort of cogent result because they lack of awareness of the process they are participating in. It&#x27;s now nothing but a dead end, and has been since ~2013.<p>Talk about changing the goalposts. Your original argument is that 4chan&#x27;s general culture is apart from &#x2F;pol&#x2F;, and hasn&#x27;t been consumed, and that 4chan is somehow a driving force for creative content on the internet, and that it was some kind of nice, prison-banter like place where no one really cares what you are if you can make a good point. You&#x27;ve failed to make any kind of proper case on that, and pivoted to absurd claims of being a &quot;tourist&quot;, &quot;filtered&quot;, or whatever. The only thing you&#x27;ve been able to state that did anything except fall a kilometer flat on it&#x27;s back was claims that it did a lot of things for internet culture over five years ago, and some nebulous claim that it&#x27;s at the forefront at some kind of cultural revolution against liberalism that you will not be able to substantiate because all it&#x27;s been able to do so far is to repeat the shit points of bankrupt between-WW1-and-WW2 philossophers but with slightly more modern slurs. It&#x27;s a dead end, you know it, I know it, you just can&#x27;t bring yourself to admit it because you&#x27;re in so deep you can&#x27;t even recognize the classic process of ironic disconnection into the loss of your worldview and then a reconstruction based on what you previously thought of as a just a joke.<p>It&#x27;s odd, you kind of remind me of another German I used to chat with on IRC, in a channel somehow related to crypto, in your writing style, but somehow not in intellect. Good luck.')
