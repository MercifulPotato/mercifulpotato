It required real work of a scarce-ish resource (software dev time) to create that software. You could make the argument that software, unlike a physical good, can be copied at almost no cost after creation; however, acting as if all forms of IP are &quot;owning an idea&quot; is a weird take.<p>I&#x27;d like to put forward the argument that software _patents_ are the IP that most closely resembles the IP the author seems to hate, and the source of much of the troubles associated with IP in the sofware industry. Additionally, abolishing software patents is a realistic short team goal we can work towards, while abolishing all IP is too extreme to get the average developer on board with.')
