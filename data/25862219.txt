So sort of automation service, but for one specific application.<p>&gt; Are you doing some kind of mineral oil top layer to prevent evaporation<p>The opposite: the process is pretty much based off of dessication (plus a little bit of tube opening by the bots for important chemicals). For thermocycling stuff, I&#x27;m planning on just using Opentrons module with the reusable seals. I really wanted to find a way to use reusable seals everywhere, but I just couldn&#x27;t think of a way to do it well robotically. Thankfully, I don&#x27;t need to convince the regulatory bodies of anything, since I&#x27;m just doing DNA cloning.<p>&gt; We have an opentrons that we bought couple years ago\nIf you need to do multichannel stuff, do yourself a favor and go buy Gen2 multichannels and toss your old Gen1. The Gen1 multichannels are hilariously unreliable, but the Gen2 are pretty solid. Love those bots overall though - I got two of em so I can work in parallel!')
