You say &quot;I expected the republicans to be crushed, they weren&#x27;t, so it must be true that the democrats didn&#x27;t perform well.&quot; I think a lot of democrats did the same - but it wasn&#x27;t truly realistic.<p>I&#x27;d say the republicans were beaten pretty badly. I think they are at their worst point in decades. They managed to get their largest turnout ever, and didn&#x27;t even flip the house. States that were red for decades flipped blue. And if the two runoffs are losses, that is a devastating blow, losing all levels of the federal government. 50% is not 50% without the white house.<p>I don&#x27;t think the memory of Trump will go away that quickly. This election mobilized a lot of young voters, and now that they&#x27;ve seen their vote got rid of him, they will be more motivated to vote again for more progressive agendas, or against more radical right wing ones.<p>I don&#x27;t think the rural republicans (Which is really where trump got most of his boost, anyway), will come out the same for a Mitt Romney. They want the guy who isn&#x27;t afraid to tell it &quot;like it is&quot;, be anti-BLM, etc. That is a major rift in the republican party that will further impact who they put up as candidates - and more rejection from the suburbs and cities will come.')
