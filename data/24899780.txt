It&#x27;s a very nice guarantee, but it comes at a complexity cost, usually a performance cost (although there are clever ways to approach the perforance of a non-consistent system), and in particular it means the filesystems can&#x27;t be used when the network connection is down.<p>There is another property called durability, which you might also care about.  That affects whether you get corruption when devices fail or are rebooted suddenly.')
