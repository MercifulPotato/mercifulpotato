It&#x27;s hard to quantify, but it set the tone for the community with friendly, intelligent, and experienced people.<p>As a new member, that led to an amazing first-time user experience where I got high-quality answers to every question I posted.<p>And now I&#x27;m motivated to help out other members just as the first members helped me.<p>Launch revenue is great, but it won&#x27;t survive unless it gets this right ^^')
