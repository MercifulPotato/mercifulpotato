Item(by='coremoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611153743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842769, text='&gt; How much do hospitals cost where you live? I&#x27;m not saying that this person wasn&#x27;t an asshole, but for many people, they see no point going to the hospital if it&#x27;s going to leave them in the red.<p>This happens even in countries with universal healthcare - the &quot;needing money for a cab to get to the hospital&quot; is a well known scam; the dedicated ones learn how to keep a wound open and bleeding constantly. (There was a notorious one near where I live, who managed to keep a bone exposed, allegedly - never seen him, so can&#x27;t comment further on that).<p>In London, at least, my understanding is that most homelessness is a mental health issue; support is available, but not necessarily wanted.')
