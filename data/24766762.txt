I know one member of the standards body and he is an excellent software engineer, a subject matter expert, and just wicked smart too, and he still confesses he doesn&#x27;t really understand C++. There&#x27;s a reason why Google doesn&#x27;t actually have C++ as a supported language, but rather a curated subset thereof that&#x27;s governed by their house style guide.')
