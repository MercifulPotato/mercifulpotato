Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25429846], score=None, time=1608035172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429390, text='&quot;Analogous&quot; generally means similar but not the same; if it&#x27;s a normative description it&#x27;s underspecified, whereas the &quot;if and only if&quot; description of the semantics of == and != for pointers is definitely normative. I&#x27;m sure the standard could be clearer but I do think there&#x27;s only one defensible interpretation.')
