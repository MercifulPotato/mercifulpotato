Slack seemed to be having it&#x27;s own issues. Notion is having an outage as well. But otherwise, it&#x27;s not widespread and none of the AWS services my group runs are having any issues. Sometimes these are coordinated DDOS attacks, but I can&#x27;t imagine who would target Slack, Notion and Hacker News.')
