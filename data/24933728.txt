Everybody should remember Bush&#x27;s coke problems.<p>You are right that there&#x27;s a double standard, but I don&#x27;t think that double standard is where you assert it is.<p>I mean, has there been <i>any</i> investigation of the intelligence response to Russia having bounties on US soldiers&#x27; heads? And you think that &quot;any small thing&quot; by Trump gets investigated?<p>Four years ago we were obsessing over emails from the Clintons, which Trump would have us believe were worthy of jailing Clinton.
