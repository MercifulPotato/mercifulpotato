The rich don&#x27;t store value as currency, so there isn&#x27;t any transfer of value because they don&#x27;t own this kind of asset, just like inflating dollar does nothing to my euro holdings. Actually, since the only thing rich people own that&#x27;s denominated in currency is debt, rich people get richer thanks to inflation. Inflation is making it worse for poor people; rich people would have stopped it a long time ago if it made them lose value.')
