I feel for Iranians in Iran (I know many, whether they call themselves Persians or Iranians as expats is their choice and I respect that).<p>Having had the opportunity to meet the former in their homeland so so long ago, many Americans do not understand how grueling the sanctions regime system is for average Iranian citizens in their everyday; this is sadly a minor example as I saw based experiences a decade ago. It does not impact government officials as much as we hope, and the citizens are far, far less empowered to force government change to break free of a system sanctions hopes to disincentivize (I will not even waste time here, Google and look, even recent attempts lead to backlash).<p>As a Westerner, and a lover of HN, I would love to see data-driven examples of sanctions actually working. Was South Africa are only positive example from US sanction strategies? I will go look, but this is one of many examples in Iran of us causing resentment and confusion for citizenry and not really helping. (For Americans, this is a not a red-blue problem if we talk long-term approach, all political parties have sided with sanction strategies in the long-term for a while: Cubans and Iranians we have punished and it has not really seemed to help us _in the long-term_ shifting their governments and policy objectives, but I would love to see evidenced counterpoints.)<p>The first time I was struck by this perverting are efforts in explaining open society to citizens of countries with indifferent governments was a decade ago, when SourceForge did the same thing. We respect the rule of law, but to spite the faces of democratic cultural principles. Oh well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1073903" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=1073903</a>')
