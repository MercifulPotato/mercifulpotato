Item(by='bonoboTP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602356681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24741005, text='&gt; thereâ€™s a surprising number of fresh grad candidates who are not very skilled with theory nor practice.<p>Is there any &quot;entrance point&quot; where people don&#x27;t complain about this? Companies complain universities don&#x27;t prepare students. Universities complain that first-year students come out of high school without necessary background. High schools complain that elementary school does not prepare their entrants etc. Elementary schools complain kindergarten doesn&#x27;t prepare kids to be mature enough. Kindergarten probably complains that parents don&#x27;t prepare the kids enough.<p>Broadly speaking, I think there is more demand for highly skilled, highly intelligent people than can be produced by any given cross-section of the population born in a given year. Sure, universities could do better, but beyond a certain point teaching doesn&#x27;t work. There are people who are intrinsically motivated and soak up knowledge and seek it out in books and online (so much high quality content can be found online, especially for CS!), and there are those who just coast and do the bare minimum. I don&#x27;t think you can radically improve the outcomes by changing the curriculum.')
