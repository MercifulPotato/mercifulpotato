Item(by='craigacp', descendants=None, kids=[25534830], score=None, time=1608867951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531679, text='It&#x27;s weird to me that people build libraries on top of the ML stack to track provenance, when it&#x27;s really the ML library&#x27;s job to do that for its inputs. However it is a right pain building it into the ML library as it affects all the interfaces. We build data, model &amp; evaluation provenance objects into our ML library, Tribuo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tribuo.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tribuo.org</a>), as a first class part of the library. You can take a provenance and emit a configuration to rerun an experiment just by querying the model object. It is built in Java though, which makes it a little easier to enforce the immutability and type safety you need in a provenance system.<p>edit: I should add that I&#x27;m definitely in favour of having provenance in ML systems, and libraries layered on top are the way that people currently do that. It&#x27;s just odd that people aren&#x27;t working on adding that support directly into scikit-learn&#x2F;TF&#x2F;pytorch etc.')
