I still had the toxic mentality of “just push through”, and therefore a lot of the personal work I did was incremental.<p>The very first thing I did was reduce my workload. It was probably still too much, but at the time it was unthinkable to stop working entirely.<p>Sleep, diet and exercise were next. Diet was nothing crazy, but I just wanted to eat consistent meals (I was massively underweight). Unfortunately I also had to come to terms with the fact that I am part of the population that needs at least 8 hours of sleep. I really wish I could manage on less sleep, but it is what it is. I’m also not a huge fan of running, but it massively reduced the amount of depressive and anxious thoughts, so I kept doing it.<p>After those changes I found that my energy levels were much better than before.<p>The next phase was completely mental. I hated that I failed at something, and had to learn to forgive myself. To be honest, I am still working on that. Also, I was terrified of burning out again, and went through a weird phase of over thinking and analyzing everything. Turns out it was analysis paralysis. Experimentation&#x2F;tinkering helped with that. It also helped me relearn how to learn, and how to enjoy work again.<p>A therapist probably would’ve sped up this part of my recovery, but I hated admitting that I had a problem that I couldn’t solve myself. Very toxic mentality and one I still face to this day.<p>I also recently started journaling. I’m not overly consistent (working on that!), but it forces me to take a step back and evaluate my mental state at the time of writing.<p>It’s an ongoing process, and there are probably a lot of steps I’ve missed. However these were the major goals that I had, and achieving them definitely helped. It’s very cliche, but forgiving yourself and being honest with your capabilities is crucial.<p>Hopefully someone reading this can take something away from this. Burnout is no joke, and it has permanently changed my life.<p>TL;DR: \n1. Reduction of workload. \n2. Prioritize physical well being (food, exercise, sleep), and being honest with my body. \n3. Improve mental well being.\n4. Start experimenting, and relearning how to learn&#x2F;work.')
