They had students register the mac of their devices (wired and wireless). So they identified students by mac. With this it was actually pretty easy for a bad actor to frame someone else by just changing their mac to another device on the network.<p>Same school would also lock your university account after 3 bad password attempts and you could only unlock in person at the library help desk. Again you can see the problem.')
