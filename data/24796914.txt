It’s both great and awful at the same time. Great in that it was written as objectively as possible and concrete. Awful as in it was too long and he clearly put too much time in to it relative to how much the other guy valued him.  I think the real purpose was to process his feelings and list out all the wrongs - I just think he should’ve separated them. Spend hours processing, spend no more than 15 min giving this jack off feedback.<p>Also hindsight is 20&#x2F;20 but if you work with an asshole it’s not your responsibility to shield him. Escalate to the other board members and have them deal with him.  He clearly values their respect so one of them (or better all of them) needed to sit him down for a talk.')
