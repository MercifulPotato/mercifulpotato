Also, LAMBDA before LET.<p>MacCarthy writes, in <i>History of Lisp</i>:<p><i>I invented conditional expressions in connection with a set of chess legal move routines I wrotein FORTRAN for the IBM704 at M.I.T. during1957-58. This program did not use list processing. The IF statement provided in FORTRAN1 and FORTRAN2 was very awkward to use, and it was natural to invent a function XIF(M, N1, N2) whose value was N1 or N2 according to whether the expression M was zero or not.</i><p>Yet, no such thing was added to Lisp, initially. The 1960 Lisp 1 Programmer&#x27;s Manual only lists COND.')
