It is unrealistic in practice for a patient to know or understand the process by which claims are made (since they are made by an error prone and disinterested provider administrator, and are made in a non-transparent and highly complex way), and also unrealistic for a patient to be able to do anything about a denied claim, since there is virtually no competition in the market for health insurance, and because a patient would almost never have the means to sue a health insurance company for damages. All this creates a very poor system that rewards administrators and shareholders at the expense of patients.')
