It affords the ability to use WebAuthn&#x2F;U2F, password managers, as well as an updated browser.<p>However, for this to work, you need to pass an authentication token back to the client - this is done by binding to a port locally, and exposing a webserver which receives an authentication token.<p>Duo Network Gateway[1] authenticates this way, and I&#x27;m sure others do as well. I know Palo Alto GlobalProtect, AWS CLI, and others offer web-based authentication now, but don&#x27;t know specifics of their implementation.
