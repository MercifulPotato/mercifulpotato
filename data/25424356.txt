Many other products have had bewildering UI changes just for the sake of UI changes or have even been completely replaced by other products that look entirely different. Look at the communications products from Google or the music products for recent examples.<p>Worse, all of these products share a cpetent-looking feedback system that is completely ignored. Recently, I&#x27;ve seen humans responding to poor reviews in the Play Store asking for the feedback to be submitted via the in-product feedback, but everybody knows that&#x27;s a black hole. If anybody actually looked at the feedback submitted that way, Google would allocate an engineer to combining feedback from the Play Store into that system instead of responding on the Play Store with pretend interest.')
