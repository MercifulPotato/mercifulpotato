The whole point of hiring an employee is bc $Y represents more net business value than $X. If $X &gt; net business value of $Y, the business shouldn&#x27;t be hiring for that role.<p>Businesses love these H1B visas because overseas candidates are willing to accept less $X since the visa represents significant value to them, but barely costs the business anything (before the recent changes). This results in artificially holding down $X for U.S. citizens, so removing incentives for businesses to take advantage of this is a good thing.')
