Carriers and other license-holders would have to do a token amount of coordination among themselves, probably similar to the settlement-free peering arrangements that the tier 1 Internet networks use.<p>In return, we would all get more efficient real-time spectrum allocation, and the carriers wouldn&#x27;t need to throw away a billion dollars every few years.')
