It should prevent flat-out photocopying and resale of a book, but nothing else.  If you draw your own illustrations for the text of some book -- have at it.  If you invent your own scenarios involving the characters of a book -- have at it.  If you invent new words for an existing song -- have at it.<p>All of these things are under threat and probably completely illegal at this point, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s where society wants to be in another 200 years.  It might be time to rethink what people actually want here, and change the laws.')
