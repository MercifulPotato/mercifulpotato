At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.&quot;<p>Well, why using non-native resolution and cripple your experience? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better to use scaling or just change font size. And one remark, it would be awesome if OS and GUI toolkit manufacturers started to correctly support DPI already, none of my screens is 96 DPI.')
