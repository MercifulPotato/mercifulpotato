Item(by='KaiserPro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611577550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902012, text='&gt; These programs create dependence and never tackle root causes.<p>I don&#x27;t think that argument is entirely valid. I do see the concern. This is about implementation.<p>There are about 60k people who are homeless in LA, of which 48% are sleeping in the streets. so around 29k<p>Compare that to london where something like 10k, but the population is double that of LA. That figure has tripled in ten years, because we have cut back on programmes to treat the causes of homelessness.<p>So it is perfectly possible to tackle homelessness <i>and</i> stop people dying on the streets.<p>In rich countries, especially those with the &quot;all lives matter&quot; mindset, It is reprehensible that we are letting people live in the open on the streets.')
