People type fast and if results don&#x27;t come in within about 100ms or so, the interface doesn&#x27;t feel responsive. We spend a ton of time ensuring our servers are as fast as possible. There&#x27;s always more work to do here, since obviously network latency matters, so where your servers are matters too.<p>Second, the queries themselves are much harder. If someone has typed &quot;India&quot;, did they want the country? Or have they not yet finished typing Indiana? The answer probably depends on their location, which may not always be available. That&#x27;s a simple example, obviously there are much more subtle queries that don&#x27;t always have as clear an answer.<p>Anyways, we enjoy the challenge of autocomplete and hope to continue to do a better and better job, even after Amazon inevitably releases their own :)')
