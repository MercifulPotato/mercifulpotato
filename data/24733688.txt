However, not all federal agencies make their code public.  Some, understandably.  Others, our of budget constraints or ignorance.  In theory, you could file a FOIA request to get the code, assuming it&#x27;s not classified.<p>Other levels of government can be problematic.  In part, because cities and towns can copyright things they create, while the federal government cannot.<p>For example, the City of Chicago and some other cities have data portals open to the public.  Their utility varies.<p>Smaller cities, however, are less likely to understand the important or value of making data public.<p>Back when governments started switching to data processing a lot, I belonged to an organization called Investigative Reporters and Editors.  It had lots of guides for extracting data from local governments.  I remember lots of newspapers rushing out to buy computers are nine-track tape readers so they could sort through the information.')
