Item(by='pluto9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610819777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799997, text='&gt; Outside of a city, good luck getting the police to come to your house. Where I used to live they would take at least 20 minutes and it wasn&#x27;t particularly rural.<p>Even living in the city doesn&#x27;t necessarily help. I once called the police because a guy was in my apartment complex looking for me with a gun. It took them 45 minutes to arrive, and this was in the city only a mile and a half from the nearest police station.<p>It was pretty clear to me after they arrived that since I lived in a bad neighborhood, they didn&#x27;t want to deal with the situation. They figured they could wait, let whatever was going to happen happen, and then roll in and take statements.')
