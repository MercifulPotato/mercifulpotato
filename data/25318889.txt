You can frame it that way, but value need not come into it at all. Business owners are capital owners; they have power which arises from the fact that they own a business. They can offer jobs, which everyone needs, but no individual employee is necessary to them. It&#x27;s a buyer&#x27;s market, and as a result, the business owner has a lot more power to set wages. This leads to the bulk of the money flowing up to the business owner.<p>That&#x27;s how a lot of countries are governed but it doesn&#x27;t actually have to be the case. There are places where there are more businesses than employers which gives more power to employees. A lot of export driven economies are basically based around the principle that workers in those countries are cheaper than any other country. Governments introduce policies that reduce the purchasing power of employees over time.<p>&gt;What we wind up with is a system where business owners have substantially more money than workers, purely as a product of the fact that they can use their power to make this happen.<p>Yeah the real problem is that governments love to listen to what businesses have to say at the expense of workers.')
