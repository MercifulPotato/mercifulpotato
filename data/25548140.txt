Controlling the builder&#x2F;peons units is a chore at best and I would love to see it streamlined a lot. For example just ask for a building to be built instead of finding&#x2F;assigning builders to the task and micromanaging what they will do next.<p>Dungeon Keeper comes to mind as a game that starts to go in that direction but it can be argued it is more a (very) fun management game than an RTS.<p>Probably not doable, we would lose a lot of expressivity in such a change. However, if there is a new RTS coming, I personally would love to see an innovative take on the genre, closer to Brutal Legends 2 &#x2F; Sacrifice 2 (or as another commented posted, something emulating logistics would be another interesting avenue) than to the inevitable Warcraft 4 (for ios ;)).')
