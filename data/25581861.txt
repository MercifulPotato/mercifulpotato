Linux sales on Steam hover in the 1%-2% area of total sales, less than even MacOS.<p>On the plus side, if you use an engine like Unity, making a binary for Linux is no longer much of a problem (you don&#x27;t have to wrangle xplatform libraries etc). On the minus side, actually testing and debugging things to make sure things work for customers who use a variety of distros and hardware is hard, especially since Steam tends to only officially support a single (usually outdated) version of Ubuntu at a time.<p>Larger teams will have the resources for this. But where it really hits hard, is the small indie team made up of Windows devs (as game devs tend to be), when the port is not completely turnkey (like, say, porting a Unity game to MacOS) and requires debugging in a completely foreign environment, when you know you might not get sales to pay for this work, and you&#x27;re already under deadlines to fix a million other things.')
