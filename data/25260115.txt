It doesn&#x27;t seem much more impactful than SSE&#x2F;AVX and friends, i.e. code not specifically optimized for these features won&#x27;t benefit but it&#x27;ll still work and people can incrementally recompile&#x2F;reoptimize for the new features.<p>After all that&#x27;s pretty much how Intel has operated all the way since the 8086.<p>It&#x27;s not like Itanium where everything had to be redone from scratch basically.')
