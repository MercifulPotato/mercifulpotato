When I was graduated 10 years ago, they were using their ip block for their internal network, which can&#x27;t even connect to the internet without a squid proxy. My wife did her master degree there last year and they were still doing it. I can&#x27;t help but think how wasteful it is. Is there any benefit of doing that anyway, except due to legacy baggage?')
