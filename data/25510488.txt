Seems like all the left are is activists now, projecting on the right.  They are totally blind in their hatred, pursing the right like game.  Lots of former liberals moving right because they don&#x27;t agree (which makes them racist bigots that must be destroyed, obviously &#x2F;s)  The left has created a very sad world.  If you are one of them just stop and think for a moment and consider that the right is just  people, and they are not out to get you.  And for the future comments trying to prove this wrong - just do your own research.  Censorship is real and keeping the truth hidden.')
