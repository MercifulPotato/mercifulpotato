Item(by='99_00', descendants=2, kids=[25060557, 25060914], score=6, time=1605113105, title='The internet I knew and love is coming back', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m old. I remember an internet before google, facebook, twitter. It was the wild west. People were free to say whatever they wanted, and even be whoever they wanted.<p>It was decentralized. It was organic. It was sketchy, often wrong, offensive, and beautiful. It was a true marketplace of ideas.<p>And now it&#x27;s coming back. Of course the powers that be are pushing back, with a new arsenal of ammo - doxxing, labeling discussion and opinion as &quot;misinformation&quot;, putting those who express dissenting opinions on blacklists, labeling people extremists.<p>But despite all that, for the first time in the long time I feel good about the internet.<p>Now, I&#x27;m going to shoot myself in the foot with an example of all of the above, including the push back, which you, the audience will provide.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedonald.win&#x2F;p&#x2F;11Q8O2wesk&#x2F;happening-calling-every-pede-to-&#x2F;<p>I am not promoting anything in that link. I haven&#x27;t confirmed or validated any of that information. I am giving it as an example of the spirit of the internet I knew and love. People self organizing on their own platform, acting within the law, on projects that support their values and beliefs.<p>Maybe you have your own examples, from completely different political perspectives. I&#x27;d love to see them too. Maybe I&#x27;ll love it, maybe I&#x27;ll hate it, maybe it&#x27;ll make me angry. All of that is OK.')
