Basically, they make some muscles bigger but not stronger? It sounds like bloat, a mostly cosmetic thing (which has its uses) tbh.<p>The summary results could be clearer in their highlights perhaps; you would think your observation would be a headline and its not mentioned, though perhaps I&#x27;ve missed it.')
