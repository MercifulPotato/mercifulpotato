In particular &#x27;changeme&#x27; has 8 characters and therefore represents exactly 6 bytes.<p>It gets more complicated if you&#x27;re using base64 to represent a number of bytes that isn&#x27;t a multiple of 3, those would be unlikely to happen randomly. Those will usually end in a number of &#x27;=&#x27; signs to pad their length to a multiple of 4 and indicate how many bytes are missing. Although apparently there are also versions o base64 that don&#x27;t include the padding.')
