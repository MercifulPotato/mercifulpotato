This is the part that pushes emotions and inner thoughts, possibly sub conscious thought to the forefront. Bad trips come from this but so do many epiphany(epiphanI?).<p>There may be benifits to both aspects, I feel being able to isolate each part and produce a drug with none of one or even control the levels of both would be a good thing.<p>Think of the recent advancements in Cannabis production which BTW is also a hallucinogen depending on THC levels and strain.')
