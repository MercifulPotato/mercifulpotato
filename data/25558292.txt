No one has:<p>- a widely agreed-upon definition of AAA (budget? team size? total work-hours that went into it?)<p>- an estimate of how much revenue AAA games generate from subscriptions, DLC, and any other add-ons<p>Without both of those, how can you even guess at AAA games&#x27; collective market share? Citation definitely needed.<p>&gt; <i>Custom game engines are already dinosaurs; most of the money in games is elsewhere. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll continue to be produced, just like you can still pay a lot of money for a mainframe today.</i><p>What does raytracing have to do with the popularity of custom engines?<p>Whether I&#x27;m planning to build a custom engine or license an existing engine, aren&#x27;t we discussing whether my job is easier with raytracing than without it?<p>Put another way: it seems like the article is comparing reusable engines without raytracing to reusable engines without raytracing, as well as comparing one-off engines without raytracting to one-off engines with raytracing.<p>I don&#x27;t think being able to use raytracing is going to move any dev team from one option to the other. If they had the desire and resources to build a custom engine, they&#x27;ll probably still do that (against all logic).<p>&gt; <i>Mainframes were never defeated, not exactly - they can still do things that commodity hardware can&#x27;t do. But they just became irrelevant.</i><p>Off topic, but this is not a good analogy. The &quot;cloud&quot; is just a network of mainframes, which means mainframes are arguably the dominant form of computing (and will become more dominant as thin clients, like Stadia, rise in popularity).<p>Mainframes were not necessarily purpose-built, unique machines. They were instead defined by their sharing model, which is where the term &quot;personal computing&quot; comes from -- as a contrast to the mainframe&#x2F;server model.')
