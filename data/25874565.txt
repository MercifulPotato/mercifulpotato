I asked one of the folks on the board if I could put in a charging station on my parking spot, on my own dime.  He laughed and said the HOA wrote him up for running a charging cable out to a battery charger to jump start his car.  He said he highly doubted they&#x27;d be willing to allow folks have chargers installed any time soon.  Bummer.  I like the idea of owning an EV but that will have to wait until I own a SFH years down the line.')
