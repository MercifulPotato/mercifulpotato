Thanks for linking.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m always impressed with the fervour and effort that people put into complaining about Lua 1-based indexing. Folks, using a Meta Table, you can change the indexing to be 0-based. It is such a small thing. Dissing a language full of potential and flexibility because of that is overreacting.<p>Also, those wishing Lua was friendlier environment catering to the needs of young audiences should remember that Lua was not created for that market, but that an environment that does that can be built on top of Lua. You want teach your kid a fun language, teach them a Lisp. It is easy, regular, and fun. Go with Racket. The error messages are good. Or, help someone who is making a Lua-powered game development environment make their app more friendly towards younger audiences. That is not a language&#x27;s fault.<p>The main part of that article is to approach Lua as a toolkit. Do you want zero-based arrays? Do you want errors to be triggered for undeclared variable access? You can built a Lua environment with all of that. Want batteries, you can add them too.<p>For those asking about table copy, lodash, etc. Lua is minimalistic. If you want to add a bit of weight, I recomend using penlight library:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunarmodules.github.io&#x2F;Penlight&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunarmodules.github.io&#x2F;Penlight&#x2F;</a><p>(for example, here is table copy function from penlight: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunarmodules.github.io&#x2F;Penlight&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;pl.tablex.html#Copying" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunarmodules.github.io&#x2F;Penlight&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;pl.tablex....</a>)')
