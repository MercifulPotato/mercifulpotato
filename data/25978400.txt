That&#x27;s different from rendering print content that has no relation to pixels.<p>That&#x27;s one case where the downside is the same, not even worse, and the cases where that&#x27;s not the case are broken. Wayland pushes a lot of things to the client, so it&#x27;s surprising that the client can&#x27;t make this decision when at worst the result has the same problem. And there are a lot of clients that could take advantage of this today. The browsers we are using to have this discussion are made needlessly blurry because of this. They have the whole stack ready for fractional scaling themselves and are forced to 2x and scale down by the compositor.')
