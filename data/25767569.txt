I think it&#x27;s all good in the long run, but I&#x27;m going to sit this one out.<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for my dream machine: something like a hybrid between a microcontroller and a SBC. It should have all the simplicity of programming of an MCU with a lot of the goodies (but not necessarily all) we come to expect from an SBC.<p>I&#x27;d hope to see FreeRTOS run on it. Linux is a nice-to-have, but I view it as to complicated for anyone wanting to really get down to the metal.')
