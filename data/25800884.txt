Item(by='thomas-vds', descendants=None, kids=[25801812, 25800958], score=None, time=1610784800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25800197, text='Thanks for your frank feedback - I do share you POV on the risk of metrics being used for the wrong intentions. Nevertheless I <i>do</i> think that introducing a bug in CI&#x2F;CD tests on master (because e.g. you did push directly on master and not on a feature branch, where introducing bugs is fine) is the kind of behaviour that as a manager you want to see reduced. If such things happen, as a CTO I&#x27;ll anyway ping the dev to let them know they should watch out next time. Delegating this to a simple rules-based engine with rules that everyone agrees on suddenly makes the whole discussion much more objective and avoids human friction. All the while with the more positive cheering which is purely about sharing good stuff.\nWhen it comes to actual monitoring of productivity, the current rules don&#x27;t really allow that, because we all know how hard it is to measure dev productivity (e.g., a single commit of 1 line can add as much value as a big commit of 20 files).')
