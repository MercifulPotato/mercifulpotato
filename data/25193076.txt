And by that, I mean the entire web, the whole shebang, from when I press “Send Newsletter”, to how Normcore makes it way up and through WiFi and then thick cables somewhere in the darkness of the Atlantic, through seas of malware, bypassing the dark web, and finally finds its way to your inbox, all of it. &quot;<p>Well, this implies that dark web and the sea of malware are some dragon land in the middle that needs to be quietly trespassed to reach the other safety.
