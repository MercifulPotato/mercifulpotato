The equations that describe this are linear (ignoring quantum stuff irerelevant at these scales), so the waves combine by simple addition.<p><i>Why can&#x27;t they just coexist?</i><p>In a way, they do continue to coexist (again due to the linearity): For example, if two waves pass each other by, you get back the original waves once you leave the region of interference.<p><i>And if they do add up, doesn&#x27;t that mean that the atoms are piggyback riding on the light wave and essentially slowing it down which shouldn&#x27;t be possible?</i><p>Rather, the electrons around the atoms start wiggling around, making new waves. I wonder if one could set up a mechanical analogue by putting some floating balls in a pool and attaching them to the bottom so that they breach the surface if a wave passes through, creating new waves...')
