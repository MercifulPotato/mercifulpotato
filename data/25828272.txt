Many foster homes are like warehouses with upward of 6-8 children at a time. Fostering children is a paycheck for some foster parents.<p>I&#x27;ve also known a foster child who was placed in a home wherein the foster family had biological children in the house. The biological children were treated better and more lovingly than the foster child. The foster child left an abusive situation, only to find inequitable treatment. The foster child never had anyone model a loving, supportive relationship. So they bounced around from abusive, drug-addicted partner to abusive, drug-addicted partner until they got tired of being around abusive people and drugs.<p>Without a role model, it&#x27;s hard to be equipped once you&#x27;re legally an adult and don&#x27;t have someone making decisions for you. Being an adult is a big responsibility, and a lot of these children weren&#x27;t prepared to make healthy decisions. And they don&#x27;t have health coping mechanisms.')
