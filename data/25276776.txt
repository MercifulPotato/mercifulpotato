At the end of the day, I stay here for less money than I could make somewhere else for two reasons:<p>A) I don&#x27;t like moving; and<p>B) They leave me the fuck alone. They don&#x27;t really know what my office does. They don&#x27;t really know how we do it. But they do know that we provide massive value for the expense. And they let us do it with as little oversight as they can stomach.<p>That&#x27;s worth something.')
