Surely this is wrong. By my limited understaning of the basic structures of functions; when f: R^2 -&gt; R, then f inverse ought to be R -&gt; R^2 right? And when f is just addition there can’t be an inverse solving for both a and b.<p>(If one of a and b were fixed, it’d be way easier, that is, if f(a) = a + b, then g(a) = a - b is an inverse of f)')
