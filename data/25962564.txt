If you’re unlucky you add items to your cart that you would (according to their check out) have to drive 500 km to pick up. Probably a result of the stores themselves being the warehouse.<p>Most stores ship your order within 2 days. With IKEA your’re probably going to wait a week for them to handle the order and hopefully ship it.')
