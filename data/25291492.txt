They were taken to court over it and punished, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t doing it again.<p>Particularly as apparently they&#x27;re still saying what they did wasn&#x27;t wrong in the first place:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;intel-is-still-fighting-a-10-year-old-euro106-billion-antitrust-fine-for-cpu-rebates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;intel-is-still-fighting-a-10-year-ol...</a><p>EDIT: What&#x27;s with the downvotes?  Intel did a pretty despicable thing to AMD; it&#x27;s documented in a court case. And they&#x27;re still fighting to say that what they did was fine.  I think people deserve to know about that kind of behavior, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask if it&#x27;s still going on.')
