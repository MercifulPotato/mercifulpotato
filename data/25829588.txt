It was just kept out of your sight.<p>Some institutionalized patients stabilized not because they had prescriptions or therapy appointments, but because they were coerced to actually take the meds and show up at the therapy appointments. Subject to lights-out at a reasonable hour. Denied access to alcohol and recreational drugs. Etc.<p>Either way, our current understanding is that these were gross violations of medical ethics and human rights. We locked people up who had not been convicted of any crime. We confined people indefinitely who had only been convicted of nuisance crimes. We took people who had the capacity to understand the medical care they were being offered, and we didn&#x27;t care what they had to say about it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how expedient any of this was for society or for the patients, it was <i>wrong</i>. We are as likely to walk this back as we are to re-normalize sexual harassment or slavery or something.')
