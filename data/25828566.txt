For something to be objective, there are clear rules that need to be kept on both sides.<p>&gt; a service for allowing users to discuss kidnapping, rape, and murder openly?<p>I implore you to step out of the political lens for this argument. You don&#x27;t have to search too hard to find such content on twitter and FB as well. The reason they can get away is I guess they can afford to have their own servers.  This kind of environment stifles the new entrants and cannot be good.<p>&gt; Can we operate on AWS&#x2F; Azure&#x2F; Apple&#x27;s App Store&#x2F; etc and meet their terms of service<p>Honestly, I feel that the ground is not stable with these TOS and their changes, and their arbitrary interpretations.<p>--<p>You brought up Apple... so lets look at how it took the app off its store because Parler promoted violent content; it is an admission that it is watching against it. So, tomorrow, if two guys use its own messaging apps to commit a terrorist attack, should&#x27;nt Apple be liable for it?<p>--<p>Let me ask you for a minute to pretend you are right wing,  and you start that recipe making app -- you will not be at peace even though current app is just fine.<p>This unease is what is not good for business confidence.')
