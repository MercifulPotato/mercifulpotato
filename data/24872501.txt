You have to listen to the notes he isn&#x27;t playing.<p>I leave breadcrumbs and openings in my code all the time so that the next time I&#x27;m in there, I&#x27;m set up, invited even, to ask the question I left unanswered before, and maybe do something about it. I leave the option of adding a feature, instead of building a config framework to support it and then defining one implementation. Which will end up not being the correct API when (if) I write the third one.<p>Sometimes people beat me to it, and get excited because they had an idea they&#x27;re now invested in. I usually just let them have it, don&#x27;t point out that I put the idea in their head. It&#x27;s so infrequent people get that invested in functionality, you have to encourage it. There&#x27;s too many things I&#x27;d like to do and never enough time anyway. They&#x27;ve just nominated themselves as a candidate for maintaining that module when I get tired of looking at it, freeing up my time for things nobody else cares about until it&#x27;s done.<p>It&#x27;s like if you were designing a house with plans to expand it later. You&#x27;d be very careful about certain decisions, like whether you should put a bedroom in the logical spot for an addition, because now that bedroom also has to be a thoroughfare. For 20% extra effort, you&#x27;ve extended the calcification threshold for that house&#x2F;code by 80%.')
