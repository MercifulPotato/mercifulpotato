It&#x27;s how far you take that protest that is the problem.  When does a protest become a riot?<p>When you block traffic?  \nWhen you enter a secured space? \nWhen you break into a federal building?\nWhen you set fire to a federal building? \nWhen you set fire to cop cars?\nWhen you break windows of local businesses?\nWhen you loot local businesses?  \nWhen you spray paint hate speech?  \nWhen you threaten cops families with death?  \nWhen you throw fireworks at people?\nWhen you throw Molotov cocktails at people?<p>These all occurred in large numbers during between the death of George Floyd and the Capitol Riot.  How many times did big tech step and and stop the coordinating efforts for those protests&#x2F;riots?')
