It&#x27;s a complete self-contained story.<p>There weren&#x27;t that many multi-season shows that I loved and had a decent ending - usually it gets milked to death that main actors quit and then either show cancelled (Castle) or get a new actor and suck (x-files).<p>Some shows have awful resurrection - 24, I loved the entire thing except for &quot;reboot&quot; and last season.<p>Some shows have honest writers, BSG reboot was clearly getting too convoluted and had to be ended before it cancelled.<p>Some shows try to pivot to tumbler fanfics for content - Supernatural. Which was dumb because people were interested in such stories were already watching it.<p>&gt; If you have a new series, all potential viewers are potential viewers. If you have a season 3, the only potential viewers are season 2 watchers.<p>That doesn&#x27;t always top factor. Some shows can generate money outside of screen - merch. That&#x27;s how supernatural stayed so long.')
