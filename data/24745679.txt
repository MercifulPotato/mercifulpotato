US pumps don&#x27;t appear to be mandated to have such a system, but many still seem to have it. They also often have some kind of plastic or rubber seal behind the tip of the nozzle that prevents gases from escaping the fuel tank - irritatingly, this seal, which I consider a great and practical idea, is almost unheard of at German gas pumps, even though they are mandated by law to perform vapor recovery, and one would think that such a seal would help with that.<p>- The notion of pre-paid gas is almost nonexistent in Germany, and doing pre-paid gas purchases - including doing the dance of having to walk to the shop assistant twice or estimating the remaining space in the tank and only filling it up partially - are a typical &quot;weird thing&quot; German travelers encounter when they do their first US road trip.\nPumps here in Germany usually don&#x27;t even seem to have the capability to slow down fuel pumping when the money runs out, nor can they completely shut off the flow. There are a few modern pumps that can do this, they allow you to pre-select an amount (that you don&#x27;t have to pre-pay, the pre-selection is just a convenience thing for the customer), but most of them can&#x27;t. There are a few automated, unmanned gas stations where you &quot;kind of pre-pay&quot; the fuel by placing a hold on your credit card, then fill up, and finally you complete the purchase at which point the account is charged the amount you purchased. But the size of the hold is usually high enough to cover even the largest cars&#x27; fuel tank to be completely filled, so it is untypical to hit that limit. Because of this, I don&#x27;t even know what happens then with regard of the fuel flow: whether it actually stops (because of the aforementioned technical inability of most of the pumps in Germany to stop at a precisely predeterminable dispensed amount, implementing that might not be so easy) or whether it just lets you run past the limit and sorts out potential fraudsters later (by involving law enforcement and identification of the customer via the credit&#x2F;debit card).<p>- Switching between different kinds of gas (octane differences, or premium fuels) is usually done by taking a different hose from a rack of 4-6 hoses + nozzles attached to the same pump. The US-typical switches you need to press to choose your fuel type are inexistent in Germany. These have also been a major hiccup source for first-time US road trippers in my circle of friends: &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t the gas flow? I&#x27;ve done everything right...ah, I need to choose which gas I want first!&quot;')
