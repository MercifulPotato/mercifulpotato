Even assuming some self-hosted version of an E2EE messaging service exists and I could convince enough of my family&#x2F;friends to use it, I then become &quot;the organization controlling the central infrastructure&quot; who risks &quot;acting poorly&quot; due to incompetence or lack of resources to keep that self hoisted infrastructure running and secured.<p>Signal is not perfect. I don&#x27;t agree with all of Moxie&#x27;s choices (I&#x27;d strongly prefer it not to need to be linked to a real world phone number) and I strongly disagree with some of his choices (I get angry every time a &quot;$name (someone in my contact list) has just joined Signal&quot; notification arrives.<p>But it&#x27;s better than the alternatives for me. And for enough of my friends&#x2F;family that it&#x27;s my most commonly used comms channel outside work.')
