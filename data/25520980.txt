I have two or three accounts specifically for what i want to view. I have an account where I only see video editing tips&#x2F;how-to&#x27;s, and a separate account for real estate, a separate account for personal interests, etc.<p>2. When I invariably see something interesting outside of my normal account&#x27;s spectrum, sure I watch it - but I make sure and delete it from my history.<p>3. I aggressively click &quot;don&#x27;t recommend this again&quot; for anything that falls outside of the account&#x27;s focus.')
