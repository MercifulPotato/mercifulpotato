It denotes, with proof, how accents evolve. The proof is relatively unique for its age. Hence, it is historic, it is history. <i>Relevant</i> history, even, given the uniqueness.<p>For me, personally (YMMV), I am going to link it to my mother (born 1951, my father passed away) who has been to Paris in the 70s with my father, as well as with me about 10 years ago. She&#x27;s also far better in French than I am. I&#x27;m curious on her take. Same with my mother-in-law; she loves the French language.<p>Here&#x27;s another example which shows how society changes. A Trip Down Market Street [1], San Francisco a couple of days or weeks before the 1906 earthquake. You can take from it what you want, what I found interesting I commented on in that item [2].<p>If people upvoted, it was deemed interesting. Regardless, you don&#x27;t have to enjoy it.
