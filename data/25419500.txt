Their entire business is built on stolen content uploaded by anonymous users, and it wasn&#x27;t until they hollowed out the rest of the industry through theft that they started looking beyond it.<p>I would go so far as to say that the reason Pornhub and other tube sites haven&#x27;t taken problems like child porn and revenge porn seriously is because doing so would undermine the foundation of their business: stolen content.<p>On the other hand, this might ultimately work in their favor if it has the effect of raising the bridge they&#x27;ve just crossed. If it gets harder host stolen content, Pornhub has to worry less about someone else doing to them what they&#x27;ve done to others now that they are making a switch to paid content.')
