Only one study has described characteristics and key health outcomes of COVID-19 diagnosed patients in an outpatient setting [3]. This is surprising as primary care physicians often see COVID-19 patients first. They could play a critical role in early diagnosis, treatment, and management of disease progression and virus spread. This assumption is supported by the established principle in medicine that speed of eradication is linked to the outcome of life-threatening infections [4].<p>The early clinical phase of COVID-19 has not been the focus of much research so far, even though timing of antiviral treatment seems to be critical [5]. The optimal window for therapeutic intervention would seem to be before the infection spreads from upper to lower respiratory tract and before severe inflammatory reaction ensues [6]. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 outpatients as early as possible, even based on clinical diagnosis only, may have been an underestimated first step to slow down or even stop the pandemic more effectively. Based on clinical application principles of antiviral therapies, as demonstrated in the case of influenza A [7], antiviral treatments should be used early in the course of infection.&quot;&lt;</i><p>We&#x27;re not as helpless as you believe.<p>Also see<p>&quot;States Bow to Pressure to Reverse Course on HCQ&quot; (Sep. 9 2020) at<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yated.com&#x2F;states-bow-to-pressure-to-reverse-course-on-hcq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yated.com&#x2F;states-bow-to-pressure-to-reverse-course-o...</a><p>and<p>&quot;Is HCQ banned in your state?
