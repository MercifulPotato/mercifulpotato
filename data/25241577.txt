It revolves around trivial cases, for which the government&#x27;s response is <i>proportional</i>. Meanwhile, corporations - particularly Internet ones - are more than happy to escalate minor things into termination of service.<p>To use a concrete example, there was a case recently in which a streamer asked people to vote for things by posting red and green emojis on the livestream chat. YouTube&#x27;s algorithms proceeded to ban people who posted too many emojis. A ban on YouTube means a ban on Google account, which means no more GMail and Google Docs in particular. For an average person - particularly average worker in a small company - this immediately turns one&#x27;s life upside down and is likely to do permanent damage to employability.<p>An equivalent situation with a government would boil down to getting a small fine - nobody is going to terminate your driving license if the police spots you blinking your lights a few times to a friend driving ahead of you.')
