Up to that point, everytime I felt lost about the next step for my company, I found some valuable resources online from smart folks who have been there before. The ones from YC often being the most insightful.<p>Now than we reached PMF, resources are almost non-existent.\nI found two good books (&quot;the great ceo within&quot; and &quot;high growth handbook&quot;), 1 post &quot;after PMF&quot;, and that&#x27;s it.<p>So I am asking if some of you had the same issue, if you known some useful links or if you had to rely on other &quot;resources&quot; like maybe mentors, founder groups, etc. ?')
