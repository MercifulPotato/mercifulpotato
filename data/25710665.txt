This is a site for curious, thoughtful conversation. It is <i>not</i> a site for political battle, snark, or name-calling. Why? Because those things destroy curious, thoughtful conversation.<p>This is one of those moments where we can either raise the bar or slide deeper into the hell realms. We&#x27;re therefore raising the bar. Please use the site as intended: curious, thoughtful conversation, and be kind, regardless of how wrong others are or you feel they are. If you can&#x27;t do that (understandable, given what we&#x27;re all living through), don&#x27;t post until you can.<p>I&#x27;m banning significantly more accounts right now, especially those that have built up a track record of abusing HN. The bans are not based on political position, as anyone with the fortitude to slog through my posting history can see. No matter how right you are or feel you are, make sure you know what the rules are and follow them. In particular, do not use HN primarily for political or ideological battle. Not only is that not what the site is for, it destroys what it is for, so we have no choice but to ban accounts that do itâ€”and so we are: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20banned&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>.')
