Jet is effectively a divergent colormap and allows highlighting of extemes, but none of the other colormaps they consider are useful in this context. Jet isn&#x27;t competing with batlow and viridis, it&#x27;s competing with BwR.<p>Yeah batlow looks better than jet on a photograph, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s necessarily better for communicating data that doesn&#x27;t share the underlying features of photographs. I&#x27;d like to see whether jet or batlow has better accuracy when asking readers to eyeball data values from -1 to 1 based on color.<p>I personally avoid jet etc, but the motivations they give here seem to miss the point of why these colormaps are used.')
