For about four months, there was a huge buzz around the company about how to leverage block chain in health care. The main idea was using block chain to manage patient accounts and PPE.<p>We had all the execs bring in to do huge presentations. They brought in people from IBM to talk about Hyperledger and other block chain companies. They posted videos and articles about how this going to transform healthcare, we were all told this was going to be huge. They told people they were going to form a new team, hire developers and this was a going to be a huge focus in 2020.<p>Six months later? You couldn&#x27;t find a single resource on any of it on any of the internal company sites. All the presentations stopped, the execs stopped talking about block chain seemingly over night and it was like <i>poof!</i> the idea of block chain, or any mention of it or the &quot;revolution&quot; that supposed to follow? Completely disappeared into the abyss, never to be heard from again.<p>I have no idea how much they sank into the notion that block chain <i>could be</i> used for health care, or how many people they hired or the contracts they signed with IBM, but I can only assume they lost a lot of money before they finally realized it wasn&#x27;t going to work out.')
