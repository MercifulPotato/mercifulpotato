Item(by='hyperdimension', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602855103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799342, text='No disrespect to you, but I&#x27;ve heard that &quot;inform you about products you might be interested about&quot; argument so many times it&#x27;s starting to grate on me.<p>Think back to the advertisements (I&#x27;m thinking about the ones in <i>Byte</i> magazine in particular right now [not sure if it was ever distributed internationally, but you can definitely find issues in the Internet Archive.] They showed maybe a picture of a product and <i>paragraphs</i> and <i>paragraphs</i> extolling the product&#x27;s virtues.<p>I despise the modern adtech industry, but I have zero problem with that old type of ad. They helped fund a magazine I liked; I was informed about a product I may not have known existed, and most of all, no one knew if I read the ad or not or how many words of the copy I read, how long I was looking at it, my sentiment while reading the ad... It was a win-win scenario. In fact, every now and then I even like to look at old back issues of those types of magazines, sometimes to just read the ads.<p>That&#x27;s not the type of advertisement I despise now. My main point is that the entire &#x27;Oh, well ads on (e.g.) Facebook, they simply inform you about a new product for sale&#x27; argument people toss around in defence of ads now falls flat to me now. At its core, it&#x27;s essentially a motte-and-bailey argument (if you haven&#x27;t heard of that before, look it up; you&#x27;ll see it <i>everywhere</i>.)<p>The entire ad-tech industry is rife with click fraud, which begets endless and invisible tracking, data brokers, databases everywhere, analytics, ad auctions where they bid upon your eyeballs. That&#x27;s when the media companies, the advertisers, and Google and Facebook frolic about the bailey.<p>As soon as you accuse them of their secretive tracking and data collection, they run right up to the motte and tell you, &quot;Well, hey! We&#x27;re just trying to give you <i>relevant</i> and <i>useful</i> information about products you might not know about!&quot;<p>Well, that sounds reasonable. You acquiesce, and they run back into the bailey and continue to monetize your eyeballs. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what I find most dishonest about modern ads. They claim to be performing a social good, but behind our backs they go back to collecting every piece of our being that they can measure.<p>--<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d never install a Ring device, but I&#x27;d be being way too ideological to not have the empathy to say I wasn&#x27;t glad your car was stolen. That&#x27;s good to hear. :)')
