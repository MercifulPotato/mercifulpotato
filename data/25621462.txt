So it’s not all bad.<p>Edit: also, the print stuff, I feel that’s in line with the Zig Zen - make the language simple to understand. Now the print function has a very clear type. Otherwise you need a “smart” print function (like Rust does with a macro or C does with varargs). Easier to understand, not easier to type.')
