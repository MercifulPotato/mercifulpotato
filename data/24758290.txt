I was able to watch a lot of homes be built using there construction method of pre-built walls&#x2F;floors&#x2F;roof lifted via crane. It does seem like a great idea, speeding up onsite building, and preventing the wood from being left in the elements. These benefits appear to come at a cost.<p>a) The largest benefit seems to come when building a similar building each time, any changes make it hard for the crew to assemble.<p>b) The site has to be cleared of trees and rather open to allow access of the crane.<p>I have since moved to a hot housing market in New England, and see many lots leveled and replaced with new homes. All of them are stick built on site, and this doesn&#x27;t appear to be an issue. The number of days for an experienced crew to stick build a house is short, and many of these homes are very custom. The site&#x2F;house is normally optimized to get the largest sale value, not the easiest built. The other interesting this is it is generally impossible, or not cost effective to use a crane to lift parts on many of these lots. Even if having pre-built sections is a cost savings, it would be such a small difference it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it with the possible risk of quality of the pre-built items and&#x2F;or timing of construction. Home building is a complicated process and many companies seem to be providing solutions without looking at a total solution.')
