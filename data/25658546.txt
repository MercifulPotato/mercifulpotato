Bentley wrote there:<p><i>As soon as we settled on the problem to be solved, I ran to my nearest copy of Knuth&#x27;s _Seminumerical Algorithms_ (having copies of Knuth&#x27;s three volumes both at home and at work has been well worth the investment). Because I had studied the book carefully a decade earlier, I vaguely recalled that it contained several algorithms for problems like this. After spending a few minutes considering several possible designs that we&#x27;ll study shortly, I realized that Algorithm S in Knuth&#x27;s Section 3.4.2 was the ideal solution to my problem.</i><p>Why is vaguely recalling an algorithm studied years prior and needing to look it up indicative of a poor candidate in an interview?')
