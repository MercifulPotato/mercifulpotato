Do you know if there was WLB as one got into a more senior role and climbed the corporate ladder there?<p>This past summer I did some contracting work, putting in 80+ hr work weeks, 7 days&#x2F;week. Management figured I had nothing better to do cause of covid, so they just piled on work. I&#x27;m not complaining about the work, it molded me to be a better employee. I was also fairly compensated for my time. But my health was so bad. Blood pressure sky-rocketed, resting heart rate in the 80&#x27;s as a mid 20&#x27;s male. Eyes red when I woke up every day. Blurry long distance vision.<p>Now that I have balance between work&#x2F;life, I am back to an excellent blood pressure &amp; RHR. Eyes all fine again. I learned an extremely valuable lesson last summer to never forgo life &amp; free-time.<p>edit: I don&#x27;t have a problem working more than a 40 hr work week. In fact, my worldview believes it is necessary to work more than the average person. I found out I can stay healthy and happy by taking Friday nights and Saturdays off. I ideally try to work&#x2F;learn 55-57 hours in a normal week.')
