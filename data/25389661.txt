It&#x27;s so unpleasant to read anything on there that I usually just check notifications and bail as quickly as possible. Also, the ads they show are <i>terrible</i>.<p>The last useful thing I can recall seeing was a day-after-thanksgiving virtual friends meetup invitation. Events are the only reason I haven&#x27;t bailed completely, and it seems the reason that this feature remains sticky is that lots of people don&#x27;t want to bother to maintain email address books anymore.')
