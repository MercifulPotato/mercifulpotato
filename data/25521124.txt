The SpO2 sensor, which never worked on my Fitbit anyways, is particularly helpful to keep an eye on if you have COVID, as it so happens.<p>In my case, I found sometimes I&#x27;d start feeling really odd when I hadn&#x27;t eaten much lately, and I discovered due to my Fitbit that my heart rate was spiking even while I was pretty much sedentary during those times. When my best description of the event prior was &quot;feeling weird&quot;, having that info from my Fitbit is pretty nice if I want to explain to a doctor what&#x27;s going on.<p>Is the sensor extremely precise on those figures? No. Is the general trend of being hooked up to them both during baseline living and during an unexpected medical event pretty useful? Absolutely.')
