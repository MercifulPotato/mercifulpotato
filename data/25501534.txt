It comes from a crisply measurable domain, being length. I can verify if it&#x27;s true or false, to a given level of precision.<p>&quot;John is medium tall height&quot; is <i>not</i> a crisp statement. It represents that John is partly &quot;medium&quot; and partly &quot;tall&quot;, at the same time.')
