However, I think there are cases where Score Voting is hard to implement:\nIf we look at how we rank the countries in the Olympics, we usually look at the medals count. However, a country ranking 4th in every discipline is arguably better than a country ranking 1st in one discipline and last everywhere else. Ranked voting could be used here. It would be difficult to establish the ranking with Score Voting: is being 10% slower in a marathon the same as being 10% shorter in throwing?<p>I don&#x27;t really understand how Range Voting is better than Ranked Voting. Won&#x27;t voters only grade candidates with the maximal or minimal grade to have more impact?\nBut then, Range Voting was supported by very smart people (eg Balinski, Arrow), so I will try to read more about it and hopefully update my website in the future :)')
