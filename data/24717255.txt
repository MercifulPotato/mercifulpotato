As they say &quot;devil is in the details&quot; , there were a bunch of criteria defined for the ban.  Eg material for carrybags, thickness for some items &amp; so on. Immediately, everywhere the polythene bags are replaced by poly-something-else bags . (Polystyrene?) . And the items which were banned based on micron thickness, were replaced by items which are one micron thicker than that limit . The one-time-use factor did not change a bit. Instead of that older material, we&#x27;re now throwing newer &#x2F; different &#x2F; thicker material.<p>It is still plastic, non-biodegradable, single-use, garbage.<p>Sad.<p>Watch out how Canada does.')
