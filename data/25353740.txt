In my experience it&#x27;s not usually very seamless and can sometimes cause issues with detection of the midi keyboard properly.<p>EDIT: I have no idea where you&#x27;re getting that figure but I just looked at three different pairs of Bluetooth headphones that I have in my house, Soundpeats, TOZO, and an LG. None of them have 3.5 mm jacks on them.')
