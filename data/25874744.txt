Anyone who actually needs to open their PC for any purpose whatsoever.<p>I know Apple wants to be the glossy Eve to all the PC market&#x27;s Wall-E&#x27;s, but I will continue to shun them forcefully as long as they remain hell-bent on stifling the nerdy half of all of their users.<p>I assume the developer popularity is a result of the iPhone gold rush, which Apple exploited using exclusivity tactics. Therefore I consider it an abomination to see developers embrace the platform so thoroughly. iPhone development should feel shameful, and when there&#x27;s no way to avoid it, it should be done on a dusty Mac Mini pulled from a cardboard box that was sitting in the closet ;)')
