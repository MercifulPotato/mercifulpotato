It&#x27;s not worth it. At all. Don&#x27;t go down this path. Memory management is easy, but that&#x27;s not the only crap you have to deal with.<p>Templating and the whole C++ ecosystem with Cmake compiling to make is a giant headache. It takes about a week to integrate a new C++ library in source code and people are worried about memory leaks.... while in python I&#x27;ll install an entire library in seconds just to use one function.<p>I would say if you made an app in python and the same exact app in C++, the C++ app would perform waay better. No question. But the developer experience and effort required to make that same app is much much harder.')
