I didn&#x27;t steal it, I was using a work address. I no longer work there nor am I on friendly terms with them anymore so access to the e-mail address is out of the question.<p>The ipad is now blocked. I would love to install linux on it just to get it working, but I can&#x27;t find any way of unbricking it. I also don&#x27;t know what to search for on Google.<p>Do I have any chance with it?')
