Item(by='koolba', descendants=None, kids=[25084193], score=None, time=1605273235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077737, text='&gt; Are you saying that the result of Citizens United is that instead of being a slave to the people or organizations that own the media landscape we are slaves to simply the richest people or organizations. How is that any better?<p>The alternative is that only billionaires that control media empires get to pick what messages you hear.<p>More importantly, the CU ruling was that groups of non-billionaires (ex: a union or PAC) could pool their resources together in order to amplify their combined message.<p>&gt; That is trading one devil for another. I don&#x27;t want a good guy with $1B battling a bad guy with a $1B. That doesn&#x27;t fix anything.<p>It sounds like you just want to silence voices that may be louder than your own.<p>&gt; I want everyone&#x27;s political speech to be on a more even playing field. That currently can&#x27;t happen due to the First Amendment and the interpretation that says money is equal to speech.<p>If I spend my time making and selling widgets but feel strongly about a political issue or candidate, why can I not spend the money I earned (and paid taxes on!) to promote that issue or candidate? Must I purchase a TV network or a newspaper in order to push my agenda? That&#x27;s what CU addresses.')
