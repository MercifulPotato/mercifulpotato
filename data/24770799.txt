Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602626237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770516, text='&gt; There are definitely highly inflated price to rent ratios particularly in land constrained urban areas.<p>The point I was making was that the price of housing on average ($&#x2F;sqft) is the same as it has always been. Since we know major metros have gone up it likely means that tier-2 and below cities have actually gone down.<p>Further, it might be nuanced, but major urban areas aren&#x27;t land-constrained. They are constrained by their city councils staunch refusal to permit new, tall construction to the benefit of existing landowners and at the detriment of renters. This is not an inflation-linked issue however but a city policy issue. It&#x27;s strictly supply and demand.')
