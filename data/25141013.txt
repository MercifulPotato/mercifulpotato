Paying for cheap labor, you get cheap results. I&#x27;ve seen this time and again across many different industries.<p>When it comes to knowledge &#x2F; skill based work, the high end of the spectrum is a multiple of value over the low end. Sometimes that&#x27;s 1.5x, sometimes it&#x27;s 10x, sometimes it&#x27;s 100+x.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many scientists you hired if you didn&#x27;t hire the first one (or one of the first ones) to create a working and marketable COVID vaccine, for example. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many engineers you hired at 50k&#x2F;year if you didn&#x27;t hire the guy for 2 million &#x2F; year that finally got self-driving cars working.<p>At a less extreme scale, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many junior devs you hire to do the work if one senior dev could have done it faster and with less headaches, which happens <i>all the time</i> in tech. On a daily basis, in my experience at multiple tech jobs.<p>And let&#x27;s also remember that market salaries selects for talent before the talent is even there; today&#x27;s smartest students that want a paycheck go for tech careers (and some other fields). If tech stops paying well, those people go into other fields, and you don&#x27;t even get the option to hire that 10xer because they don&#x27;t exist. If you stop paying well but your competitors continue to pay top dollar, your competitors will leave you in the dust.')
