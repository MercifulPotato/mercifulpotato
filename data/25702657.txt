Item(by='Balgair', descendants=None, kids=[25702741], score=None, time=1610215234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700612, text='&quot;God has a special provenance that protects idiots, drunkards, children, and the United States of America&quot;<p>-Otto von Bismark<p>I keep returning to that quote in these days at it&#x27;s so apt even hundreds of years later. The Capitol insurrection could have been <i>sooo</i> much worse. Only a handful of deaths resulted. That&#x27;s incredulous for such an event. That a fire-bug didn&#x27;t get in there and light the whole place up is incredible. That all of Congress was evacuated safely and stayed safe despite seditionists actively trying to lynch them, is amazing in the true sense of the word. The damage to the building itself was minimal, the art and statues are mostly intact, just unbelievable stuff. That despite saying he was going with them, Donny stayed at the WH and just <i>watched the TV</i>. Literally every other autocrat in history would have gone down to the floor of the House and declared themselves King. I cannot think of any other example where the tyrant did not do this (Sulla, but not really even then).<p>The US got so <i>incredibly</i> lucky in this that Bismark&#x27;s quote is the only thing that makes sense to me.')
