It is for many a horrific and crushing burden.<p>It is for many who mismanage it and do not avail themselves of income-based repayment and forbearance.<p>I cannot think of any other kind of debt that allows you to adjust your monthly payments based on your income. That is an extraordinarily gentle treatment of debtors. You can&#x27;t get that from credit cards, home loans, or car loans -- and you can forget about getting any similar treatment from landlords.<p>Student loan debt can be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings if you really can&#x27;t pay. The thing is, most people really can pay, and their loan terms are unusually generous in helping them to be able to pay.')
