Eliminating the following has helped me and family members eliminate migraines:<p>* white flour products.<p>* processed food products with preservatives.<p>* VOCs from furniture, new cars, etc.<p>* any kind of synthetic cleaning products, which basically means dr. bronner&#x27;s soap and nothing else. (If you look at &quot;seventh generation&quot;, &quot;mrs meyers&quot;, &quot;jason&quot;, and other &quot;eco&quot; brands, they&#x27;re all the same crap as dawn and others. They used to be OK in the beginning, but no more.)<p>It is certainly not easy, and basically requires you to become your own EPA and FDA and be vigilant and strict, and may initially cause tensions in your relationships, but I live in multiple domiciles without having one myself, and I&#x27;ve been able to slowly but surely convert them to Dr. B.<p>No brand is forever, and you have to keep watching it and switch to an alternative when it goes bad. For examples of brands who have already gone bad, see above.<p>Every day we play roulette with our bodies, bombarding them with thousands of synthetic chemicals we did not evolve with, meaning they came about in the last hundred years after millions of years of evolving without them. I think migraines are often &quot;last resort&quot; signals which tell us something is seriously wrong, and we need to stop.<p>I think we&#x27;re just beginning to come around to this as a society over the past ~50 years, and it is only getting better, but very slowly. If you want to be ahead of the curve, this is it. I think we&#x27;ll soon look back on this time the same we look back on shoe-fitting X-ray machines from back in the day.')
