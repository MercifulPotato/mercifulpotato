Item(by='refracture', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610902845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809783, text='Doom 3 holds up pretty well actually. People revisiting it via YouTube with the original game often disagree because of an unfortunate bug that causes the image_downsize variables to increment, so despite cranking the settings in the menu the texture settings are at minimum. As far as either the player or viewers is concerned since the setting is at max that&#x27;s just how the game must have looked.. It further contributed to the falsehood that BFG Edition looked &#x27;better&#x27;.  It can be fixed with an autoexec but Dhewm3 fixes it.<p>If you want to scrape back some of that nostalgia you could replay Goldeneye in 1964 GEPD. It boils down to being an emulator that overclocks the emulated hardware to brute force 60 fps.. framerate being the biggest problem with these old N64 shooters. Other things like adjustable field of view, properly hooked and responsive mouse&#x2F;keyboard support make for a slick experience. It trivializes 00 Agent mode but playing in 007 Mode and turning up the enemy AI accuracy and response times can drastically even things out. The emulator can do the same stuff for Perfect Dark too, though that game at least has the remaster on Xbox that is quite solid.')
