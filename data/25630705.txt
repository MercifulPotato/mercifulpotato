(See e.g. the recent threats from China about showing solidarity with the Hong Kong movement even outside of China. See the US covering up war crimes.)<p>What happens if two countries have mutually exclusive laws? (e.g. at least for some time, it was a crime in Turkey to acknowledge the Armenian genocide while in France it was a crime to <i>not</i> acknowledge it)<p>If we don&#x27;t want this to devolve simply to &quot;rule of the strongest&quot;, more detailed rules are needed.')
