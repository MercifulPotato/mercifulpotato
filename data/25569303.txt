We based our Feature Store on a Dataframe API for Python&#x2F;PySpark. The DSL can never evolve at the same rate as libraries in a general-purpose programming language. So, your DSL is great for show-casing a Feature Store, but when you need to compute embeddings or train a GAN or done any type of feature engineering that is not a simple time-window aggregation, you pull out Python (or Scala&#x2F;Java). I am old enough to have seen many DSLs in different domains (GUIs, aspect-oriented programming, feature engineering) have their day in the sun only to be replaced by general-purpose programming languages due to their unmatched utility.')
