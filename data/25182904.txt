Item(by='anonymfus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606097068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179946, text='<i>&gt; I am not suggesting everyone need learn quantum mechanics, but a basic, qualitative understanding of &quot;science&quot; (uncertainty, experimentation, theory) would help understanding and decision making.</i><p>I think that the main problem of the modern education systems is not that people don&#x27;t learn some basic things, but that they forget that knowledge very fast as they don&#x27;t use it after they finish their education, and education itself. So everything abstract and not obviously useful for life or job is under constant threat of removal from the programs by the pressure from adults complaining that kids these days learn too much unnecessary things as these adults forgot what these things were for.<p>As an alternative I imagine a system where education never stops, so for example instead of a person abruptly leaving an education institution and starting a job we would have a gradual change in the number of days in the week dedicated to the education and to the work, with at least one day (I propose Wednesday as a middle of the work week) staying dedicated to the education for the rest of the live.<p>I understand that it all sounds very idealistic and hackernewsish because for the most people the school is a kind of jail that they want to leave as soon as possible, but seems like Scandinavian model sort of solved that. And of course all education must be public and free.')
