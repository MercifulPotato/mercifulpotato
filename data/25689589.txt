The killer for me was that Simple would no longer send out checks through the mail, which was how I had become accustomed to paying my rent.<p>They also pushed for customers to not use personal checks for anything (at one time they didn&#x27;t even offer them), which I now find kind of foolish. So after they ended the check-by-mail service, there was no way for me to get a check to my landlord. And it was just kind of a big middle finger to someone who had been a loyal customer.<p>I guess in the days after the Great Recession we were all hoping for some kind of financial revolution that never came. Simple closing today seems to certify that those hopes are gone.')
