As rivers reach the ocean that process generally produces vast and very shallow silt deposits.    <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Estuary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Estuary</a>  You can even read about what happens in dam removal when that same sediment flows down stream and ends up very near the surface.  There are some very striking images of this processes when muddy flood water reaches the ocean.<p>PS: Also by deep water their talking miles deep.  Dead fish end up falling miles in most of the ocean.')
