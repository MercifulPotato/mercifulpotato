But I&#x27;ve hated most of the other workplaces I&#x27;ve been at. My ideal situation would be to work at NASA, but I&#x27;ve heard some questionable things about that workplace too. Point is, unless you run the show, you have little control over the culture and something will always suck because humans are individuals and not all of us like conforming. So, I just suck it up and work so I can live. Maybe one day I can do my own thing and establish the culture, but I have to be willing to sacrifice and do what it takes to build a successful business. My guess is that if I do that I might just end up becoming the very thing I hate. It&#x27;s easy to be morally superior when I have nothing on the line.')
