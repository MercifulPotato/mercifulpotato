But it does not imply anything sinister despite what you&#x27;re claiming it does in your comments, again you&#x27;re picking a worst case. It&#x27;s like claiming that cars are awful things by claiming that all cars are driven by drunks who end up killing people.<p>If I own an ecommerce marketplace I can look at a customer&#x27;s previous purchases in order to gain some insights on what might interest them. There is absolutely nothing sinister, unethical, or just wrong about this. This is simply using knowledge about someone gained in a relationship in order to improve your service, again not too different from the knowledge you gain about your friends (or anyone you get to know since my use of the term &#x27;friends&#x27; seems to bother you. This is not important to the point), which you use to improve, so to speak, your relationship with them.<p>Of course there is a profit motive, but this is a red herring. A good business profits by actually helping their customers, ie. by providing them with something of value to them.')
