If that&#x27;s the case, then sure, it makes good sense to cancel and either go with another subscription streaming service, or buy&#x2F;rent what you want to watch. There&#x27;s not much Netflix can do about that, short of just spending far more money on licensing content, which would presumably mean raising prices.<p>I&#x27;ve found that disc rental (by post) can be a surprisingly good option, even if it&#x27;s been mostly forgotten with the rise of streaming. The available library is better than any streaming subscription is able to offer.<p>&gt; I generally prefer to watch a movie over a TV series<p>Shouldn&#x27;t this mean you&#x27;re <i>less</i> inconvenienced by content churn? If you&#x27;re part way through a series and it gets removed, that&#x27;s annoying, but this doesn&#x27;t really apply to movies.')
