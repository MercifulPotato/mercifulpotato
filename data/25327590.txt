What does that even mean? One thing I know is that serious thinking involves going through many ideas, many of them at risk of being naive or flawed, to sort out how to think about the world.<p>If an &quot;unserious intellectual&quot; is one that puts substantive ideas out into the aether, however flawed, however self-aggrandizing and, well, human, the messenger might be, then I&#x27;ll take that over whatever you would call this essay. Everybody is wrong about everything, in part.<p>I propose a heuristic: if you&#x27;re reading (or writing) anything whose thesis is &quot;X is a bad person&quot; (or &quot;X is a ____&quot;, for that matter), perhaps you&#x27;re participating in a religious game rather than a thinking game. There&#x27;s no dialectic available after an essay like this, no opportunity for growth. There is just a like or upvote button -- with <i>only</i> the thought that if you press it you might just be on the right side of &#x27;good&#x27;.')
