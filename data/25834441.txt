The first thing I did was search a few of the books on my shelf and see what was similar. Its a really nice way to explore books.<p>Apologies as I don&#x27;t understand the technicalities behind this but I feel this system would apply well to a Spotify &#x2F; YouTube browser. It would help you explore without their algorithms putting you in a filter bubble.<p>Best of luck!')
