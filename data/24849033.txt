Item(by='jcfrei', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603295670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24847350, text='The article mentions that the real focus of anticompetitive behaviour in Google&#x27;s case should be the acquisition or integration of additional aggregators. In this case the Android app store. I think one of the most blatant anticompetitive behaviours is how Google has integrated the play store framework into lots of applications which means disabling it breaks them (or causes apps to show warning notifications). At the same time privacy features for apps themselves keep increasing limiting the possibility for new entrants to collect data on consumer behaviour. This gives Google itself an unfair advantage - which is entirely unrelated to the quality of their service (in this case the play store). This I believe should be the main focus of this DOJ lawsuit.')
