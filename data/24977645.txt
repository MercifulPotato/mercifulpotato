Another rationale could also be when you can give a stake in your company to your family, that way you won&#x27;t ever have need to pay profits during your lifetime, since the company (which could be a charity) will actually work as a cross-generational fund.<p>Also, this works well with the ethos of some companies (like Amazon, allegedly) which reinvest a lot of their profits to cut margins&#x2F;develop new products... And overall just tighten their hold on the market')
