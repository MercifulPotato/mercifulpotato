Because right now AX210 doesn&#x27;t have 6Ghz turned on. And its WiFi Certified document [1] does not have a 6Ghz listed. The WiFi Alliance also does not specifically mention 6Ghz support as being the requirement of WiFi 6E certified. I am under the impression for Intel, a software update will come once 6Ghz has been truly opened up in US. But this will be a first to see product adding new Frequency Spectrum support <i>after</i> its FCC testing and approval.<p>The reason I ask and gone though these trouble is because I saw a few, namely Xiaomi released an WiFi 6E router with no support of 6Ghz.<p>[1] Google: WFA101047 , Its an PDF File with no direct link')
