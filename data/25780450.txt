There are many, many successful production code bases written in dynamic languages. In my own experience as a vision scientist&#x2F;engineer, there is tremendous value in being able to quickly whip up a concept in Python and then being able to easily visualize the results. Doing this exploration in C++ is wasteful. Implementation takes much longer, the correctness brought by static typing is dubious since the code isnâ€™t in prod, and the canned CV&#x2F;visualization libraries are fewer and frequently suck in at least some way. That said, there is also tremendous value in understanding how to map your Python prototype into production code, too. Someone strong in this field can do both.')
