And all that while also leaving mail on the server so that other mail clients such as K-9 mail on my phone (which can do all those things) can also process mail..<p>FWIW aerc does have all this built-in, but also offers the possibility to just hand off responsibility to external programs. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I use the built-in email sender. Unfortunately, the built-in emails fetcher does not work well with poor internet connection or offline. That&#x27;s why I use offlineimap to sync maildirs every 5 mins, and notmuch is just the icing on the cake for fast search&#x2F;indexing.')
