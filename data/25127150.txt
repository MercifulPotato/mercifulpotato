Most modern devices deal with it automatically by checking those plain http urls when the network comes up.  For example, I think the way it works on iOS is that when you connect to a WiFi network the OS tries to hit <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;captive.apple.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;captive.apple.com</a> which triggers the redirect and prompts you for authentication.<p>With https, there&#x27;s no way to have a valid TLS certificate for a random site the user is connecting to (ex: captive.apple.com), so you get a TLS error if you&#x27;re attempting to connect to an https site while the portal is trying to redirect you for authentication.')
