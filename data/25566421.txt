There&#x27;s no consistency, everything changes every 2 years, the documentation is awful when it exists at all, if software is outside your distro&#x27;s package repo it&#x27;s a bitch to install, there are too many different distros, the community is full of pricks, fragmentation is a time-honored pastime, complexity is fetishized... fuck sound still didn&#x27;t work consistently on the last Linux based media center I built. A cursory search of the internet will turn up innumerable reasons Linux Desktop is bad.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that MacOS and Windows aren&#x27;t bad (and getting worse), but they&#x27;re still a damned sight better.')
