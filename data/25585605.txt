If you look at Australia&#x27;s parliament, you&#x27;ll see that even though Labor and Liberal are the biggest party, they &#x27;only&#x27; make up 60% of the seats. That&#x27;s not really good, but it&#x27;s a far cry from Canada&#x27;s 82% (or the US&#x27;s 99%)<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you came to that.  Australia has 151 MPs, 68 in the liberal party, and 61 in labor, or 86% in the two major parties.  Their senate has 76 members, 31 liberal, 26 labor, or exactly 75% in the two major parties.<p>&gt; Do you mean &#x27;against FPTP&#x27;? Because I can assure you that I&#x27;m not pushing for FPTP at all.<p>Yes, I misspoke there, as is clear from the rest of my argument.')
