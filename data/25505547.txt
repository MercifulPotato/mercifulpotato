So excellent that Apple has become the most valuable company of the world. It is the sum of all the products launched and marketed. The Macs had a few bad years, mostly because of the keyboards and the lack of a Mac Pro. They fixed the keyboards and the 16&quot; MB Pro is selling like hotcakes, wait times are often long. And so far their switch to Apple Silicon exceends every expectations. I don&#x27;t think the pro video and audio community is switching because of those wheels, which certainly are overpriced, but because Apple waited too long for a new Mac Pro and the current machine is extremely expensive. This all might change a lot with Apple Silicon though.<p>Edit: after using the touchbar for a while, I love it. For a lot of tasks it is a great addition to their laptops, especially when you don&#x27;t have a mouse around.')
