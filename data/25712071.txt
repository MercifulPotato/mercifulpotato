Item(by='eganist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610264922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711952, text='&gt; The problem here is that private companies are doing something that only democratically legitimized state authorities should be doing, deciding what is allowed or not allowed.<p>So that I understand: on what grounds are such companies deciding what&#x27;s allowed or not allowed <i>for all people?</i> As best as I can tell, they&#x27;re deciding what&#x27;s allowed or not allowed <i>on their own platforms.</i><p>And a point I&#x27;ve made elsewhere but I&#x27;ll repeat here: Parler might&#x27;ve exposed itself to FOSTA&#x2F;SESTA by insisting on not moderating, and as such, while AAPL&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;GOOG deplatformed Parler with violence as cause, it&#x27;s also somewhat likely that gaining awareness of the lack of FOSTA&#x2F;SESTA compliance may have forced their hand. (I&#x27;ll invite an attorney to keep me honest here - I&#x27;m not one.)<p>I keep pointing this out because, of course, FOSTA&#x2F;SESTA were passed in the last few years.')
