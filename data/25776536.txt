Plan out what data should be produced&#x2F;captured by the product<p>2. Instrument systems to actually generate data consistently and effectively<p>3. Build ETL pipelines and data management systems<p>4. Manage enterprise data sharing and resiliency<p>etc...<p>What ends up happening is you have a bunch of Data Scientists just handed a pg_dump or flat file from some ops team. That is typically missing data or poorly formatted and they spend 90% of their time cleaning it up then running some basic regression with numpy or whatever.<p>Need better understanding of the data lifecycle by organizations and investment in instrumentation and data management.')
