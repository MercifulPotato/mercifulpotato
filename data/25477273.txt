Or that they&#x27;re (more) familiar with someone that had generated a large online following.  (I think that&#x27;s why I picked up his book, but had not heard of Marcia Angell.)<p>OTOH I&#x27;m not sure what &#x27;&quot;skeptics&quot; hated&#x27; refers to.  Looking now on Amazon (I am not happy about visiting this site) both are showing 4.6 &#x2F; 5.0 ratings.<p>On Goodreads Bad Pharma is showing 4.1 compared to Truth with 3.95 (but that&#x27;s a pretty tight race).')
