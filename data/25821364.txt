Now, a team of researchers led by the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne is announcing that it has demonstrated what it’s calling &#x27;the world’s fastest and most powerful optical neuromorphic processor for artificial intelligence.&#x27;<p>The processor is capable of achieving 10 trillion operations per second, which the researchers claim is 1,000 times faster than &#x27;any previous processor.&#x27; Specifically, the researchers report, the chip excels at processing ultra-large scale images with remarkable speed, achieving full facial image recognition.&quot;')
