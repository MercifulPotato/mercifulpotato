I realise most people on HackerNews likely disagree with me on these issues. I am not here to convince people of my views on these issues. I respect anyones opinions on these matters.<p>But since you asked, in short:<p>- I really don&#x27;t believe COVID-19 is as dangerous as is projected in the media<p>- I believe the human influence on climate change is much less than what most people tend to believe<p>My views are based on my own research on these issues.<p>If you&#x27;d asked me what issues I&#x27;m worried about, it&#x27;s issues like pollution in the general sense (e.g. like plastics in the sea) or human population growth.')
