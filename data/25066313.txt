That&#x27;s one of the few cases where if the speed drops below 700 or so I get annoyed.<p>As you suggest, 10 Gb&#x2F;s would be fun, but the time saved in practice would be quite minimal. I guess being able to play a game after 2 minutes instead of 6 would be nice.<p>Then again, I remember back in the late 90&#x27;s when I got my first broadband connection. 10 Mb&#x2F;s Ethernet connector installed in the wall of my apartment, I was amazed at the speed. I remember being shocked at how I could download a CD image (a Linux distribution, most likely) in only 20 minutes. It felt like the future had arrived.<p>Now, those speeds would mean several seconds to download a regular web page. I guess once a capability becomes available, you&#x27;ll find a way to make use of it. I suspect that&#x27;s true for 10 Gb&#x2F;s internet as well.')
