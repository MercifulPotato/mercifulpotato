I think there&#x27;s valid reasons why you would want to export your site.<p>I guess the reason we call ourselves a &quot;website builder&quot; is because Makeswift lets you build, well, websites. As for &quot;presentations that can be displayed on the web&quot;, it&#x27;s a bit more powerful than that. All components use to build Makeswift sites are React components and we are planning on opening that up so that third-party developers can create components any Makeswift user could drop in to their website.<p>As for lock-in, again, I think you make a fair point. In the long term we will probably have a self-hosting solution but it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re not focusing on at the moment. Most of our customers just want to focus on designing a website and then clicking a few buttons to have it live.<p>Thanks so much for your feedback :)')
