But media articles are shit, which gets people arguing which is what you want for clicks..... I&#x27;d work towards only DOIs but media science articles to start to get numbers.<p>Just my thoughts. I know I&#x27;d like to see dissenting and agreeing opinions on DOIs, just not sure how you would get there.')
