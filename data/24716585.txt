This could be mediated by culture of income or a hundred other things.<p>They offer no way to evaluate the statistical validity of the conclusions drawn from &quot;BBC Research&quot;. They looked at 1000 politicians, but what was the color breakdown of those? What was the actual sample size of dark-skinned people? Who coded the photos&#x27; skin colors and how? This is just utter garbage without any rigor at all.<p>Their &quot;BBC Research&quot; indicates that male faces read much better than female, but they don&#x27;t comment on this at all. Why did they choose the race angle and not the sex angle?<p>Moreover there are real reasons why dark-skinned features are harder to read than light-skinned. It&#x27;s the same reason things are hard to make out in the dark, or you can&#x27;t tell the features of an object covered in vantablack. It&#x27;s physics. Less light means less information.<p>This whole article is the perfect distillation of low-effort motivated race baiting. To an astute reader it proves the opposite of its bias - if this is what is considered racial greivance worthy of breathless BBC articles, there must really be nothing significant going on to complain about.<p>There is zero chance that anything like this would ever have been published if the results went the other way, no matter to what degree.')
