Your post reminded me about a video by the Youtuber Innuendo Studios titled &quot;I hate Mondays&quot;.<p>(The following is my opinion taken from anecdotes about myself and reading about other philosophical works. I am not an expert on this subject).<p>The idea of &quot;having a soul&quot; is a core belief that is needed to hold up ideas of morals and debt. It&#x27;s an idea perpetuated because people want to be flattered and people in positions of power can use it to influence the masses. As an example, think about when a person refuses to vote &quot;for the lesser of two evils&quot; in the US presidential election. From a utilitarian perspective, voting for the lesser does have benefit: it mitigates damage. But to the voter, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way. &quot;Having a soul&quot; Does provide social value. Not voting for the lesser of two evils preserves ones integrity.<p>Granted I&#x27;m not saying people should transition to Realpolitik.')
