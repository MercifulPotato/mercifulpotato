It makes more sense to say that the child sees the same image multiple times than to say she sees multiple images.<p>So how does the child learn to recognise a fully 3-dimensional real-life horse from a single caricature of a horse seen any number of times? Can you explain?<p>Also, if you were to train a nerual net with a single insance of a caricature of a horse, even if you copied it a million times to create an example set of a million copies, the neural net would still only be able to elarn how to recognise that particular caricature, if that- it would certainly not be able to extract any useful features to recognise real-life horses from that single caricature.')
