Do you have a gas station at home or what? A single charge of an electric car can last you many days in the city. You go to a charging station once a week, have some time for a coffee or some reading, you come back and it is charged.<p>Gas cars have to go to the gas station also, sometimes once a week too, and people do not complain that much about it. I think it has to do with how used we are to it that electric charging we tend to think it should be at home.')
