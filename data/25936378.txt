For example, you can invoke &quot;foo()&quot; on any thing no matter the type, and it&#x27;ll work so long as you have &quot;foo()&quot; declared for the instance.  You can&#x27;t do that in many &quot;OO-heavy&quot; languages like C++ or Java.  The advantage here is that in Python you don&#x27;t have to explicit interfaces and base classes in order to achieve polymorphism.<p>You make a good point though-- the &quot;duck typing&quot; stuff is actually a <i>consequence</i> of Python using objects.  Interesting: the &quot;duck typing&quot; paradigm should be able to be ported to other languages like Java then...')
