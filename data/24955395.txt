As far as I can tell, you mean to dismiss by misdirection or fallacy.  I suggest you&#x27;ve got the wrong end of the stick, and leave it at that.<p>Up until 30 minutes ago, I was an octotree customer.  Do I have standing?  Do I need someone&#x27;s permission to care about this?  I&#x27;m not a concerned contributor; I&#x27;m a former supporter now concerned with what my subscription has enabled.  I cannot address the money that is already under the bridge, but I can certainly stop dropping it in the river.<p>I&#x27;m not upset about the question re: AGPL inclusion, I&#x27;m upset about the very, very poor series of answers and actions by the maintainer, whatever form they&#x27;ve individually taken.<p>Should the whole mess of a posteri license reassignment get addressed cogently and comprehensively, I&#x27;ll reconsider.
