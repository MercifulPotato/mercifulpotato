Someone, let&#x27;s call them Joe, publishes a list of restaurants online with links to their menus and offers to deliver for the price of the order with tip plus a $10 delivery fee. And has a clear disclaimer that they&#x27;re not affiliated with the businesses. That seems pretty unobjectionable. And how would the restaurant even know? [ADDED: Subject of course to any  health regulations that might apply to food delivery.]<p>But that, of course, is not what any of these services do.<p>There is still an argument that some foods just aren&#x27;t a good match for delivery and, disclaimer or not, some consumers will still tend to blame Sally&#x27;s Piping Hot Burgers when their burger arrives soggy and cold (or, worse, because of mishandling someone gets sick) rather than think that maybe they should have just gone and picked it up themselves or just not gotten burger take-out. So Sally should <i>maybe</i> have a right to refuse to sell to anyone other than the end consumer. But that seems trickier.')
