Not for himself, really, but for the general public.<p>As someone actively on the side of trying to figure out how to manufacture cheaper drugs, I have a lot of respect for him for being vocal (if in a self-serving juvenile fashion) about how the patenting and fda orphan drug system is broken and captured by industry.  I can only imagine he was kind of pulling the same trick with the SEC, but miscalculated as he had burned all of his political capital on the pharma shenanigans.')
