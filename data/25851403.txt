There are cases where mutating state is better, and there are others, where it is worse fit. And the latter can just as well be expressed inside a class, like there is no requirement for mutation.<p>I think the two should go hand-in-hand, and for different parts of a program different paradigms can be used? Maybe even add actos-based programming as a possibility, but there is nothing inherently bad with OOP imo, and it is the best way to encapsulate some logic.')
