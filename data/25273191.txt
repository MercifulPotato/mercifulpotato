I&#x27;m still writing all important notes with a pen and paper. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I use apps like Evernote or now Notion for daily use, but at the end most of the information there mostly are not revisited after several weeks. Even I usually forgot where I put my notes there.<p>On the other hands, I write many important notes, business ideas, drawings, or sketches in my paper notebook. I always remember which notebook I put the note about a thing.<p>Also, the paper notebook is great. No need batteries, no hang&#x2F;lag, and no need internet.')
