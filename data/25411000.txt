Brave is a web browser, putting itself between the creator and the consumer is what it does, by definition. It&#x27;s the User Agent. In the case of Brave Today, however, only a preview of the content is shown; when the user clicks, they are directed to the source itself (unlike AMP or some other pervasive middle-man).<p>Serving RSS content doesn&#x27;t require permission; the public feed itself is permission. It&#x27;s created for the purpose of content syndication (it&#x27;s in the name). Brave shows only a preview of content (an image, headline, title, date, and maybe a sentence or two from the feed). For the actual content, the user has to go to the resource itself.<p>As for measuring their Brave user-base, publishers were already in a tough spot. Brave reports itself as &quot;Chrome&quot; to these sites. Ideally, the publisher shouldn&#x27;t need to know if their users are in Chrome or Brave. This feature (Brave Today) doesn&#x27;t change this relationship in any way.<p>Your hypothetical (if Brave starting copying and distributing, verbatim, websites) is definitely terrible. But that isn&#x27;t even remotely close to what&#x27;s happening here; Brave Today shows less content than search results on DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, or beyond.')
