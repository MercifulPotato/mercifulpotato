I bought the recommended tools from iFixit and I&#x27;ve been using them to fix up my wife&#x27;s MBP Mid-2012 Unibody (one of the best laptops to fiddle with in my opinion).<p>Due to all of this I realized that I have just enough knowledge to help others with their computers - or at least I have the right tools. Once I&#x27;m more confident, I&#x27;m planning on starting a Repair Cafe[1] in my city.<p>Repair is daunting for a lot of people - but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. I hope to use the Repair Cafe as a way to improve the longevity of people&#x27;s technology (saving them money) as well as teaching people the skills and knowledge they need to fix things on their own.<p>With even more reliance on technology these days - especially due to COVID - repair is a great way to help struggling families save money.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repaircafe.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repaircafe.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>')
