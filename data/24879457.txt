So maybe some serverless tech can be more specialised and thus better than the Linux kernel at managing, effectively, virtual memory.<p>If everything is written in-house I still think any API would be simpler but I guess this way some functions can be supplied by vendors&#x2F;open-source which currently cannot be composed into an e.g. flask API. So it would be nice to have a way of composing APIs from simple functions supplied in packages for this use. I guess that is what serverless is.')
