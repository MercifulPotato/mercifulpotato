As soon as this information became known - and they would be the first to know about since they would&#x27;ve game planned this out - they would&#x27;ve loaded up on put options and front-run retail investors who were getting stopped out of their position due to cascading liquidations. What a tremendous transfer of wealth from retail to institutions that we witnessed today.<p>It&#x27;s fairly interesting to see the cultural response to this, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to divide down the usual left&#x2F;right political lines which is a relief after years of constant fighting. I wonder if this might be a driver of more political harmony in the coming months.<p>I also wonder how much of all this is due to a social media vacuum created by the end of Trump&#x27;s tenure and his removal from social media. The timing of this GME episode lines up pretty well with that hypothesis.')
