In all of these cases, we had unexplained data or inconsistencies between theories.<p>By contrast, most of the theories that could be tested with a new collider are not solving anything - they are just theories about things that might exist, but could very well not exist at all. There is no hope of gaining insights into the measurement problem or quantum gravity at the next collider.<p>Even the theories of dark matter that could be tested are still too early to be worth a 20b bet. There are too many equally plausible theories of dark matter to say any one of them is promising enough to be worth that amount of money. And even ruling one of them out will not have a major effect on the field. It&#x27;s not like it would rule out string theory, for example.')
