I do not have the luxury of a silent room, or even setting aside quite hours in a day without external distraction. I help dad in his business, so I might be required to help at any moment of the day. Its not that i don&#x27;t want to help, but i cannot stay focused and my productivity takes hit.<p>I don&#x27;t know why i am saying this here. Any hint on how i can stay focused on problem&#x2F;study at hand, like always.')
