The intelligent people know how to link that to other things - temperatures, evolution, whether planets or cities can be sentient, the definition of consciousness. You can talk about things like souls or ghosts too.<p>You can also open up fixed topics that everyone has an opinion about. Politics, religion&#x2F;life, economics, and investing are nice. Everyone intelligent has <i>some</i> kind of investment strategy. A lot of people at least try to figure out religion at some point. A lot of intelligence is understanding that you could be wrong, and dealing with that. If someone straight up says, &quot;Communism bad, end of story,&quot; without trying to understand <i>why</i> communism is bad, they&#x27;re likely not very smart.')
