I think it depends on your goal. If your goal is to just &quot;get on with things&quot; and essential read something more akin to a reference manual or a focused tutorial without any fluff, then yes, Why&#x27;s guide is not appropriate.<p>While I enjoyed Why&#x27;s guide, I found the Little Schemer book to be somewhat impenetrable in contrast. That book has a similar kind of style in the sense that it&#x27;s in a non-traditional format and is widely praised, but I think it occupies the more intellectual &#x2F; academic space than where Why&#x27;s guide is targeted (that is, moreso at the regular Joe Blow programmer rather than someone who who lives and breathes everything CS). K&amp;R seems to reach a good middle ground between practicality and whimsy.')
