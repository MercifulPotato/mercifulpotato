The deleted file has an inode yes but that inode also describes all the blocks that contain the data for that inode and it is no guarantee that the blocks are contiguous. It seems that was completely overlooked, but in this case it turns out everything apart from one part in the middle of the video was recovered leading me to believe that a few of the blocks were in fact fragmented.')
