Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[25877575], score=None, time=1611356617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873696, text='&gt; The important point is not necessarily the mechanism, but rather the intent and a good-faith effective effort to keep things fair and underpinned by public-good policy objectives.<p>Regulatory bureaucracies, especially in the United States because of our political and legal norms, can&#x27;t be expected to police intent and good-faith. Like many other dilemmas you have to squarely answer the question: is this particular policy on the whole preferable despite the negative consequences? In better times a secondary question might be: can we address the negative consequences by <i>directly</i> supplementing functional gaps with a government program? Though, our track record isn&#x27;t that great in that regard, so our decisions, especially at the Federal level, should probably simply turn on the first question alone--taking as a given that the negative consequences won&#x27;t be mitigated.<p>I really don&#x27;t get the opposition to net neutrality. The negative consequences and market impact are minimal, especially considering that it&#x27;s a relatively clear and simple rule; the type of rule that has a long political and legal history of application.<p>And the hypocrisy on the conservative side blows my mind since they began proposing the imposition of user content neutrality on social media platforms. Even if I agreed with that in principle, there&#x27;s no way the benefit exceeds the negative consequences. Net neutrality, which can help foster the emergence of alternative platforms, is an obvious alternative as one of the easiest ways to mitigate the rise of monolithic walled gardens is to ensure cost equity at the infrastructure level.<p>I think repealing Section 230 should be on the table, too. That&#x27;s a more fraught discussion, but abstractly it&#x27;s similar to net neutrality in promoting an arms-length relationship between content creators and network infrastructure providers (to the extent content platforms can be considered infrastructure providers, which is the implicit assumption by those pissed at Twitter and Facebook for censoring &quot;free speech&quot;). I suspect repealing Section 230 would foster the re-emergence of open hosting platforms. Section 230 was never needed to make Usenet, BBSs, or online journalism viable; it was only necessary to make models like Twitter or, especially, Facebook scalable.')
