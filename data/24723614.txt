They sold off their computer business in the early 1990&#x27;s. Analog electronics (On Semi), and then the semiconductor business (Freescale, now NXP).  Finally, they split the government biz (Motorola Solutions) from the phones, and that was first sold to Google, and what remained then went to Lenovo.<p>Motorola was a gigantic powerhouse, and through mismanagement, is a shadow of what it was.  Such a shame.')
