I do not have a lot of savings in order to devote full-time to my project, so I have to get some job on the side, anything really. What are some part-time jobs I can look for and work at until I get this project off the ground? Of course I will quit my full-time so I can get a part-time so that I spend more time on the project<p>Edit: My full-time job sucks hard, its a tech sales job but the company is so bad I will gladly work as an uber driver.')
