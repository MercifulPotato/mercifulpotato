I am averse to upgrading because it&#x27;s working for me and I&#x27;m concerned about 3 rounds of incompatible&#x2F;breaking changes.  I have no idea about the relative maturity of the two versions, how big the breaking changes are or if they&#x27;re likely to affect me, or how much time has transpired between the two versions.  With every &quot;major release&quot; of Chromium my wariness increases, until the only way you&#x27;ll get me to upgrade is when I&#x27;m forced to upgrade my system.<p>How is this communicating clearly or being helpful to me?  Does anyone know offhand what major version of Chromium&#x2F;Firefox they&#x27;re using?  If it&#x27;s just an incremental counter, then why do we need .0.4103.116?')
