However, it was satisfying that my DIY inductor worked as expected, and I was able to determine the unknowns in the recipe with simple algebra.<p>I documented my build story here:\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiernet.net&#x2F;~jff&#x2F;SonOfSVPCL&#x2F;DIYSVTBassPreampInductor.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiernet.net&#x2F;~jff&#x2F;SonOfSVPCL&#x2F;DIYSVTBassPreampI...</a>')
