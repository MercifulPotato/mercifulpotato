We can take the absolutist position that Facebook should never censor - and that may be OK if Facebook actually holds to that positions and trains their audience correctly (&quot;Hey, everything on your feed is unverified and you should never consider anything you read here as having value&quot;).<p>Facebook has a long history of engaging in censorship of some kind though, so that&#x27;s very unlikely as an actual outcome. They could try to form a coherent policy (&quot;We shall censor nudity, things that disagree with US history books and anything that shows violence that isn&#x27;t a cartoon&quot;) but those policies are probably impossible to write.<p>They&#x27;re probably in a ditch they can&#x27;t rescue themselves from so they&#x27;re going to stick to the &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll censor it based on how our censor feels at the moment and their individual preferences, and if we don&#x27;t agree with that later, we&#x27;ll fire them and make up a new policy&quot; which is what they&#x27;ve been doing for a while.<p>I don&#x27;t imagine Facebook would say, allow the Snowden disclosures under pressure from the US, so I don&#x27;t see how they can claim any moral ground on what they would or would not censor.
