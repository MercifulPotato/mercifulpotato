Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[24881103], score=None, time=1603555632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878948, text='One of the reasons that I prefer containers over VMs which rarely gets discussed is that Docker doesn&#x27;t make me configure SSH, process managers, logging, monitoring, etc. Further, as much as I dislike the standard Docker image build tooling, it&#x27;s generally much easier than building and managing VM images. I think AWS Fargate gets it pretty correct by using Firecracker to spin up distinct VMs for every Kubernetes pod or ECS task (basically units of 1+ collocated containers). I would like to see more support for this in Kubernetes offerings for bare metal and other cloud providers.<p>As an aside, there&#x27;s also krustlet--an experimental project that uses Kubernetes to schedule WASM programs (instead of containers) which are less versatile but which are much lighter-weight and more secure than containers. I&#x27;m really excited for WASM orchestrators like this.<p>EDIT: Wow, I really didn&#x27;t expect this to be controversial. I&#x27;m really curious about what people are objecting to with this?')
