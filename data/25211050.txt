Item(by='arp242', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606322259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209805, text='&quot;Experience&quot; is always tricky to define; is a part-time job &quot;experience&quot;? Is spending 20 hours&#x2F;week on free open source stuff &quot;experience&quot;? I definitely spent an insane amount of time programming all sorts of stuff that don&#x27;t count a experience in the classic CV sense, but that I did learn a lot of things from. I&#x27;ve also known people that have been in the same job for years and don&#x27;t seem to learn a thing. So idk.<p>At any rate, I updated it to 15 now; which is job experience + 2 (soon + 1, when it&#x27;s 2021), which seems more than fair. I should probably rewrite this tagline entirely.')
