A couple I know moved to Austin and the guy visited me recently in SF. He was just so happy to be able to eat all the Asian food here. I&#x27;m like him as well: I&#x27;d like a variety of cuisine that is actually simply not available in most places in America. I also want to be close to major airports, live in a highly ethnically diverse place, the ocean, and a general non-authoritarian vibe. If I lived in the Midwest I&#x27;m probably not going to be hyper thrilled.<p>My genuine hope is that people who don&#x27;t want the things I do go to places where they&#x27;re happy. Jobs being located where I want to live actually harms my overall QoL.<p>Anyway, I hope the dot product of feature availability and desire rise for places that are not San Francisco.')
