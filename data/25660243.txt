The way you&#x27;re thinking about accumulating assets makes sense given a child who will need assets and can&#x27;t accumulate them themselves. The way I&#x27;m thinking makes sense given that my 5 kids are all launched and responsible for their own finances. (I invested in all of them--it&#x27;s not like I just kicked them out at 18.)<p>My first reaction to your comment was defensiveness. When you explained how your situation differs from mine I realized you had just over-stated. Happens.<p>I wish you and your child well. A permanently dependent child is a tough position to be in.')
