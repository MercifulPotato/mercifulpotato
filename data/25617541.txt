The problem is that some cloud APIs require a lot of boilerplate params to set up correctly (looking at you, aws_appautoscaling_policy), and HCL’s unit of reuse makes it fairly hard to factor out what our resources have in common and end up with template files clear enough for a reviewer to catch mistakes.')
