Item(by='PJDK', descendants=None, kids=[25136952], score=None, time=1605691484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134425, text='I recently got a Tesla while living in London with no off street parking.  I had the same basic concerns, and only went ahead because I knew I&#x27;d be moving somewhere with off street parking within a few months.<p>But it actually turned out to be a complete non issue.  My usage pattern (short occasional trips around town to shops etc and regular long trips to Bristol and back) could be handled entirely by stopping off for 15 mins at a supercharger when I went passed one.  A bit more frequent than ordinary refuelling but not much more.  It&#x27;s reasonable to assume that 10 years from now fast charging will be at least somewhat more effective and a lot more ubiquitous.<p>I didn&#x27;t have to touch any of the other charging infrastructure in London but there is a lot of it.<p>If we had been staying long term we would have used the 7kw chargers being built into lampposts all over the place[1].  The council will add one in if you have a car and ask for one, but there was already one within my usual parking area.<p>The lamppost thing seems to be London focused for now, but they&#x27;re extremely straightforward installations and news like this is going to see them pop up everywhere.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ubitricity.co.uk&#x2F;residential_charging&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ubitricity.co.uk&#x2F;residential_charging&#x2F;</a>')
