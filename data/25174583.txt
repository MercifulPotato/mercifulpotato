From there, it turns into a dice roll. Gmail is <i>terrible</i> about this; they have a totally opaque and very frustrating engine that sometimes filters messages into a junk folder and sometimes doesn&#x27;t. Outlook.com uses a somewhat more traditional internal RBL, but they are happy to block network segments and they don&#x27;t offer any way to query their blacklist or request removal from it, so you could do everything right but a neighboring VPS or IP will get you blacklisted anyway. Comcast will simply accept delivery of messages and then disappear them depending on an arrangement of the stars that I haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet.
