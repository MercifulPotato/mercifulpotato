There&#x27;s pretty much no documentation, I didn&#x27;t really expect to release it, but it puts a little [t] next to usernames on HN and you can click it to add tags that persist in localstorage and show up next to that user wherever they post on HN. Feel free to use it and adapt it however you like. Only tested on Firefox and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s full of bugs and unintended side effects!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;errantspark&#x2F;7000c8a5192eb0b8ee64ba2128c851c6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;errantspark&#x2F;7000c8a5192eb0b8ee64ba21...</a>')
