Most people have at least some manners even if they are awkward and being in a group face to face adds social pressure to mind them. It&#x27;s fairly rare that you see someone who is a complete boor since they are usually excluded from gatherings due to their behaviour.</i><p>I think in-person power dynamics are often not immediately obvious, and &quot;inclusive&quot; groups sometimes make it worse.<p>For example, cases where the inclusion of someone who&#x27;s socially awkward lead to the self-exclusion of some other people.<p>Someone&#x27;s social awkwardness could lead them to constantly stare at people they find attractive; the leaders or organisers of the group might be too nice to exclude said person, since they didn&#x27;t do anything <i>criminal</i> like harass people, just awkwardly stare at them; and other people might choose to self-exclude themselves because of this.')
