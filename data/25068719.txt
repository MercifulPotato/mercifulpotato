What M1 does well isn&#x27;t that &quot;ARM-is-better&quot; or that they&#x27;re using a smaller process (even if both factors probably plays into helping the M1 chips edge a few %).<p>Rather i suspect that the main benefit that M1 has in many real world benchmarks is that it has on-chip memory, cache-miss latency is a huge cost in the real world (why games has drifted towards DoD internals), so sidestepping that issue to a large extent by integrating memory on-die gives it a great boost.<p>I&#x27;m betting once they&#x27;ve reverse engineered the M1 perf, we will see multi-GB caches on AMD&#x2F;Intel chips within 4 years.')
