(specifically:  606,555 bytes -- just checked).<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastswf.com&#x2F;jDwfXOc" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastswf.com&#x2F;jDwfXOc</a><p>And as it&#x27;s drawn with vector graphics (I guess?) it can be sharper than most of the videos of that that you can find today (or was it fixed? I don&#x27;t remember -- at least it looked so sharp then!). Anyway, the following video on youtube is approximately the content of the 600 KB swf, but, of course, with unchangeable and limited pixel rendering -- and around 50 MB in highest resolution.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LeKX2bNP7QM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LeKX2bNP7QM</a><p>Edit: Just found -- the special edition captured in the above video is ~ 700 KB swf (719,527 bytes):<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpatricka.net&#x2F;assets&#x2F;napsterbad.swf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpatricka.net&#x2F;assets&#x2F;napsterbad.swf</a><p>There, having 100 KB more, one can also click to see the &quot;deleted scene&quot;, play a small &quot;game&quot; or read the hate mail. And it does render across my full screen.<p>Edit 2: Tried ruffle. It can play that swf. Ruffle good. (But it seems that the lines are thicker and that the connections don&#x27;t look the same)<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;WebAnimation&#x2F;NapsterBad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;WebAnimation&#x2F;NapsterB...</a>')
