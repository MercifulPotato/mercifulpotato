A lot of my early tastes came from gems I found in my parents old records.<p>It was also really common to buy an album for one or two songs and then &quot;discover&quot; more songs you liked on the album. The scarcity required you to actually give new songs a chance. I feel like streaming caused my music taste to stagnate because there is no reason not to just skip an unfamiliar song.')
