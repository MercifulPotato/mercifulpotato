The whole time i read it I kept thinking, that this actually sounds like a good tradeoff for the average Robin Hood customer.<p>The way that this is bad is if you are a high frequency trader making micro-trades to capitalize on tiny upticks throughout the day. These rely on frequent 0.5% upticks to make money, so a 0.5% surcharge cancels out its effectiveness. Or someone who is pushing significant capital through the brokerage. If you are pushing $10k - $100k trades then this starts to really significantly hurt you. But then again, Robin Hood isn&#x27;t really meant for you either. Schwabe, TD Ameritrade, Fedelity would work better for you.<p>But for the average Robin Hood investor, most of us are making a handful of trades a month at small volumes (yes, even $1,000 trade is a small volume). Most Robin Hood customers are trading even less. A single share here and there.<p>In the later case, this technique for revenue generation from Robin Hood is actually GOOD for its customers. Instead of paying a flat $7 trade fee that a larger investment firm might charge, you get a &quot;free&quot; trade that technically was marked up 0.5%. So on a $50 share, this means you pay $50.25, essentially a 25Â¢ fee. This is still better for Robin Hoods customers. And Robin Hood making money is actually a good thing for their customers, because it means they can stay around and continue to exist. Robin Hood serves a niche in the trading space that larger firms have no interest in serving. Robin Hood is starting to learn why the larger firms have no interest in this space, but if Robin Hood can figure it out, then it is good for the larger population that can benefit from its service.')
