So you could just as well write<p><pre><code>  function foo(n) {\n    if(n &lt; 10 || n &gt; 100) throw new Error(&quot;Expected n=&quot; + n + &quot; to be between 10 and 100&quot;);\n    return n*2;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd while you are at it you can write an unit test that is tested at compile time or in the editor&#x2F;IDE.<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F; assert(foo(10),20);</code></pre>')
