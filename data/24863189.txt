Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=[24863343], score=None, time=1603400047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24862511, text='The parent example was of &quot;100,000 shares of AMZN... taxed 1,000&quot;, which matches 0.1%.<p>I used that number since that was the number the parent comment saw as being obviously too much already, so I didn&#x27;t need to use a higher number.<p>I do think 0.1% would already be pretty appreciable. That&#x27;s already several 10s of billions a year. The current budget for all of the IRS is on the order of 10s of billions now, so I really doubt adding that new tax would be a net-loss.<p>And, of course, once you have a wealth tax and the sky doesn&#x27;t fall, tweaking the number up over time is easier.')
