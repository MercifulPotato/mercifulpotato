Consider the income distribution according to jobs.  Some jobs are assigned greater monetary rewards than others even if they are essential to the functioning of society.  Much of that comes from our notions of status.  I would argue that distributing wealth according to merit only works as a motivating factor when one is being compared to their occupational peers, which is something rarely seen in lower income occupations.')
