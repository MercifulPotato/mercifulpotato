Interrogate where it comes from and what sort of cultural work it&#x27;s doing. Does &quot;help&quot; mean that it makes you a better worker? Why doesn&#x27;t YouTube help you, and is that a bad thing?<p>Second, the good old days of &quot;before&quot; we were enterprising enough to invent big data etc. is retroactively constituted, and not apparent until its demise. Before YouTube it was television and radio, magazines and books, and even writing itself. On the technology of writing, Plato said &quot;They will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks.&quot;<p>These constructions <i>create</i> the appearance of the industry&#x27;s indestructibility -- certain consequences (the <i>before</i>, the <i>help</i>, or the livelihoods or subcultures you mention) are taken to axiomatic or self-evident, creating a logical construction that is bulletproof in its circular vacuousness. YouTube will die, just as websites before it have died, and technologies before it have died. What comes next might be better or worse.<p>That is to say, just enjoy your videos if they make you happy.')
