We have seen that exact argument hundreds of times.<p>My answer was to the question of how &quot;society&quot; should handle the situation. I fully understand that the companies are free to do what they want. And I believe that as capitalistic entities, they would not have cut off paying customer without pressure from a large segment of society. I just believe that segment was wrong in pressuring the companies to do so.<p>Again, I understand that it is also their (those who wants Parler to have no platform) rights to free speech. I just happen to think that it is the wrong way of approaching this situation.<p>Edit: if it was a single company removing the Parler community (similar to how Reddit was kicking off alot of subreddit a couple of years ago). I think I would be a lot more inclined with your line of reasoning. It&#x27;s the coordinated action from too many sides that made me feel uncomfortable with how this happened.')
