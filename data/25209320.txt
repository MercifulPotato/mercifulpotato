It could decimate most legal jobs if a lawsuit can be converted to mathematical form and then &#x27;executed&#x27; against the laws that are also in mathematical form. You get your judgement and the explanation as to how that conclusion was reached, all automatically.<p>It could even cause headaches if contradictions in legal judgements are detected.<p>It all relies on the conversions to mathematical form being done correctly though which, given that some laws can be intentionally vague, may be impossible.')
