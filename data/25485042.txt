Whilst I&#x27;m a huge fan of the two, my go to is to always start out with a monolith and enforce boundraries within the application that could potentially become microservices at somepoint in the future. Even go as far as to use an in-memory event-driven system in the monolith. Then and only then when the need arises do we pull it out into it&#x27;s own microservice.<p>This has various benefits but the biggest one being you get to play with the design of the &#x27;microservices&#x27; before actually committing to making them microservices allowing you to make better informed decisions. The harder part is that it does require stronger discipline and if not done correctly, a  harder transition to microservices (e.g. pulling out the components)')
