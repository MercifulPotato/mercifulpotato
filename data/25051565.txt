Not particularly coastal aside from the fact that there&#x27;s more urban population on the coasts, as county-level maps show pretty clearly.<p>“Elites” are more dubious. Sure, Democrats and Republicans (counting leaners) are closer to parity for voters with less than a college degree, with college grads and even moreso postgraduate degree holders strongly favoring Democrats.<p>OTOH, Blacks, who are overwhelming <i>not</i> elites, overwhelming are (and even more overwhelming lean) Democratic, and the same is true predominantly (though less overwhelmingly) of Hispanics.<p>So, yes, to the urban part, not particularly independently true of the “elite” or “coastal” part.')
