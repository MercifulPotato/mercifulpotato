I haven&#x27;t seen so much media coverage (good or bad) for a game like this before personally.<p>Is all this bad publicity actually working out for them eventually? I know they are apologizng and everything but at the end of the day it&#x27;s just a business and so is synonymous with sales.. when the dust settles was it a winner or a loser?')
