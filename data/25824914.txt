Item(by='acdha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610994905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824018, text='&gt; How many examples of objectionable content do you think I can find on Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook right now?<p>This is why I suggested reading the filings: Parler is not unique for having user-hosted content but, unlike Twitter and Facebook, refusing to accept responsibility for managing it – those services are far from perfect but they don’t try to pretend volunteer moderation is enough, either.<p>If you read the filing note that the 100 examples were a representative sample and additional examples were provided.<p>The key point to look at is this:<p>“On January 8 and 9, AWS also spoke with Parler executives about its content\nmoderation policies, processes, and tools, and emphasized that Parler’s current approach failed to address Parler’s duty to promptly identify and remove content that threatened or encouraged violence. Id. In response, Parler outlined additional, reactive steps that would rely almost exclusively on ‘volunteers.’”<p>That’s after having months to develop a serious plan, and after an insurrection involving many users of their service. Beyond the obvious violations of their contract, at that point AWS would reasonably worry that not enforcing their ToS could invite legal claims that their continued non-enforcement constituted support. The direct costs of that and indirect risk to other contracts – imagine, for example, Congress prohibiting federal IT procurements from any company connected to the coup attempt — are much greater than Parler’s rounding-error portion of AWS’ customer base.')
