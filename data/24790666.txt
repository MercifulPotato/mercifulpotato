More likely they&#x27;d come based on you going to an event they don&#x27;t like, or having a hobby they don&#x27;t like. And they probably won&#x27;t be interested in any claims that you weren&#x27;t there or didn&#x27;t do that or aren&#x27;t who they&#x27;re looking for.<p>Actual police mostly have better procedures for this sort of thing, but still sometimes get the wrong guy or go to the wrong address.
