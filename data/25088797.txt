I had continual mysterious attacks of joint pain, that I put down to &#x27;overuse&#x27;. In fact it was a decade or two before I could even narrow my diagnosis down to &#x27;gout&#x27;.<p>Like most people, I assumed it was due to rich foods, so tried to identify the culprit. I was unsuccessful. I blamed lots of things, and avoided them. I kept getting gout.<p>Treatment consisted of colchicine for the gout attacks. Very nasty stuff, but it did work and quickly. Allopurinol as a preventative. That worked most of the time but it wasn&#x27;t always successful.<p>By sheer luck, or by lateral thinking, I worked out after about 20 years that gout only happened when I was dehydrated. That was to be expected, I suppose. Uric acid is very insoluble, and when you are dehydrated it will crystallise out in the areas that don&#x27;t have a rapid turnover of fluid, such as the joints.<p>Using that knowledge, I was on the lookout for the first twinges of pain from the gout. When that happened I would quickly drink a litre or two of water and continue to drink water until the twinges subsided. Along with the allopurinol that has stopped the gout attacks cold. I even live in the tropics these days, but I still don&#x27;t get gout any more.<p>IF YOU&#x27;RE A GOUT SUFFERER, REMEMBER TO DRINK MORE WATER DAILY.<p>EDIT: I say &#x27;water&#x27; but, really, <i>any fluid drink</i> will be suitable. You just need to be able to drink lots of it. (Probably even beer.)')
