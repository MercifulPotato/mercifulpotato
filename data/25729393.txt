Iâ€™ve only found these ways of writing software to be universally worse than simple module-oriented programming, writing C-like code in languages like Python or Ruby and only selectively using C extensions for isolated cases where speed provably matters.<p>Compilers do not offer compensating benefits, like catching bugs or ensuring behavioral correctness, that justify all the extra rigidity, slowness, and especially liability of all the extra code (even in Haskell).')
