It&#x27;s not exclusively about threats. This is also a giant billion dollar corporation that deliberately misled customers (who in many cases have already paid them for the product).<p>How did they deliberately mislead them? By saying things like only a natural disaster would stop the latest release date, only for it to slip with less than a month left.<p>That&#x27;s an actual lie and false advertising. As someone with project management experience, the people making those claims are either incompetent or lying.<p>So yeah, customers who paid them money and were lied to have an absolute right to be furious.
