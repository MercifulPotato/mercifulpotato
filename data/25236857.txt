Item(by='username90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606560681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236821, text='&gt; For this question you for example need to know that such cross-region snapshot functionality exists.<p>Do they put services AWS doesn&#x27;t have in the answers? I&#x27;m pretty sure they wouldn&#x27;t since it would make themselves look bad. But yeah if they put in a lot of nonsense answers I agree it works to prove that the guy knows AWS, but I wont believe they do until someone proves otherwise.<p>&gt; Also conditions like &quot;minimal cost&quot; can make an obvious looking answer the wrong one if don&#x27;t know details about the cost of the affected services.<p>Not really, the only time you can make sweeping statements about &quot;minimum cost&quot; is when it is both minimal both in engineering hours and running costs. Therefore the solution with the least number of engineering hours spent will be the right answer.')
