This results from xml entity referencing supporting filesystem access. But there&#x27;s nothing inherently &quot;complex&quot; about that from a language&#x2F;syntax definition perspective, filesystem access is just an inherent danger regardless of complexity.<p>That&#x27;s not to say XML is as simple as it could be (everything has its caveats and edge-cases: null-default attribute namespaces is a weird one that comes to mind), but in general &quot;strict&quot; and limited language syntaxes tend to be much less complex than lax syntaxes: e.g. HTML or YAML, which have endless depths of gotchas with ambiguous or unintuitive parsing behaviours.<p>&gt; <i>that isn&#x27;t very popular</i><p>Ha!')
