I have a friend who recently went through a very friendly divorce. Both parties had agreed on who would get what. In Washington State there&#x27;s a process for these types of amicable divorces where a judge doesn&#x27;t have to make any of these determinations. They had to pay the ~$500 filing fee, wait 90 days and that was it.<p>I&#x27;m sure it varies quite a bit from state to state though.')
