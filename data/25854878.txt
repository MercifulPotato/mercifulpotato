You could do rows with a backpack &#x2F; other household objects or elastic bands with a contraption that anchors behind a door so you can do pull downs.<p>You can try to find a nice fat reinforced pipe in the parking deck near you ;), or get one of those pull up bars that attach above the door frame.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a good workout setup for home with minimal equipment, try the TRX suspension training system. You can anchor it behind a door and do a full body workout using body weight. It fits in a small bag so it&#x27;s mobile and allows you to anchor it at a bar in the nearest park and do outdoor exercises.')
