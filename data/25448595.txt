It has been since WSL 2 was available.<p>As for 16GB of memory, funny enough I just put out a video today around the topic of &quot;is 16GB of RAM enough for web development?&quot; over at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SQS7XCgUPmc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SQS7XCgUPmc</a><p>The video demos running everything I run in my day to day plus more just to see how far 16GB of RAM really goes. It&#x27;s all running on a Windows 10 workstation I put together in 2014 which has a weak CPU and video card from today&#x27;s standards, yet everything runs really smoothly.<p>I never broke 13GB of memory used even with running VMs separate from Docker and heavy duty video editing tools, all while recording a 1080p video at the same time.<p>For folks who want an M1 and are capped at 16gb of memory, I would imagine the memory usage experience would be similar to that Windows based video. Good enough for most web development, even with a moderate amount of media creation and ops work.')
