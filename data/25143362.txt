How Shannon-esque.<p>In my life however, I&#x27;ve often met people who could and did harm others (meaning: me) using verbal communication only. And so, I don&#x27;t share your assumption.<p>I don&#x27;t feel responsible for processing it all. If I&#x27;m suspicious about the intent, I&#x27;ll likely just cut it off and drop it on the floor like it never happened. If I see the intent is improvement and self-improvement, I&#x27;m ~100% invested right there; you can literally put me through hell and I&#x27;ll be grateful.')
