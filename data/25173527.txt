Most kids licked their pencils and started working out the sum the hard way. Gauss immediately intuited that 0 could be paired with 100, 1 could be paired with 99, 2 could be paired with 98... and the total was obvious.<p>That kind of Gauss-level insight doesn&#x27;t seem to be about properties so much as about <i>understanding the relationships</i> that define a domain - and being able to view problems in a kind of conceptual relationship space which can generate insights that massively simplify simple problems, and make harder problems tractable at all.<p>I remember school math was mostly rote learning, but some problems required that creative insight. Academic math seems to lean more heavily on creative insights.<p>Software dev is similar. You can always do things the hard way, but it takes a certain kind of insight to see time-saving shortcuts and simplifications that cut right to the heart of a problem. I suspect some people have a natural talent for that insight, while others are more likely to take the long way to a solution.')
