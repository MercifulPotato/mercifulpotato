It is highly difficult in SQL but it can be also difficult in pandas especially for complex analytical queries. Indeed, in pandas you still have to use the same join and groupby operations as in SQL.<p>An alternative to SQL, join-groupby, and map-reduce is developed in the Prosto library:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prostodata&#x2F;prosto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prostodata&#x2F;prosto</a> Functions matter! No join-groupby, No map-reduce.<p>It is a layer over pandas and its main distinguishing feature is that it relies on <i>functions</i> and <i>function operations</i> for data processing as opposed to using only sets and set operations in SQL and other set-oriented approaches')
