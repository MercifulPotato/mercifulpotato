I disagree.<p>They should be <i>small</i> (or <i>nonexistent</i> in the case of js), but I believe they should be separate, and proper caching enabled. This means that the first page load may be milliseconds to a second longer, but any other page loads after will be instant since those resources will be pulled from cache.<p>Note: I am assuming that the web page under load is really small, 50 kb or less.<p>I welcome anyone who disagrees to say so. I acknowledge that I could still be wrong.<p>Edit: spelling.')
