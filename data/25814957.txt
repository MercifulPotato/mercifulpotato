Even if your vision is 20&#x2F;20, your experience doesn&#x27;t preclude the possibility of someone else discerning Pleione. And if they can, that ability can definitely be determined by time of year; which affects not only where the Pleiades are in the sky (<i>e.g.</i> how much air mass you&#x27;re looking through), but also things like turbulence and humidity.')
