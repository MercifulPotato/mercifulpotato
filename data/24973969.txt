I&#x27;ve found the SDcards in my RPis tend to go south.  It seems to be it would have been so much better to just have one USB 3 slot dedicated for a USB3 Flash thumb drive, which could be slipped inside.    Another small thing: it would be nice if the kbd had a ThinkPad &#x27;stick&#x27; mouse --- which is much more convenient than having to have an external mouse.  But, hey, nobody is stopping &#x27;somebody&#x27; from doing that, eh?')
