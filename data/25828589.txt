However I don&#x27;t actually use it myself because it&#x27;s missing too many essential features and it would take too long to write them.  Also, cross compiling C for multiple platforms is actually tedious due to silly differences between eg. macOS and Linux.<p>The holy grail for me is still the editor from BLS Pascal which was a full screen editor in about 2 KiB of Z80 machine code.  I&#x27;m still not sure how Anders managed so much functionality in so little code, but there&#x27;s just a few little things I wanted differently (which as having Enter split lines and delete joining them).')
