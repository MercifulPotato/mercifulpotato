The sentence quoted in gp is a bit hard to parse, but it is just another way to say unsuccessful research shouldn&#x27;t be hidden and ignored. The context for the sentence is a bit more from the funding side, where I usually only half jokingly say &quot;99% of all funded grants are successful!&quot; Which is the complete opposite of reality, where 99% of experiments fail.')
