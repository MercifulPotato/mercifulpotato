Then when content was added&#x2F;changed, it would be clear which parts of the translations needed updating, and you could either flag them as such for volunteers, or use machine translation as a stop-gap, or both.<p>With the architecture they described, however, your options are either to make the translations completely independent or to make translations completely machine translated, neither of which is a good solution.')
