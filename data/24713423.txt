While that&#x27;s technically true in both cases, it neglects to consider the level of technology that goes into all of the details to make it possible.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that attaching glass to metal is at the same level of complexity as semiconductor fab, but it&#x27;s a far cry from using some Elmer&#x27;s Glue to stick two pieces of construction paper together.<p>And yes, I&#x27;m pretty sure Tesla didn&#x27;t create their own adhesive for the purpose, but I&#x27;m equally sure 3M doesn&#x27;t have an off-the-shelf &quot;Model Y Roof Adhesive, 500ml&quot; product.  Or perhaps they <i>did</i>, but the engineering constraints to develop it were those of normal passenger cars, sunroofs, etc., not taking into account the various forces acting upon a 4&#x27;x7&#x27; sheet of glass at highway speeds, or perhaps the temperatures or speeds of an industrial applicator robot (or conversely, the slowness of a human applicator).<p>To go back to your original assertion, no, it&#x27;s not hard to lay down a bead of adhesive, place the glass in and check that it&#x27;s been done.  If in fact the failure mode was &#x27;Failure to apply adhesive&#x27;, well, that&#x27;s a fairly egregious and easy to spot problem.  If it&#x27;s &#x27;adhesive failed for unknown reasons after a short period of time&#x27;, that&#x27;s an altogether different problem.')
