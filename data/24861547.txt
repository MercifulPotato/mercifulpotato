The Intercept has an article which does a great job of eviscerating it[1]<p>&gt; ...when you take all U.S. taxes into account — federal income taxes, federal payroll taxes, federal corporate taxes, the federal estate tax, federal excise taxes, and the plethora of state and local taxes — the U.S. tax system is just mildly progressive.<p>&gt; If the U.S. tax system were perfectly flat, the share of taxes paid by each group of Americans above would be equal to their share of income.<p>&gt; Instead, the top 1 percent — with an average income of about $2 million — made 20.9 percent of America’s income, but paid 24.1 percent of America’s taxes. Few people will perceive this as a monstrous injustice.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, the middle 20 percent of Americans— with incomes between $41,000 and $66,000 per year — make 10.9 percent of America’s income and pay 9.4 percent of America’s taxes. The bottom 20 percent, making less than $23,000, make just 2.8 percent of America’s income and pay 2 percent of America’s taxes. That is, the “lucky duckies” of the right’s imagination who pay little to nothing in income taxes are still paying a significant portion of their income in taxes overall.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;13&#x2F;tax-day-taxes-statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;13&#x2F;tax-day-taxes-statistics...</a>')
