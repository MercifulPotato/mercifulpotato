So if there was a faded star, it faded prior to 500 BC. (Also, no good candidates for a faded star from modern astronomical studies of the Pleiades.)<p><i>Ancient drawings would help locate the 7th star.</i><p>Rappengl√ºck (1997) suggested that a collection of dots in the Lascaux cave paintings might represent the Pleiades, in part because it&#x27;s located above the shoulder of an aurochs (i.e., like the Pleiades is located relative to the constellation of Taurus). But there are only six dots.')
