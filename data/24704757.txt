I tried to find data from the 50s and 60s, but only found the same report you did.<p>&gt; In other words, what is your model here?<p>American history clearly shows that economic concentration leads to market crashes, recessions&#x2F;depressions, political unrest. For 40 years we put clear rules into place to prevent concentration and keep power broadly distributed - small business owners and farmers has power that could match the financiers and industrialists - and we had no major crashes, no depressions, far fewer lives ruined due to jobs and homes lost. You don&#x27;t need to look at random other countries, just look at what worked in this one.<p>&gt; Why any rational person would want such a situation is beyond me, even if you genuinely see yourself as a Federalist.<p>That 50% is more like 60M adults who vote Republican, and probably some of their children, so more like 20-25%. Most of those people are angry for good reasons, but there is always a chance one of the candidates can really help people like FDR and LBJ did. The whole notion of breaking up big government is an ambiguous, ideological statement that doesn&#x27;t mean anything. You have a choice between private interests (mostly in finance and tech) deciding the rules you get to live by, or you can choose an elected public body. I&#x27;d rather have one hand on the wheel than none.')
