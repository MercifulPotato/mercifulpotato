If they were risk-based, the only people who could qualify for them wouldn&#x27;t need them anyway. 18-year-olds don&#x27;t have credit history, and most of them don&#x27;t have income either.<p>You seem pretty hurt about voluntary loans that have really, really good repayment programs -- better than any other kinds of loans that exist. Why shouldn&#x27;t people be able to borrow to go to college under those terms? Keep in in mind that they have no other options, and they cannot escape into an ideal world where college is free, and they cannot legally force their parents to give them money. For a lot of people, this is a fantastic deal and it&#x27;s the only way they will ever go to college.')
