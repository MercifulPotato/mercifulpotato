In the same way that you could say that an &quot;outcome&quot; (or whatever word is better) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is that employers cannot fire workers for being gay or transgender, even though those intentions weren&#x27;t even on the radar when the law was written. On the third hand, it seems wrong to call Citizens United an &quot;outcome&quot; when it&#x27;s more like a clarification of an existing right, as opposed to the granting of a new one.<p>I also don&#x27;t disagree with the court&#x27;s ruling, I was just trying to phrase my response in as neutral a way as possible.')
