Phoenix has those, just not as many as NYC&#x2F;LA&#x2F;SF.  But one thing computers do exceedingly well is scale.   Dealing with one strange human is very hard for a computer, but dealing with two or more of them is very similar.<p>Snow &#x2F; ice &#x2F; rain on the roads means changing underlying models, behaving more cautiously.    Computers can switch modalities much quicker&#x2F;easier than humans.<p>Fog and other visibility problems are sensor issues.   Humans are stuck with the old Mark 1 eyeball, but self driving cars have a mix of sensors.   These sensors may currently be worse than eyeballs in fog, but may not be in the future.<p>Even given those advantages, you still start in an easy location.   Going from 0 to 1 is really hard, give yourself all the advantages you can.   But going from 1 to N is a lot easier.')
