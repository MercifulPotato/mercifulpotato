Item(by='carapace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606081238, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181111, text='&gt; I remember SF city government going out of their way to try to get actual businesses in there. Clearly Twitter made the egregious error of trying to play ball with the city government.<p>Sure but SF gov and SF culture aren&#x27;t co-extensive.  A lot of us were not happy with what City Hall did to make that deal go through.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not a case of wily city officials tricking Twitter is it?<p>&gt;&gt; Have you asked, &quot;What can do to gain welcome?&quot;<p>&gt; Yes.<p>&gt; The answers ranged from &quot;fuck you&quot; to &quot;sell all your stuff, give all your money to charity, give your job to a QTPOC, and leave&quot;. None of them included kindness, compassion, or being a decent human being. None of them actually allowed for the possibility of welcome.<p>Well,<p>&gt; &quot;fuck you&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s discount that one right off, eh?<p>&gt; &quot;sell all your stuff, give all your money to charity, ...<p>That is actually good advice, or at least similar to what Jesus said.  But a bit extreme if you&#x27;re not feeling it.<p>&gt; &quot;...give your job to a QTPOC, and leave&quot;<p>Hmm, well that&#x27;s back in the &quot;discount right off&quot; bin, eh?<p>&gt; None of them included kindness, compassion, or being a decent human being. None of them actually allowed for the possibility of welcome.<p>Well then, who the hell are these folks?  It may be that you&#x27;re just talking to loud mouths and freaks.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t hang out with them if I can help it. I just meet the ones who lambast millions of dollars to charity as bad (when it&#x27;s people they dislike) and characterize SF&#x27;s xenophobic policies as love. Who obsess over SF&#x27;s supposed weirdness while resenting people who don&#x27;t conform to their expectations. Who make excuses for treating migrants with hostility, and expect them to understand as they refuse to return the favor.<p>Yeah, to me it sounds like you&#x27;ve gotten an earful from some of the louder and less hip freaks.  Ignore them, they&#x27;re loud and ineffectual.<p>I once had a Marxist roommate who tripped a circuit-breaker by trying to move an external electric socket to let a bookshelf be set flush with the wall.  She went at a live circuit with a screwdriver!  This person was over fifty yet didn&#x27;t know enough about home electrical wiring not to stick a screwdriver in a live socket, but somehow felt that she knew how a city or country should be governed!?<p>So yeah, pick your friends wisely, there are a lot of losers here (because this is the town you move to if you can&#x27;t make it in Cleveland or wherever.)<p>Remember that Burning Man started here as a fire-on-the-beach birthday celebration, eh?<p>&gt; The old skool SF types seem to like me. I&#x27;ve got a kind of weird they appreciate. The new skool, on the other hand...<p>So you are sharing and understanding the problem?<p>----<p>&gt; But I&#x27;ll play along. What can I do to gain a welcome?<p>It&#x27;s too late: you&#x27;re already one of us.  Welcome.')
