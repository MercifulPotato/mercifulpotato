Yew frontend and an actix&#x2F;diesel backend. I must say, I actually really liked working with actix. There was a bit of a learning curve, but after I&#x27;d figured out the rust workflow, I felt very productive. Sure, could have gotten up and running faster in Django, but the rust app felt much more solid, like the compiler had my back. If there was something like Phoenix to help with the initial setup as others here have suggested, it would probably be my goto for this sort of thing. Yew on the other hand... it&#x27;s got a ways to go before I would recommend it.')
