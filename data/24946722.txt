Everything is checked many times, at anytime half of the volunteers are for example checking that the other half is doing well. I did that twice and it&#x27;s very very difficult to cheat while it&#x27;s also a simple procedure. The first time, I remember having a lot of people watching me ready to notify any mistake.<p>Then the results and envelopes are collected and transmitted higher up. If you were part of the vote counting process, or a spectator, you know the numbers and you can check that what is reported is correct. It did happen that dead people were caught voting in the past but usually in France it&#x27;s simple and secure enough.<p>Now, try to explain the blockchain to almost everyone.')
