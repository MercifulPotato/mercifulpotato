As long as they enforce those rules evenly, then you know what you’re signing up for when you register an account.<p>I’ve not heard any legitimate, evidence-backed claim that any of the major sites are enforcing their rules unfairly. Instead, the claims are usually along the lines of:<p>“I got banned for saying we should do violent stuff! And yet they allow this other ideologically opposite person to have an account!”<p>“Can you point to a specific post where the other person is saying we should be violent?”<p>“No, but everyone knows they support it!”<p>Well, “everyone knows” isn’t evidence.')
