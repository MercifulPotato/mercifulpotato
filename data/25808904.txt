I will be very disappointed if they add back in USB-A&#x2F;HDMI&#x2F;SD ports, or remove USB-C charging in favor of proprietary charge port. Sounds like unnecessary feature bloat.</i><p>I&#x27;m on the same side, though I wouldn&#x27;t mind one-two USB-A ports added for when I&#x27;m on the go in a hurry without a USB-C&#x2F;A cable. Or the addition of some smart &quot;mag-safe but still usable USB-C port&quot; combo.<p>But given the complaints from the &quot;moar ports&quot; side and the complaints from the &quot;USB-C all the things&quot; side, one thing is clear: There&#x27;s no pleasing some people, there&#x27;s doubly so not pleasing all the people, and Apple has to make its choices and be done with it.<p>That said, while I believed in the initial promise of the touchbar (especially for specialty apps like DAWs, NLEs, etc), I welcome its removal now, and I think most do.<p>The one improvement I could see to make it workable would be a full keyboard with separate, tactile keys (the same as we have now) but with changebale legends&#x2F;colors. That would make learning shortcuts in new apps etc or customizing key behavior very nice. It will also enabled on the fly switch to different keyboard layouts (e.g. from foreign language like AZERTY to Dvorak) complete with key legends.')
