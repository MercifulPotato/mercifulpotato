Well, as a Swede I can tell you that this article is trying too hard about selling the idea that friluftsliv is something unique to the Nordic countries. just like when media tries to sell hygge (coziness) and fika (taking a break) as concepts that are unique, almost impossible to understand by reading alone, to the Nordic countries when in fact they are universal human concepts.<p>An appreciation of and desire to be in nature is part of almost every society on the planet.
