I really do.<p>I&#x27;m not sure my advice is relevant, but I&#x27;ll tell you what I have.<p>I have a <i>gigantic</i> open-source portfolio. I incorporated it into what Stack Overflow calls a &quot;story&quot;[0]. This is sort of a &quot;super-CV.&quot;<p>I have an almost solid green GH Activity Graph[1]. The value of this is reduced by people that &quot;game&quot; theirs.<p>I spruced up my GH profile[2], using their &quot;hidden Profile README&quot;[3].<p>I have had over twenty apps in the iOS App Store, over the years. I&#x27;m down to just a few, now[4].<p>I spent my entire career (over 30 years), <i>shipping</i> product; even my open-source work is done as &quot;ship.&quot; I have written a tool that has become a worldwide standard[5] (but is now under the care of a new team -I hardly have anything to do with it anymore).<p>I write a <i>lot</i> of stuff[6].<p>Basically, my motto is &quot;Don&#x27;t just take my word for it; see for yourself. I can <i>prove</i> what I say.&quot;<p>I would have been happy work for half of what people with far less skill than I demand, as I do what I do for the love of the craft, and my retirement is set.<p>That all means nothing. Recruiters drop me like a live snake, as soon as they figure out that I&#x27;m older than 40 (50, actually). I now make sure that my age is known up front, so that prevents a big waste of time. They don&#x27;t need to give me a binary tree test to weed me out.<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;chrismarshall" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;chrismarshall</a> <i>(Story Format)</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;cv&#x2F;chrismarshall" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;cv&#x2F;chrismarshall</a> <i>(&quot;CV&quot; Format)</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY#github-stuff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY#github-stuff</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile&#x2F;managing-your-profile-readme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;setti...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;AppDocs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;AppDocs&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bmlt.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bmlt.app</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany</a>')
