Sorry!<p>But this is Cornell, which I assume is like other research-oriented US universities. You have a 4 (or maybe 5) year undergraduate, leading to a Bachelors and then apply to graduate programs. The graduate schools may have specific Masters tracks, but not really any general Masters program. Instead, you spend the first year or two taking graduate classes until you either satisfy the assorted requirements or pass an oral qualification (They still have those, right?), after which you focus entirely on research, publications, and your dissertation defense. If you leave school before defending, you get the Masters as a sort of consolation prize---most US PhDs in my experience don&#x27;t have Masters.')
