I had the HN crowd in mind when I mentioned my mates, who definitely DO have other options that would drastically improve their quality of life, but STILL choose to stick with the job that makes them miserable.<p>The jobs I passed on were not bad in any way, but would often require me to sell my soul in one way or another.<p>Besides that, if for some reason all I could do was an &quot;unskilled menial job&quot;, I would still find the one that had at least some element which I could enjoy. I would grow into it and eventually learn to love my job or find another one.<p>This was all in response to the person who made the claim that &quot;you should not love your job&quot;, which I simply don&#x27;t agree with. But in his edit it appears that it&#x27;s mostly an issue of semantics. &quot;Love&quot; has a lot of ambiguous meanings in the English language.')
