Does it work, and does it apply to problems want (or need) to solve matters much more. If it&#x27;s dead, it may not get updates, so evaluate it based on what it is now and what you could conceivably add to it.<p>Learning a new language gives you more ways to understand languages you already know, so it has some value even if you don&#x27;t use it professionally.<p>Unused skills deteriorate, but it&#x27;s often easier to learn things the second time.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t put too many languages on a resume. It&#x27;s always relevant experience, relevant education, relevant knowledge. That means you can omit things if you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re using BrainFuck in production, or you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d apprechiate the classy name. Maybe make a point of putting your favorite esoteric language just in case, but leave the others out.<p>Being able to pick up languages as needed is also a skill. At my last job, I was hired to do PHP work, but I learned Erlang on the job, as well as Applescript (ugh), got a lot less bad at C, wrote some perl and shell, and even had to write some python from time to time. And or course, I had to debug other people&#x27;s Java, but didn&#x27;t write any. I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of positions where they explicitly hire for that, but it&#x27;s sometimes what&#x27;s needed.')
