They&#x27;re barely manageable, even if you know a decent amount about what you&#x27;re doing.<p>No, they are not. It is extreme incoming flow of poorly trained workforce with no relevant experience making it so.<p>You don&#x27;t need to know a lot about networking if you don&#x27;t use microservices, but you just cannot build a decent future proof monolithic system with adequate deploy cadence if you have a team of 50 python devs fresh from coding bootcamp.<p>You can abstract your OS away and actually don&#x27;t need a file system at all if you follow 12-factor methodology.<p>I can rant forever about this, but all this boils down to one thing: fundamental and systematic knowledge of CS and software engineering beats any new fancy tech. While again and again investing one&#x27;s thousands of hours into new languanges and frameworks â€” one is doomed to just repeating one&#x27;s mistakes.')
