Item(by='exged', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606805076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262834, text='EEMBC is a very poor benchmark for anything but very small embedded workloads (the datasets generally fit in a desktop CPU&#x27;s L1 cache), but Micro Magic&#x27;s claims are even more ludicrous. To quote the person in the article (Andy Huang, apparently their advisor):<p>&quot;Using the EEMBC benchmark, we get 55,000 CoreMarks per Watt. The M1 chip is roughly the equivalent of 10,000 CoreMarks in EEMBC terms; divide this by eight cores and 15W per core, and that is less than 100 CoreMarks per Watt.&quot;<p>Almost every claim in this is wrong. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a published score for the M1, but looking at some Intel&#x2F;AMD CPU scores on the EEMBC website [1] suggests a score of 50K points per core for comparable CPUs like the Ryzen 9 3900X. So the M1 is more likely around 200-300K Coremarks, not 10K. The M1 also consumes around 15W for the entire SoC, not 15W per core. The real Coremarks&#x2F;watt of the M1 is probably closer to 20K than 100.<p>Suddenly 55,000 Coremarks per watt for their chip doesn&#x27;t sound so impressive when you realize the M1 also contains a full LPDDR4X memory controller, GPU, neural net accelerator, etc. and has 10x the IPC even on this extremely simple benchmark...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eembc.org&#x2F;coremark&#x2F;scores.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eembc.org&#x2F;coremark&#x2F;scores.php</a>')
