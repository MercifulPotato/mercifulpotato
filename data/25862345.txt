I hope the vaccine makers are looking at adding coverage for these variants to the existing vaccines. That should be relatively easy to do for the mRNA vaccines, but possibly harder for the adenovirus based vaccines like the Oxford&#x2F;AZ and the J&amp;J. The question is whether they would have to go through a full phase 3 trial for this kind of addition or would this be more like how we add coverage to different flu viruses to the annual flu vaccines?')
