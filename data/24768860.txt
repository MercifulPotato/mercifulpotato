Not only does it feel anti-inclusive - it also implies that demographics determine how well people are &quot;served&quot; by a social network&#x27;s designers and operators.<p>If the implication is that &#x27;non white dudes&#x27; would be better served by their own demographic, isn&#x27;t that an implicit argument against a one-size-fits-all digital public space?')
