That seems unfair.’<p>You’re going to need to provide a quote for that.  I don’t see where they did this, in fact I see the opposite.  They <i>criticized the boiling down of demographics and social issues to categories</i>.<p>As to calling it ‘unfair’.  I don’t see what fairness has to do with this.  Adopting a political opponent’s harmful strategies just makes you no different from them.  It doesn’t make the strategy helpful.<p>I really don’t see anything they say that implies that the <i>author</i> sees equivalence between these two acts.<p>What is certainly true is that the two ‘sides’ see their own acts as justified and the other sides as unjustified.<p>I personally agree with you that there is no parity between the two. Trump attempted a coup, whereas BLM staged a protest to get their grievances heard.  You <i>can</i> extrapolate from CHAZ to a desire to undermine our democratic process, but you have to extrapolate a very long way, whereas no extrapolation is needed in the case of the Capitol riots.<p>However I just don’t see where the author is ‘implying’ they are the same.
