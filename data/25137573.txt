If by some chance the book is still not there, you can request that they buy it with little to no fuss (at least in the US). The catalog that your local library has online is more of a starting bid.<p>Additionally, if you have an alma mater, try looking with them. Most universities will give full library  access to alumni if you are part of the alumni association, including journal articles, newpaper subscriptions, magazines, etc. Dues aren&#x27;t too expensive and lifetime membership is reasonable, at least for me.')
