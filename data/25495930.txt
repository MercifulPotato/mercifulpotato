This is in fact how society advances. We do something and make mistakes. We learn from those mistakes and try again. Our current society is a system of rules and conventions built on thousands of years of humans trying things, making mistakes, learning and trying again. Just look how food safety laws have changed over the last 200 years or how labor laws have evolved. The same will happen with Internet companies like Facebook if we are diligent and work to make the system of society better (instead of the current fad of thinking we could ditch society altogether and not end up in disaster).')
