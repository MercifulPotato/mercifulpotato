What I failed to learn:<p>1. What OS is this whole thing running?<p>2. How many drives do I get? What’s the point of ZFS on a single drive? Is this just a way for me to temporarily hold a file system?<p>3. I don’t remember all the flags for the various zfs&#x2F;zpool commands so the example command means little to me. This seems to be the main thing explaining what the service is for, yet I would have to go and look at the man pages to figure out what it does. Best I can tell: I can send my whole filesystem from my local NAS to my drive in the sky, but why would I want to do that?<p>4. Why do I get root access to the box? And if that’s the case, why do I need it?<p>5. What are the details of the data center they are in? Or the location? Or how did they arrive at their 99.999% reliability?')
