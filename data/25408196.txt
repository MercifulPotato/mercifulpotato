I use Visual Studio on C projects at work, and found it very interesting to find that Windbg actually has similar terrible usability as gdb. Gdb and Windbg were both command line interfaces originally, whereas Visual Studio has it&#x27;s own debugger backend which was visual-first (afaik).<p>Really, VS is exceptional even in Windows land. I&#x27;ve tried RemedyDB, an attempted rewrite of debugging on windows, and found it useless. It had similar bugs to this article - no symbols, failure to attach, failed to bind breakpoints at all, failed to display variables.<p>I think it would be a huge project to replace GDB with a graphical-oriented debugger, but it would be worthwhile. If I were in charge, I&#x27;d make it a C lib that didn&#x27;t come with a frontend. That way, the user can stay in their familiar editor and link the lib. (most programs should be able to use C libraries).')
