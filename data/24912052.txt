We find the exact neuron microstructure that is actually a quantum computer and a certain process&#x2F;instruction set can precisely manipulate sensations. We find the exact process that is responsible for the &quot;self&quot; sensation.<p>I know that would still not satisfy my question of &quot;what are sensations?&quot;.<p>&quot;Yeah, this and that neural network, but WHO is actually feeling that sensation?&quot;.<p>It would be a little bit like trying to &quot;see&quot; in 4D space --  impossible actually.<p>2) Why are sensations really needed?<p>If we get to that advanced level as to technically answer the first question, even without a gut feeling understanding, I think we could actually understand the answer to this question.<p>The answer might be -- &quot;because AI can happily process numbers, but the biological quantum neural nets cannot, and they need this &quot;sensation&quot; representation to actually work in the most efficient way possible.<p>By &quot;quantum&quot; I mean some missing stuff we don&#x27;t know yet, I&#x27;m not saying the brain is a &quot;quantum computer&quot;.')
