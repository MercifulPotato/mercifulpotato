So you&#x27;re in the position of maintaining a conspiracy theory without evidence vs. all of the US intelligence agencies.  Moreover, they&#x27;re not making a positive claim, they&#x27;re making a negative one:  that there is no evidence of Russian involvement.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;don&#x27;t trust this until all the facts come out&quot;--that I would agree with--but the Russian conspiracy is a positive claim and those require evidence.<p>I have yet to see anyone present anything other than bare speculation for that, which only proves them correct in their statements.  This is rebuttable:  all you have to do is give some actual, verifiable evidence of Russian involvement.<p>You know, like Hunter&#x27;s signature on the paperwork, or the EXIF data on the photos.  Why do no problems show up under ELA or similar things?  Why does this match what we know from public sources about Bursima paying him a ton of money?  Why can we find his picture on their website in archives?<p>Where is there anything like that for the Russia conspiracy?  The &quot;best&quot; I saw was a bunch of former agents speculating in a Politico story where they admitted therein that they had no evidence whatsoever...')
