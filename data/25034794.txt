What measures can we put into place to allow them to do that if it&#x27;s actually true, or rule it out if it isn&#x27;t?<p>I&#x27;m asking for a good way that someone could <i>find</i> evidence that someone else e.g. mailed in a large number of ballots fraudulently, and you&#x27;re telling me that there is no evidence of that happening. Well yeah, that&#x27;s the issue. What I want is a way to distinguish the case where there isn&#x27;t evidence because it isn&#x27;t happening from the case where there isn&#x27;t evidence because we don&#x27;t have a good system in place for detecting it.<p>I want the ability to show conclusively that this isn&#x27;t happening if it isn&#x27;t happening, not just a lawyer&#x27;s argument that absence of evidence is evidence of absence.')
