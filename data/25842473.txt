A lot of child labor is coming from families without resources &#x2F; reduced education coming from rural to more urban areas.<p>You are pretty clueless about supply chains. A ton of companies pay lip service to supply chain ethics, but do nothing in reality. To actually drop a significant supply chain supplier is pretty major in this space, even if it takes 3 years to spin up a new supplier with capital build out (necessary at Apple&#x27;s scale), QC, integration etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying whataboutism. I am saying this story shows that if you care about ethics, Apple is probably one of the few firms out there willing to make these kind of major decisions.<p>Apparel - it&#x27;s all a lie in terms of the ethics pledges. \nKimberly process for diamonds - badly manipulated - so again a lie in large measure. \nThe list goes on. \nI could go on. There&#x27;s a reason I bought a mad made diamond for my wife.<p>I am saying that you and these other western whiners seem to have no clue about the rest of the world. And if this is the reason you are going to dump apple - I feel bad for you, and everyone who will be abused to give you the cheap crap you end up buying. Because this story is not a bad story for apple in the global supply chain game. And it&#x27;s super frustrating to see these endless stories that have become almost a joke.')
