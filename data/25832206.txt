Mostly by people who also want me to follow them on social media platforms, whose data collection obviously doesn&#x27;t matter, because...<p>But this one really amazes me:<p>&gt; Recently Google changed their policy for storing photos. Starting from July 2021 you won&#x27;t have unlimited High Quality storage as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space but the politics behind it is just disgusting. Google was effectively feeding it&#x27;s photo AI algorithms for face detection and tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it&#x27;s almost impossible to make them better and Google don&#x27;t need users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.<p>This guy is salty that Google doesn&#x27;t provide their platform for free. Aside from that, of course, some ramblings about privacy and stuff. But seriously, complaining for not getting something for free. The entitlement is strong here. I&#x27;d go as far and use the author&#x27;s words here and say it&#x27;s disgusting.  And the privacy arguments are BS, just look at those pretty Google Fonts he uses to tell you how bad Google is.')
