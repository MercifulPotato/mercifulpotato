But the main question should be: why? And the article does not really answer that, well beyond censorship.<p>I think the reason why centralization is a danger to democracy, is because of lobbying. Lobbying is much easier in a centralized power structure. See how much lobbying goes on in and around the power centers of this world: DC, Brussels, London. Lobby is power for money, democracy is power for votes (at least it should be). Currently lobbies have more power in the decision process than voters (any political sciences professor will agree). So democracy is a hollow word, or worse: a facade, a lie.<p>Lobbies basically work in favour of the super rich. If we see the gap widening we see that they get what they pay for, and the for-sure-not-super-rich masses dont get what they vote for.')
