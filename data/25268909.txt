Microsoft really does make its money on products and support. You can see this on their public filings.<p>The relevant dichotomy is more like: people who run Windows aren&#x27;t the <i>buyers</i>. One-off personal licenses for home PCs are more than a rounding error but are certainly not what made Microsoft what it is.<p>Governments and F500 companies buy Windows and Office for X00,000 machines for X0 years of support at a time. Enterprise procurement teams are the actual buyers whose opinions matter to product managers.')
