I&#x27;m working on other problems, and don&#x27;t want to worry about what my browser is doing. I just want it to work.<p>&gt; If you choose &quot;restore previous session&quot; under general preferences, then you can at least not lose the set of open tabs when you restart.<p>Have you ever tried restarting it with 60 tabs open? It doesn&#x27;t work on my machine.<p>&gt; As for 2, Firefox already does this, and has for about 4 years. Since those comments in 2008 and 2015, Firefox has shipped the Electrolysis project, which makes Firefox multi process. The UI (mostly) runs in a different process, which massively improved UI responsiveness, because janky websites can&#x27;t interfere with clicking on stuff in the UI. One web site crashing can still cause another web site to crash, if it happens to be in the same process (out of 8) but we&#x27;re hard at work on the Fission project which will move individual website domains into their own process. Though you can still end up with one instance of Google Docs crashing and taking down another one.<p>I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s multithreaded to separate rendering from management for performance purposes. What I care about is keeping my remaining tabs when one crashes.<p>&gt; we&#x27;re hard at work on the Fission project which will move individual website domains into their own process<p>When this occurs, I will once again consider switching back. Though this means if one API tab breaks, they all do---it&#x27;s still a massive problem.')
