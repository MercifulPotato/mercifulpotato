They usually don&#x27;t get promoted, but they hardly get fired, and if you complain about it, you are taken as the weak&#x2F;prey, not somebody that wants the company culture to not be toxic. It&#x27;s generally a losing game.<p>Some companies put upfront that they want a non-toxic environment and make sure to have a diverse team, that people follow guidelines etc. In an environment like this it&#x27;s possible to remove this kind of toxicity. Otherwise it&#x27;s hopeless. You&#x27;ll look like the crazy person trying to fix a toxic company.')
