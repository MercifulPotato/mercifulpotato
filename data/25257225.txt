The citizens of Oceania may choose to buy into propaganda and nationalism, but they&#x27;re also forced to by an all-powerful police state. The inhabitants of Huxley&#x27;s World State certainly are subject to an oppressive state and brainwashing, but they also do so under far more comfortable circumstances. <i>1984</i> is motivated by pain, <i>Brave New World</i> is motivated by pleasure- I&#x27;d consider the latter to be closer to modern consumerist society.<p>I would assume Gibson simply didn&#x27;t consider the technological ramifications of ubiquitous surveillance, or it&#x27;s just his setup of a decentralized oppressive world of feuding megacorps and criminal super-gangs would have less thematic use for it than <i>1984</i>&#x27;s setup of one (or three) totalitarian governments able to monitor everyone.')
