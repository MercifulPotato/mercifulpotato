Qanon feels like a leaderless cult that is morphing into most extreme (thus most outlandish) claims and believes.<p>But I don&#x27;t think there is any solid core tenet at heat there.<p>Modern religions are always focused at afterlife and the provide you with a way to get there.<p>Qanon is more a way for morons to feel smart. They create a world where they are the smart one and everyone else is a looser. This feels like a coping mechanism to me.<p>Maybe it could grow into a religion or a cult but i don&#x27;t think it is as of now.')
