Zip code thing completely threw me off first time I was renting a car in the US. Drove up to the pump, whipped out my card and... what? Why on earth do they need to know my zip code?<p>Didn&#x27;t know any zip codes offhand so ended up paying inside, which turned out I had to do in advance of course, another aha moment. Inside the cashier naturally asked how many gallons I wanted. I had no idea. Rental car was not one I&#x27;d ever driven before, and I hadn&#x27;t looked in the manual for the size of the tank. I took some comfort that the cashier had no idea either. And so there I was trying to guess how many liters the car&#x27;s tank might be, how much might be left and converting that into gallons.<p>Back outside with a conservative 4 gallons to pump, the guy behind in line kindly informed us of the zip code of the area we were in, for next time. Came in very handy.')
