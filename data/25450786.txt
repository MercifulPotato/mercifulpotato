But that&#x27;s not terribly decisive, it&#x27;d just be nice to see a bipartisan lawsuit for completeness reasons.<p>There are also some aligned reasons; like things like net neutrality are considered Democratic issues.<p>More broadly, the problem is essentially that there is this sort of civil-war-producing toxic polarization at play (and it will be at play until we change the laws to have a party-proportional House; it is caused by an abstract mathematical theorem). That the toxic polarization even exists at the state-executive branch of attorneys general is somewhat remarkable and an indication of how close the US is to something disastrous in the next 50 years or so.')
