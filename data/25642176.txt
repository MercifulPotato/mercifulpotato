However my experience shows that open protocols tend to become entrenched and eventually overwhelm the proprietary solutions.<p>If you look at all the payment networks you mentioned, all of them are regional and not peer-to-peer. Ethereum is wide open and can be used peer to peer. Every country, institution, business, and individual doesn&#x27;t need to trust each other - they just trust the network. And adding new applications to this open network, which is wide open and permissionless, can be done by ramen-powered startups on shoe string budgets. This is why I am so bullish on Ethereum.<p>It&#x27;s open source finance vs. closed source. As you observe regulatory entities, even the USA, bend in various ways to crypto, you can see the foothold it has. And I believe it will continue to grow because novel solutions will sprout up from brand new companies accomplishing things no one thought possible.')
