Does it only go one way (cheaper) or should rich people also pay more? Seems to me that up until now we only had a &quot;Standard Price&quot; for games (USA) and some lower prices, but not any &quot;High Price&quot; for rich consumers (at least not because the country is rich but we do some for other reasons like legislation). If following that thought through the US should clearly have higher prices than a big chunk of Europe. I doubt that will happen though it should.<p>While I do agree with you that it <i>is</i> a problem I don&#x27;t agree it should be changed in itself and I most def. do not agree that it hurts developers (IE. publishers). It is part of the free market and capitalism. Either we have it or we don&#x27;t. If people should pay according to their ability we should not be in a capitalist market where it is more often the direct opposite (money breeds money, lots of money gives good deals, etc.). The problem is part the system but equally that the games industry is extremely greedy. If you can&#x27;t fix the system you have to curb the greed by law. No-one says they <i>have</i> to be allowed to raise the price to 70 euro anywhere. Smells like price cartels to me.')
