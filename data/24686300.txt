That approach doesn’t work so well when the startup shares are illiquid and no market exists to sell them at vesting or tax time. In the USA this isn’t an issue because you can make an 83(b) election with our tax authority which basically means “I elect to pay taxes when I sell, rather than at vesting.” So as your illiquid startup shares vest and you accumulate paper wealth, you pay zero taxes on those vested options unless and until the company goes public, is acquired, pays dividends, etc. If the company goes under, as most startups do, you owe the tax man nothing.<p>To my knowledge no equivalent setup exists under German tax law.')
