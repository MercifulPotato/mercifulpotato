But that&#x27;s not really helpful when assessing the impact of this on a global scale. There&#x27;s some other scenario that&#x27;s the opposite that cancels the benefit out.<p>And as far as heating is concerned, heat pumps are more efficient, and most electricity—when turned into resistive heat—is less efficient than burning the fuel directly.<p>So the only case where it would be a benefit is if your heat is fuel-based, but your power is renewable, and this condition lasts most of the year.')
