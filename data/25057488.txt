If instead it was one person one vote, and representational per state, everyone would have a say. Everyone in Alaska with your views would be heard, as well as everyone in NYC with your views.<p>What you are calling &quot;tyrannical national government&quot; would be majority rule (ie what more people wants, as opposed to now), and is just as true on a state level, just on another scale.<p>Also how the presidential election is structured isn&#x27;t actually related to the question of federal control.
