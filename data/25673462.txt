But when the discussion is about free speech—which this stuff is directly related to, just in a subtle way—then suddenly at least half the comments are clamoring in defense of the large corporations&#x27; right (to censor) to host whatever they want in their platforms.<p>All because &quot;the users don&#x27;t know better, so it&#x27;s good to filter the information they get access to&quot; or because &quot;information overload is somehow more likely to push people to the extremes than siloing and letting people live in filter bubbles&quot; and other similarly paternalistic justifications. It&#x27;s interesting how facebook trying to get the information is bad, but <i>using</i> that information, among other things, to filter what its users see or not is apparently good.')
