Just make sure to keep the tank at least 3&#x2F;4s full; gas pumps tend to go down during blackouts.<p>If you&#x27;re really prepping, also have a fucking bicycle. You provide the fuel and they&#x27;re cheap to maintain.<p>The irony is that the only time it&#x27;s actually safe to ride a bicycle in an average American city is during a post-apocalyptic event when there are no cars on the road =)')
