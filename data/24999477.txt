You don&#x27;t do production at home now, do you?<p>&gt; IPv6 on the LAN is quite a pita due to the massive &quot;random&quot; prefix<p>You probably mean suffix? Anyway, your systems can be configured to either not have that random suffix, and they can also be configured to still reply on their fixed address (the one that&#x27;s not random). Maybe try using the fe80:: address if your prefix does change.')
