I’ve only seen SDI available on expensive camera gear (but I don’t look that hard), but HDMI is <i>ubiquitous</i>. It’s sad DisplayPort didn’t end up winning instead, but I guess TV manufacturers are members, so they’d put it in the TVs. DisplayPort still has a stupid “membership fee” but at least it’s royalty free.')
