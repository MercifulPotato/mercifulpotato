Even if it doesn&#x27;t make me &quot;valuable&quot; in the job market. I should perhaps do what everyone else does: investing, learning front end and APIs (or whatever is required in the market RN).\nBut your last sentence also resonated with me:<p>&quot;The actual way to prepare would be as always: maximize your salary and save as much as possible.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s for having a &quot;psychological leverage&#x2F;advantage&quot; I guess. If you are not having money issues you will likely get rid of the &quot;draining background processes&quot; in your head and focus on more productive things.\nSo in other words FU money is always good. :)')
