No I don&#x27;t have that much money :)<p>I&#x27;d love for my tax dollars to go to help people be better off financially because that is good for society&#x2F;country&#x2F;economy. I&#x27;d love for my tax dollars to go toward the IRS as they are super understaffed. I&#x27;d love for my tax dollars to go toward subsidizing college and getting costs lower. I&#x27;d love for my tax dollars to go toward helping people who are unemployed.<p>Do you get mad that you pay into car insurance and never crash?<p>Gov = insurance, just because you don&#x27;t use every program isn&#x27;t a bad thing. If your kid needs it one day it will be for them.<p>I just don&#x27;t get this super selfish thing. I want a stronger culture&#x2F;society&#x2F;economy&#x2F;country.')
