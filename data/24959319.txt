My experience has been that you can absolutely get decent speedups of 10-20% or more with a few well-placed conditional moves. The cases where this matters are rare, but they do occur in some real-world software, where sticking a conditional move in some very hot place will have such an impact on the entire application. Conversely, you can get slowdowns of the same magnitude with <i>badly</i> placed conditional moves.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult trade-off, since most branches are fairly predictable, and good branch prediction and speculative execution can very often beat a conditional move.')
