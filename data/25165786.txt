The main reason being is that podman-in-podman doesn&#x27;t work and had bugs (at least back in Nov 2019). Maybe it fixed now but this was our experience. We ended up doing quite a bit of analysis on podman only to conclude it&#x27;s simply <i>not there yet</i> relative to docker (ecosystem and ergonomics).<p>There are quite a few corner cases that docker quite simply supports out of the box beautifully that podman doesn&#x27;t support or just has bugs.<p>I like the what the project is trying to solve by being daemonless, but this is not as simple as a drop in replacement for docker that RedHat markets it as (<i>alias docker=podman</i>).<p>We ended up sticking to docker professionally and personally, I am still using docker over podman. The ecosystem and ergonomics are just far too nice to give up over podman.')
