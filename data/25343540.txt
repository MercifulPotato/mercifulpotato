When I started everything was great, it was structured in such a way that as a student you met in groups to discuss lectures and you could easily focus on only your code while someone else who was ahead in the program could apply for a small leadership role and get paid for a part-time gig leading these groups. Time has moved on... these roles seem to have fallen by the wayside to pave the way for having students become teachers for other students under the guise of &#x27;learning leadership&#x27; . It happened gradually as the first few cycles of this were something you could opt in or out of but now have been fully integrated and mandated. The coding bootcamp has now become more of a coding&#x2F;middle-management bootcamp. Not what more than a few students I&#x27;ve spoken with could be called happy about paying for - but most of our e-mails come back with disappointment as we have no options to say nah, this isn&#x27;t what I signed on for.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LambdaSchool&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k8e5uc&#x2F;lambda_leadership_program&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LambdaSchool&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k8e5uc&#x2F;lambda...</a><p>&gt; Please don’t go to Lambda, take my warning from a former student you’ll be better off doing free online coding courses or anything else, just please avoid lambda at all costs<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LambdaSchool&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jxdli3&#x2F;please_dont_go_to_lambda_take_my_warning_from_a&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LambdaSchool&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jxdli3&#x2F;please...</a>')
