If you move 150W of heat using only 100W of electricity, you have 150% &quot;efficiency&quot;.<p>---------<p>I don&#x27;t know the term for the other kind of efficiency (I&#x27;m not a physicist), but lets call it &quot;inverse engine efficiency&quot;. This is &quot;energy out &#x2F; energy in&quot;, which ends up being pretty close to &quot;energy moved &#x2F; (energy moved+electricity used)&quot;<p>Under this measurement of efficiency, 150W moved with 100W of electricity is 60% efficient. This follows the more standard physics rule of thermodynamics (you can never go above 100% efficiency: it will always take some number of energy to move heat around).<p>Note: Car air-conditioners are funny systems. They use the heat from the combustion engine to move heat from inside the cabin to the outside world. So you are literally using heat to move other heat.')
