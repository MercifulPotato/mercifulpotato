In the beginning a normal walking speed would get my heart rate up, but after a while I couldn’t get my heart rate above the 90s no matter how fast I walked. So my solution was to first add a 36lb belt, which does not put weight on your back or hold in heat. Eventually I had to add a 45lb weighted vest and sometimes 20lb ankle weights on top. Even with all that it takes much less of a toll and is much easier to recover from than running. And I can still get my heart rate up to the 140s without having to run.')
