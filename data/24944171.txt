Yet, the conversation here is the NYT.<p>That is because practically everyone on HN agrees Fox is bad, biased, etc. Therefore the debate is going to be implicitly about how bad the NYT is in relation to Fox.<p>A related factor is that it&#x27;s hard for an educated person to get suckered by Fox. There are too many garish infographics and <i>obvious</i> nutjobs. It just does not give even a superficial impression of being Legitimate and Unbiased and Supported by the Best Experts. But the NYT does, and that&#x27;s what makes it more dangerous.<p>If I go into &quot;Uncle Cletus&#x27;s Homeopathy Clinick&quot;, I kind of deserve whatever I get. But if another con man has a convincingly faked (or even real) Harvard M.D., then sets about poisoning lots of people through incompetence and apathy and greed, <i>then</i> everyone insists it can&#x27;t possibly be his fault because he has an M.D. from Harvard...<p>...you can see why &quot;Uncle Cletus is the <i>real</i> problem here&quot; can seem nonresponsive. It is not even especially obvious to me which is &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;Uncle Cletus&quot; or Fake M.D., even if we grant that Fake M.D. is somewhat better at medicine. I know I personally could get suckered by the latter but not the former, making the latter more dangerous <i>to me</i>.')
