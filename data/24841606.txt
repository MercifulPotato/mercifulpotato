Space is too large to go anywhere useful.  The nearest start is ~4 light years away, at 1&#x2F;10th the speed of light (vastly faster than we know how to go) it is 40 years to get here!  We have done a lot of searching for life and haven&#x27;t found it, the closer the planet is, the more likely we are to find it, thus I think it is safe to concluded there is no life within 20 light years or so.  At 20 light years communication via radio is hard to establish just because turn around time for questions won&#x27;t be answered in a lifetime.  (It will be interesting learning about their Roman Empire history, but if they explain science and there is even one thing we don&#x27;t get the person who sends the what do you mean question is retired&#x2F;dead before the answer arrives - unless a few years latter we figure it out anyway.<p>Take the civilization 20 light years away, either they left before they even know we existed (we didn&#x27;t have any emissions that indicated intelligence, though they might be able to detect life), and so they are not equipped to deal with us.  If they want to take over - they didn&#x27;t break enough weapons because they didn&#x27;t expect to need them.<p>Even if life is common in the universe, it isn&#x27;t common in any area where an intelligent civilization can expect to actually reach without FTL.')
