I like that it takes virtually one second to find an opponent match in my time control (5m+0).<p>My play level is around 1800-1900 FIDE (last Classic game played some 10 years ago though), and it is true that I win a lot more than I lose (so I guess that the crowd in Anonymous mode must be somewhere 1400-1900 FIDE), but I still enjoy the games. You can tell by the moves that opponents are more often than not club-level players, and I like not having any idea of what level my opponent has, so I focus on what happens on the board.<p>What I do not like is that, at least in anonymous mode, some players abandon the game without resigning, sometimes just a few moves still in the opening if they get a slightly worse position.  Also for some reason some players play deliberately bad in the opening. Maybe they like the idea of a comeback, but I don&#x27;t like it when it happens.')
