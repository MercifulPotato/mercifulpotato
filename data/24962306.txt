The linked post has the opposite implication of what the author took it to mean, and that link makes it clear that they were referring explicitly to how they&#x27;re typed, not to &quot;actual effectiveness&quot;.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;generic-functions-c-vs-rust&#x2F;21965&#x2F;3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;generic-functions-c-vs-rust&#x2F;21...</a>')
