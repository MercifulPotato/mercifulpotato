Perhaps because I can not unlearn what I knew but it does not make it easier for me, it makes even harder! The syntax is changing, subtlties (one dot or 3 dots?) not specific mentioned etc. all that makes things more confused. Maybe it’ll be easier for kids who will write in their natural English way. I don’t know. But I can not see why Hedy should be better suitable than Scratch for teaching programming for children. The visual, direct manipuable approach of Scratch is very powerful and intuitive at the same time. I’ve seen very smooth transitions from Scratch to other “serious” programming language. I don’t expect that kind of smooth transition by Hedy.')
