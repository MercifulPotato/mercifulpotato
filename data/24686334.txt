Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[24686382, 24686410], score=None, time=1601893848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686296, text='&gt; I think what you&#x27;re missing is that all of the overlapped I&#x2F;O scenarios completions you describe all originate from a hardware interrupt from some device, like a network adapter.<p>The comment literally says &quot;packets came in from client machines&quot;. And they wanted to service these immediately, not 16ms later. Which is exactly what I&#x27;m describing.<p>Timing requirements don&#x27;t arise out of the void. Either they&#x27;re externally mandated based on the wall clock (which is generally for human-oriented things like multimedia) in which case you should probably use something like a periodic multimedia timer, or they&#x27;re based on other internal events (I&#x2F;O, user input, etc.) that you can act on immediately. In neither case does Sleep() seem like the right solution, regardless of its accuracy...<p>Very few real-world exceptions exist to this. In fact the only example I can think of off the top of my head (barring ones whose solution is busy-looping) is &quot;I need to write a debugger that waits for a memory location to change and lets me know ASAP&quot;, in which case, I guess polling memory might be the way to go? But it would seem you would want event-based actions...')
