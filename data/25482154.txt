Bugs were very minor for me.<p>Ai really sucks though and netrunner build is absurdly OP. Once you get suicide and cyberpsychosis + deck that spreads ultimate hacks to two enemies, you turn into a death god, remotely forcing people to kill themselves. Every fight turns into breach-&gt;suicide-&gt;suicide-&gt;suicide at which point all nearby enemies are likely to be dead. Suicide hack really shouldn&#x27;t be in the game, or at least make it so that netrunners can protect allies and can&#x27;t be suicided. At first it&#x27;s fun but gets boring.')
