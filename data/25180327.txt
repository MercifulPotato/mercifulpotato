After all every copy of Windows for decades has come with it and it’s very powerful. They do seem to be rectifying that with PowerShell though.<p>I think it’s unfair hitting the Mac on this front though. Automator is an incredibly easy to use desktop automation tool, and of course you’ve got Bash, Ruby and Python right there just the same as on Linux. They have also invested heavily in work flow automation tooling for iOS.')
