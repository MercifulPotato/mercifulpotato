For example, take those that firmly believe abortion is murder. For them. then aborting this evolved fetus would be considered (to the extent that this applies to mutant non-human primates) the unethical thing to do, NOT the ethical thing to do. However, if you don&#x27;t believe fetuses have inherent rights, etc, then the most ethical thing to do is to destroy the fetus before it does begin to reach that threshold where thorny ethical implications emerge.')
