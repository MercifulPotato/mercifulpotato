Diesel engines have a much lower maximum rpm limit (4.5-5.5k rpms) so they need to deliver that amount of power by delivering more torque at lower RPMs when compared to comparably powered petrol engines.<p>And electric car motors can draw almost maximum Amperes at very low rpms, hence the insane numbers of torque for electric cars')
