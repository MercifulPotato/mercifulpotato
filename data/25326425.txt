There seems to be a significant difference between the US Christmas Tree economy and the one in Germany.<p>We got our tree for this year a week ago directly from a grower in the local area where we always buy our trees. It is of average size (the 6&#x27;-7&#x27; size is also what we mostly consider a good size over here) and it only cost us 30â‚¬, so our prices here seem to be significantly lower than in the US. Also, I don&#x27;t know anybody here who has a fake plastic tree - these aren&#x27;t really a thing here, basically people either don&#x27;t have a tree at all, or they get a real one.')
