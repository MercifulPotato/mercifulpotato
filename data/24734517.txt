There are countless innovations that have allowed these low skill jobs to have an increase in efficiency and productivity.<p>One example, when I was a teen and worked retail I remember we would all have to spend hours going around the store counting every product on the shelves in order to do our routine inventory checks because there was no other reasonable way to track that information. Now many stores have intelligent inventory tracking that requires little to no work from employees.  The end result is that these employees are more efficient, stores need less workers, and stores can carry less inventory.  Why isn&#x27;t the benefit of that efficiency passed on to those employees who are now more efficient?  How is that any different than a software developer receiving a higher salary because they are more efficient due to computers being more powerful?')
