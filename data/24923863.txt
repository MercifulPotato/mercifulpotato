Its designers even anticipated having 16 mouse buttons, and (more importantly) opening a window on a remote system.<p>The system is flexible, programmable, customizable; I&#x27;ve got all development manual volumes here on my shelf.<p>While I&#x27;m open and sympathetic to any new ideas and improved software systems, including novel windowing concepts, personally, I don&#x27;t have any unmet window manager needs at present. Any new system shouldn&#x27;t just replicate a subset of X11, they should go beyond the state of the art to justify the time investment.')
