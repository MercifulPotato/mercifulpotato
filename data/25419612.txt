The vaccine is only to reduce symptoms from turning severe. They hope it can reduce transmission, but those studies aren&#x27;t complete. Also kids and young teens are not going to be vaccinated until probably summer.<p>&gt; First it was 14 days to slow the spread and flatten the curve and somehow they stretched that for a year into wait for the vaccine<p>14 days was the optimistic scenario in which people actually follow rules.
