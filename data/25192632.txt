I am completely overwhelmed by the amount of responses and interest.\nI try my best to keep up with all comments and feedback. \nIt is nearly 23:00 o&#x27;clock here in Germany and I had a day full of surgeries - and my schedule for tomorrow is packed as well. So please forgive me if I have to grab a few hours of sleep and may not be able to answer all questions immediately. I will do my best to keep up with everything as good as possible!<p>Just a few additional information in general in response to some frequently asked questions.<p>The goal of this study is to get a more profound understanding of what aspects and factors of the female breast in connection with breast surgeries are being percieved as aesthetically pleasing.<p>Why is this so important?\nOf course we know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder - and surgery decisions are not based on aesthetics alone.\nBut believe it or not - in the majority of cases patients are overwhelmed by taking decisions regarding the surgery of their own breast. Especially in case of breast cancer, the situation is so difficult and live changing for patients, that it&#x27;s super difficult to take clear decisions or even just focus on own preferences.\nOther obvious factors like medical aspects or potential pain aside - for many patients it is extremely important to get profound pre-operative advice on what &quot;generally&quot; is seen as &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot;.\nE.g. do people like it more if there is a slight asymmetry after breast reconstruction - or is it better to do a correction but therefore have scars.\nThere are many decisions that have to be taken - and for most patients it is very helpful to get good advice.\nOf course there are patients that know exactly what they want - and what their preferences are.\nHowever - as strange is this might sound - for the majority of patients that is not the case.<p>The goal of this study is to get a better understanding of what factors and aspects of the female breast and surgery conditions do have an influence of the aesthetic perception.\nThe survey contains 88 picture pairs - no pair is equal (although some look quite similar). \nThe order of the pictures is being randomized for every participant.\nThe number of 88 pictures is the minimum number that we need to cover every possible &quot;real-life&quot; condition of a breast to get enable a profound statistical analysis.\nSome pictures might seem similar to you - but your decision allows us to gather a lot of data about why you took that decision and thereby better understand what factors really have an influence.\nIn the end, we hope to find out what aspects do matter more than others - in order to then be able to give patients better advice (e.g. scars are percieved as more aesthetical than an asymmetry if the asymmetry is just one cup size).<p>We know that this study is not perfect - but as far is we know it is by far the most sophisticated study in this area so far. Therefore we hope that we can maybe gather new helpful data. \nAnd if only one surgery can be improved, we already helped one patient to get a better result than otherwise.<p>Therefore, thank you all very much for your support and time! \nI will do my best to reply to every comment and feedback!\nThank you, Magnus')
