This gives you a GPU that has 6X the memory, and roughly 25X the performance of the card you would get 13 years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.videocardbenchmark.net&#x2F;compare&#x2F;GeForce-8800-GT-vs-GeForce-GTX-1660-Ti-vs-Radeon-RX-5600-XT&#x2F;1279vs4045vs4186" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.videocardbenchmark.net&#x2F;compare&#x2F;GeForce-8800-GT-v...</a> (see also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techpowerup.com&#x2F;gpu-specs&#x2F;radeon-rx-5600-xt.c3474" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techpowerup.com&#x2F;gpu-specs&#x2F;radeon-rx-5600-xt.c347...</a>).

Sure, due to both to increased demand volatility (multiple waves of crypto booms and busts) as well several generations where Nvidia has simply not had viable competition in the highest performance categories, but even with that in mind, performance&#x2F;$ has still kept climbing in just about every single category. Note: new generation low-mid range cards still haven&#x27;t come out yet. Expect another bump in price&#x2F;performance Q1&#x2F;Q2 next year (GA106 &amp; GA107 for Nvidia, Navi 22 and 23 for AMD, also potentially Intel&#x27;s Xe DG2).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;compare&#x2F;Intel-Core2-Extreme-Q6850-vs-Intel-i9-10900KF&#x2F;1024vs3754" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cpubenchmark.net&#x2F;compare&#x2F;Intel-Core2-Extreme-Q68...</a>')
