Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606171433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192399, text='<i>My understanding is a work for hire contract entitles the writer to royalties if the contract says it does.</i><p>Yes, we agree on that point. However my point is that a WFH contract that entitles the author to royalties is <i>extremely rare.</i> ADF apparently has copies of these contracts (per the SFWA president) and they haven&#x27;t yet shown any portion of the contract actually provides for royalties, which would be extremely rare for a WFH contract.<p><i>Unless you can show a court case where the contract said a work-for-hire author is entitled to royalties and the court threw out that contract provision as &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;not royalties&quot; then I&#x27;m skeptical what you wrote here is correct. </i><p>There are plenty of court cases analyzing what a &quot;royalty&quot; is for both copyright and tax purposes, but the remedy isn&#x27;t to throw out the contract provision if something isn&#x27;t a &quot;royalty.&quot; It simply informs how the contract between the two parties is enforced or the non-contract effects of the transaction. (For example, on the tax side, a royalty is generally subject to different tax rules.) In the IP realm, if a payment isn&#x27;t a royalty, than that would simply mean that it&#x27;s not paid for the right to use IP (but was paid for <i>some other reason</i>).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that ADF isn&#x27;t entitled to get paid <i>something</i> by <i>someone.</i> I&#x27;m simply saying that the facts as provided, given the nature of WFH agreements in Hollywood, suggests very strongly that he isn&#x27;t entitled to <i>royalties.</i>')
