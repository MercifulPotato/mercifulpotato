(Not firefox&#x27;s fault completely)<p>I didn&#x27;t like how they suddenly changed layout on Android and made many extensions unusable.<p>I didn&#x27;t like Mozilla the corp &#x2F; foundation&#x27;s political alignments, a personal opinion and actually I don&#x27;t even care about politics. But we Indians (much like South America I guess), have an aversion to SJW virtue-signalling politics because we have seen how it brings too-much right leaning parties into power. Why would a tech company get into politics at all unless it&#x27;s about some virtue signalling execs pushing their agenda?<p>They fired some actually talented programmers but kept the C-suite, with their non-technical CEO being paid big amounts despite company being in losing game. While I personally don&#x27;t like some aspects of rust community, the language itself is solid and could be a differentiating point for firefox.<p>As soon as I have seen their management take such decisions and their pushing of political agenda, I can&#x27;t trust these people to maintain a browser well. No offense to engineers I was telling about Mozilla itself. So I somehow migrated to chrome. I miss UBO on mobile but bromite is good enough. Google is not much better<p>They may not lose much from a middle-class Indian dude switching to other browser. But think about it. Bringing politics and favoring useless C suite execs is a great way to lose future donors. A company should not do politics. They say they do politics for open web, that&#x27;s not what I am talking about. FSF has done much better than Mozilla foundation in this regard. Mozilla just favoured execs and their agendas before technology, and lost the market.')
