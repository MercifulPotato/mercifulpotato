And some people say they KNOW that it was an inside job.<p>* &quot;especially something for which proof exists&quot; - job of the CIA is to exactly prevent such a thing, they did not.<p>* &quot;or about which there is information&quot;  - come on. I won&#x27;t link conspiracy theory websites here.<p>So, in the end, your definition does not contradict that someone calls the 9&#x2F;11 conspiracy theory a &quot;fact&quot;.<p>The first point is debatable - but then you could apply the same logic to WW1 or any other history event.<p>Therefore, I don&#x27;t like your definition of fact.')
