The “size” of pixel of the two fences together is smaller than the size of the fence grating.<p>A bunch of different overlaps, and some fancy statistics, lets you actually do that with space pictures.<p>In essence, you reduce from the normal pixel size to the area of overlap between pixels. But if you only have the snapshot averages, you have to guess at what the original was — so statistical result.')
