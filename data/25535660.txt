I wondered on reading this, would I try this meat? Probably, (though in small pieces, I understand vegetarians don&#x27;t have the gut flora to process meat and it could be uncomfortable). I absolutely am in favour of lab grown meat. I cannot wait for the day when people complain about not being able to afford real pork, fish or chicken because it&#x27;s too expensive, when we have such strong laws about animal welfare that only the rich or those who farm their own can consume what was a live animal. I&#x27;m sure a black market will exist but on the greater scale, it will be a blessing for the earth.<p>Imagine if, one of the labmeat companies becomes so powerful that they bribe the president of Brazil to make deforestation illegal, and so limiting the amount of land available for cattle and cattle food. I&#x27;ll happily accept this as a weird side effect.')
