VW is massive, and therefore high % growth numbers are hard.<p>VW made $12B in profit last year.<p>&gt;<i>The comparison with Amazon is because not many companies have year after year of CAGR in the realm of what Tesla has achieved.</i><p>Nonsense.  No car companies have, lately, maybe.  But plenty of companies have grown as fast or faster than Tesla.  Their last 3 years of revenue are: $25B, $28B, $31B.  Good, but nowhere approaching 50% CAGR.')
