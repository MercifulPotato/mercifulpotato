All they truly want is a fair and trusted election.  Any claim against this is based purely in conjecture and could easily be proven by simply pushing for some form of voter ID that is not discriminatory.<p>It’s the Democrats that say an ID to vote is racist, while saying an ID is not racist for things like driving, flying, buying alcohol, working, getting a firearm, welfare checks, and so much more.<p>It’s the Democrats that literally removed the signature requirement on ballots?  (PA) What possible reason is there for this, if not to open the door for fraudulent voting, multiple votes per person etc...<p>Not a rhetorical question.  Someone please help me understand the other side of this?')
