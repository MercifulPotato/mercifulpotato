[1]<p>This represents a profound shift in sentiment from just one generation ago whereupon thinkers (such as Chomsky!) would have been fighting the &#x27;other side&#x27; for the ability to speak their minds - as in the case in more classical authoritarian societies (i.e. Belarus).<p>We are not entering a world where &#x27;those evil racist using the n-word are finally being called out&#x27; - frankly - this was already the case for at least generation.<p>We are now entering the phase where people are destroyed for having slightly controversial, but nevertheless respectable opinions that fit within civil discourse.<p>Student unions are banning comedians, and thinkers with whom they disagree.<p>Aside from &#x27;public statements&#x27; - there is of course the reasonable act of <i>contextualization</i>. What people say while they are partying, drinking it up, among one another, as friends, is not &#x27;public discourse&#x27;. This notion that people must live &#x27;professionally sanitized lives every waking moment&#x27; is rubbish. The whole point of &#x27;privacy&#x27; is the ability to speak freely.<p>I&#x27;m concerned by your statement, because as your professional life encroaches upon you with &#x27;greater degrees of responsibility&#x27; - you may be projecting that narrow perspective onto society at large, and risk authoritarian moralizing from a sanitized executive bubble &#x27;where even thoughts are guarded&#x27;.<p>So yes, there are a few dirtbags being called out, but for everyone one of them there&#x27;s a long list of legit thinkers being blacklisted, and a much longer list of regular plebes unable to just act normally, within their own context with the moral beam of globalism like a spotlight upon them at all times.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_Letter_on_Justice_and_Open_Debate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A_Letter_on_Justice_and_Open_D...</a>')
