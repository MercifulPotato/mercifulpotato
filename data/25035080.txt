Any small city (&gt; 50,000 people) has someone who can get you liquid nitrogen in far larger quantities than will ever be needed (thus stuff is used for a lot of industrial processes). Put it in a cooler from wal-mart and you have a week.<p>Any you get a week after thawing it to use is anyway, so you don&#x27;t need the cold storage where the end user is.
