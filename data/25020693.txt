I am considering if&#x2F;when I want to move to the US, they informed me about the likely outcome of this election, which influenced my plans a non trivial amount (not a huge amount either, covid dominates in the planning process, but a non-zero amount).<p>For many people it can influence how they vote. If you&#x27;re in a state with a potential to change the outcome of the election you are more likely to vote &quot;strategically&quot;, i.e. vote for one of the two most popular candidates instead of vote for a third party that you prefer. On the flip side if you&#x27;re voting in a non-competitive race you are much more likely to vote for a candidate who is unlikely to win in order to better indicate your preferences (i.e. you should be more likely to vote libertarian&#x2F;green&#x2F;...).<p>For many people who wins an election affects there careers going forward, in the US in particular a large number of people are fired&#x2F;hired based on the election. Even if you&#x27;re not in that position your industry might get more or less government funding, if you&#x27;re a government contractor the projects you are working on might or might not be in danger of getting cancelled, and so on and so forth. Having better information earlier makes it easier to plan your life.<p>The US election is one of the most significant worldwide events that happens every 4 years, the idea that being able to better predict it is not valuable is... insane.')
