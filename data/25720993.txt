Can someone show me a use case other than trying to cycle over the same data (EDIT: or range) repeatedly where 0-based is fundamentally better than 1-based? I mean, that&#x27;s the only case I can think of where 0-based is actually going to be easier and more sensible.<p>But I&#x27;d argue that languages should stop having fixed offsets, 1-based and 0-based are both too limiting. Ada is around 40 years old (and it&#x27;s not unique in this) and it provides arbitrary index ranges and the option to use any discrete type as the index so that you can use whatever index is most natural for your particular problem.')
