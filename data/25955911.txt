Because you&#x27;ve just granted the government the right to use its monopoly on force to remove fundamental rights like freedom of speech and association from the people running any website which meets some arbitrary &quot;population reach&quot; threshold.</i><p>Actually it&#x27;s the opposite: I &quot;granted the government the right to use its monopoly on force to ENFORCE fundamental rights like freedom of speech and association from the people running any website which meets some arbitrary &quot;population reach&quot; threshold&quot;.<p>And the arbitrary threshold wont be that arbitrary if it&#x27;s legally defined. We have lots of such thresholds in law (from &quot;age of consent&quot; and &quot;21 to be allowed to drink&quot;, to &quot;statue of limitations&quot;).<p>&gt;<i>You just disagree with companies having the right to choose with whom they do business</i><p>They can pick their vendors (whom they do business with), but not their users, same way a grocery store can&#x27;t (and doesn&#x27;t in a civilized country) just send you away (&quot;refusal of service&quot;).')
