But such infrastructure comes with its own caveats.<p>EBS now bugs me about some &#x27;HealthCheckAuthEnabled&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know what it wants, just that I have limited time to react. Cannot understand the clearly auto-translated text. Still didn&#x27;t get what it wants from me when I read it in English. I banned the health check from my logs and said where it can get a response from the service I run. I hoped our friendship ended there. Maybe it did and this is some form of retaliation.<p>The load balancer AWS set up for me now suddenly costs money. And I thought I could just use it to grab the free TLS cert that comes with it... well, the clients pay for the additional costs anyway and I would be surprised if anyone even noticed the price spike. The traffic is minimal but I am surprised it is actually that expensive. I could probably cut the costs in half if I actually had motivation to look through all the settings...<p>Microsoft just cancelled some features of some online service my colleague works with because they want to market an alternative for their BI solution. Did cost him 3 weeks of work at the minimum. The stuff cannot be ported to an on-premise version.<p>Hosting your own server is a lot of work and isn&#x27;t fun. There is still a lot of work to do if you host on something on such an infrastructure.<p>Somehow the amount of work you have to put into software hasn&#x27;t decreased. Honestly the main argument for it is that you can give away responsibilities.<p>edit: Just noticed that EBS probably counts as PaaS instead of serverless. I run &quot;stuff&quot; (very simple functions) on Lambda too, but to think it would replace apps like the article suggested seems a bit much. It has its purpose, but nearly everything I have on Lambda is AWS cloud specific. It comes in handy for Alexa integrations for example. I think the container won this fight to be honest.')
