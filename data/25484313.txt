It stops puberty, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent it. If you stop taking the drug, the process of puberty will resume completely as normal. Its purpose is not to begin the sex change process, but to allow time for planning what the next steps are (usually, hormone replacement therapy), so you are not racing against a biological clock.')
