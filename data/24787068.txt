Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602759000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783240, text='&gt;I am agreeing with refurb&#x27;s comment below you. Most people calling &quot;fake news&quot; are trying to convince you to not watch something.  Most people calling &quot;disinformation&quot; are trying to convince you that you should not be able to watch something.<p>Huh?<p>You state that criticism is different than censorship.  I agree.<p>However, I don&#x27;t get the connection here.  Calling something &quot;fake news&quot; or calling it &quot;disinformation&quot;  are both criticisms.  In fact, those terms are pretty much synonymous.<p>Which is irrelevant to the issue.<p>Twitter and Facebook are limiting distribution of this particular piece.  Which is certainly akin to censorship.  However, It&#x27;s Twitter and Facebook taking these actions, not &quot;most people.&quot;<p>Based on the details I&#x27;ve read (and thanks to this post, I&#x27;ve read quite a few), this story doesn&#x27;t really pass the smell test, and may well be &quot;disinformation.&quot;<p>Will you now accuse <i>me</i> of advocating censorship?<p>What if I&#x27;d said it was &quot;fake news&quot; instead?  Am I advocating censorship now?<p>Calling for censorship would be something like &quot;Don&#x27;t let anyone see that!&quot; Or &quot;These monsters need to be silenced!&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a difference.<p>Unfortunately, we&#x27;re all wrapped so tightly because, you guessed it, Twitter and Facebook (and others) use exactly those sorts of tricks to rile us up, to boost engagement and make more advertising dollars.<p>Which leaves us fighting each other over which <i>synonym</i> is worse.<p>In truth, <i>most</i> people are kind, decent human beings who just want to have a decent life.  Sure, we disagree about a few of the details concerning <i>how</i> to have a decent life, but we agree about many more details.<p>The interactions of a bunch of really small groups who want to influence us for <i>their</i> benefit (whether that be for political power, profit or both) are laughing all the way to the bank as we tear each other apart.<p>Let&#x27;s not let them do that any more, as we&#x27;re only hurting ourselves.')
