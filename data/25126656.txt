That&#x27;s why you see so many Electron apps. Seriously, we don&#x27;t need to wrap a whole browser. Just the engine and a debugger would&#x27;ve been fine.<p>The engine could be distributed as a lib and other frameworks could just bind it. Apps could be distributed without an 150MB behemoth just to have a chat client.<p>Making the engine also mobile compatible would mean Android and iOS could maybe have the same base. I also look forward to what this means for Linux phones. Custom browsers could be written for those that don&#x27;t have to use WebKit or try to launch Chromium or Firefox on a mobile device.<p>Not only for mobile devices, but also displaying things in VR can be made significantly easier if you don&#x27;t have to write all the UI yourself. Give it an opengl rectangular surface (or vulkan?) and you can then use web technologies to make UIs in VR.<p>All in all, I&#x27;m very for an engine. It would definitely allow a competitor with a good name to enter the market. Developer should be able to reach for something else than WebKit because nobody in their right mind is going to reach for Gecko.')
