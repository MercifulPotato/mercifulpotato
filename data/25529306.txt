(Wear shorts that have pockets).<p>This is the kind of trade off that people who get really into something make, they don’t put on a pair of running shorts that weigh 2-3 oz. and slip an ID in there, to avoid the extra weight.  I get it, I have some hobbies that I’m pretty serious about — but the point of the above EMT’s post is to think through what would happen <i>in the event of the worst</i>. If I got hit by a bus, whether or not I was dead, I’d want someone to be able to call my mom pretty fast. That’s hard when you’re optimizing for the version of the experience where everything goes well.<p>One thing I recommend is getting an extra disposable ID to carry while biking or running. It would be a pain to replace my driver’s license but my NYC ID is just a matter of filling out a form online.')
