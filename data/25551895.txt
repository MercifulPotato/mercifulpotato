I kept waiting for a clear answer to &quot;THE root cause&quot;. Since then I&#x27;ve read things like Dekker&#x27;s work, and come to realize that blame is not a productive way of thinking in complex systems.<p>A quick example: in many car accidents, you can easily point to the person who caused the accident; for example the person who runs a red light, texts and drives, or drives drunk is easily found at fault. But what about a case where someone 3 or 4 car lengths ahead makes a quick lane change and an accident occurs behind them?')
