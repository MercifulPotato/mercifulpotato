Skeptical about exactly the wrong things, repeatedly wrong year after year, yet ever so trusting of the same bullshit sources and rhetoric, as long as it resonates with their prime belief about the superiority of their culture&#x2F;religion.<p>I see this in mainstream US too, with the antivaxxers who got a C in high school biological or 5G crazies who couldn’t pass a physics class.<p>Once someone has formed an identity around some core assumptions of the world, anything that challenges it will be seen as an attack on one’s ego.')
