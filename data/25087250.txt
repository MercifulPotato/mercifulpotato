JS’s specific implementation is definitely the odd one out, like the article says.<p>One of the funny things about Go’s automatic semicolons is that you can easily trip up gofmt if you type sloppy code and expect gofmt to clean it up for you. For example, let’s say you type this:<p><pre><code>    func foo() {\n        if x &lt; 3 {\n            return 1\n        } return 2\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou think, “Oh, I missed the enter key when I was typing it but gofmt will fix it for me.” No, it will not. Syntax error.')
