Is ethics not taught in Israeli Computer Science curricula?<p>Personal opinion, but I think the mandatory army service in Israel seems to teach that everything is &#x27;defense&#x27; and Israel is always &#x27;defending itself&#x27;, no matter what, this sort of thinking then bleeds into the private sector as these guys leave the military and use the skills they learned there to establish businesses.<p>Having interacted with the Palestinians during their army service as &#x27;the enemy&#x27;, the victims of NSO undoubtedly fall into the same category, thus not worth loosing their sleep over.')
