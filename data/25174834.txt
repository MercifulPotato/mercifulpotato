I didn&#x27;t even realize there was an upper limit. It&#x27;s a tax that only applies to &quot;lower&quot; income workers. Highly regressive.<p>Also, US income taxes are only nominally progressive. There are so many loopholes that very wealthy people (most infamously the POTUS) can end up paying no taxes whatsoever. Tax dodging is a science and an art. Didn&#x27;t Warren Buffett say he paid a lower rate than his secretary?')
