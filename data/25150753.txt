So much so, that during math, one other kid and I were sat outside the classroom in the hallway, and with very little assistance from the teachers, given worksheets on base-5 math. I essentially taught myself what different bases are, what digits represent, and so on.<p>I thought of this the other day as I listened to Radiolab do a thoroughly <i>piss poor</i> job of explaining binary, as part of a larger discussion about computer memory and the relevance of 4096 to a computer error.<p>I mean, they spent a lot of time talking about light bulbs going on and off, and then how, if you represent 2, you flick one bulb off and another on, but if you represent 3, you leave the first bulb on, etc. They did finally mention powers, but not in a generic sense. They didn&#x27;t ever mention that binary is &quot;just&quot; base 2 math like normal math is base 10.<p>It seemed so contrived. I know they were trying to explain it to the layman, but it seems they actually made it more conceptually difficult.<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to rant about this and here seems like the best spot.')
