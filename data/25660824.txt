Item(by='ShinyCyril', descendants=8, kids=[25660828, 25671759, 25661337, 25671340], score=17, time=1609959141, title="Ask HN: What's the road to micropayments being a first-class citizen of the web?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been going down a rabbit-hole these past few days investigating why there still does not exist a ubiquitous solution for micropayments on the web.<p>What requirements must a micropayment solution fulfil to be considered as the de-facto standard for the web? Where do current solutions fall short? Which are the most promising solutions today?<p>I certainly remember using Flattr a long time ago â€” what ever became of that? It seems that &quot;Donate Bitcoin&quot;, Patreon, PayPal and &quot;Buy me a coffee&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buymeacoffee.com) are the most popular methods of supporting projects on the web these days. However these have always felt like a stop-gap solution compared to being able to, for example, click a button and have your browser send a payment of $0.01 to unlock an article.<p>Brave Browser (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com) seems to be a project which crops up frequently, although it prescribes a very specific model (use a <i>specific</i> browser, voluntarily view privacy-respecting ads, earn tokens and distribute tokens to enrolled websites that you visit). Is it likely that the Basic Attention Token (the &quot;currency&quot; that enables the interaction described above) will be included with other browsers?<p>Then of course there is the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which sidesteps some of the limitations of on-chain transactions. Strike (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.strike.me) seems to be the missing piece, which provides an end-to-end solution for sending fiat currency by using the Bitcoin Lightning Network as the underlying payment transport.<p>There is also Stellar, which it seems is more concerned with providing a method of sending payments, than being its own currency, although the native currency &quot;Lumens&quot; are still required to complete a transaction (as I understand).<p>Stepping outside of the cryptocurrency world, there is also GNU Taler (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taler.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;), a project to create a privacy-preserving payment system using existing banking infrastructure.')
