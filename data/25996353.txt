Item(by='stared', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612228171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994332, text='I have ADHD, and I use Modafinil or Armodafinil at low doses (50+50mg or 75mg, respectively).<p>It does not make &quot;high&quot; in any sense. It does not create dependency (unlike, say, coffee). If I don&#x27;t take it (and I often don&#x27;t), there are no negative effects, just a lack of the positive.<p>Metylofenidat helps me a bit, but it gives &quot;deadline-like focus&quot;. Focus, but rush, with increased anxiety.<p>(Ar)modafinil gives sniper-like focus. Decreased anxiety and emotional reactiveness, while still maintaining full emotional clarity. Non-deadline flow.<p>The first time I took Modafinil, I didn&#x27;t feel like &quot;on drugs&quot;. I felt the opposite - for the first time distractions (like checking FB every a few minutes) were not dopamine hits I craved. I understood a lot about &quot;other people&quot; and things people kept telling me for two decades. It seems that being less distractible was an everyday experience.<p>The only downside I saw is that it needs to be taken well before bedtime (as in: morning, noon) and that it makes one way less social (immunity to jokes, increased sensory sensitivity, &quot;OK, but what&#x27;s your point&quot; approach to conversations, etc).<p>Readings:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;16&#x2F;nootropics-survey-results-and-analysis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;16&#x2F;nootropics-survey-resu...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Modafinil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;Modafinil</a>')
