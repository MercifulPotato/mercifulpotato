I think it&#x27;s just a question of shortening the life of the rotor a bit.<p>Another problem is visibility. We had to land in a hurry at the end of my lesson on Monday due to rain arriving at the airfield. I fly a Magni M16 which is an open cockpit and it was quite hard to see with the rain on the windscreen and my visor. There are no wipers or anything to help with that (like you might have on a fixed wing). I don&#x27;t have the comparable experience in the closed cockpit aircraft though (e.g. Magni M24), so that may be better anyway.')
