The framework I&#x27;ve used is Flux[1] which I love for it&#x27;s simplicity, it is very much like the DarkNet[2] framework in that regard which is refreshing after using TensorFlow. PyTorch is much better about not having unnecessary complexity and a sensible API but Flux is certainly better.<p>The ability for Julia to compile directly to PTX assembly[3][4] means that you can even write the GPU kernels in Julia and eliminate the C&#x2F;C++ CUDA code. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of work to be done to make it as reliably fast and easy as TensorFlow&#x2F;PyTorch so I don&#x27;t think it is usable for production yet.<p>I hope it will be production ready soon but it will likely take some time to highly tune the compute stacks. They are already working on AMD GPU support with AMDGPU.jl[5] and with the latest NVIDIA GPU release which has IMHO purposefully decreased performance (onboard RAM, power) for scientific compute application I would love to be able to develop on my AMD GPU workstation and deploy on whatever infrastructure easily in the same language.<p>I do have some gripes with Julia but the biggest of them are mostly cosmetic.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluxml.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluxml.ai&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pjreddie&#x2F;darknet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pjreddie&#x2F;darknet</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpu-computing-julia-programming-language&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpu-computing-julia-progra...</a><p>[4]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.maleadt.net&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;julia-cuda&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.maleadt.net&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;julia-cuda&#x2F;</a><p>[5]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaGPU&#x2F;AMDGPU.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaGPU&#x2F;AMDGPU.jl</a>')
