You&#x27;re 100% correct that Trump has been provoking violence for years now (e.g. &quot;If she [Hillary] gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks...although the Second Amendment people ... maybe there is&quot; &#x2F; &quot;When the looting starts, the shooting starts&quot;).<p>Zuckerberg just knows now that Democrats will be in power so this is a safe move to appear like he hasn&#x27;t been perfectly fine helping Trump increase the spread of his violent platform (&quot;Facebook cannot be the arbiter of truth&quot;). It was all about allowing &quot;engagement&quot; that helped Facebook&#x27;s revenue.<p>Zuckerberg does not get to change the narrative now.')
