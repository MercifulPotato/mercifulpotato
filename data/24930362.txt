When I was at school it was _the_ insult to use, and in the context of an adjective meant that things were lame, pathetic and bad. It was used everywhere and constantly, and as someone who identified as LGBT every time I heard it in passing I&#x27;d panic slightly and my heart would skip a beat.<p>This is the exact opposite though. The `--gay` flag is the best option; it&#x27;s the most colourful, flashy and fun. I _want_ more people to use the term in a positive context because every time it happens, the pejorative context looses more power and anything that stops these sorts of words being weaponised is a good thing.<p>And as other commenters have already said, it gets defined in dictionaries as &quot;light-hearted and carefree&quot; or &quot;brightly coloured; showy.&quot;, both of which descriptions fit the use case perfectly.')
