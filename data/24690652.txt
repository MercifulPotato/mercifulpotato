Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601923389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24688042, text='&gt;Most convenience stores in the USA won&#x27;t accept $100 bills AFAIK.<p>At some point, with some marginal exceptions (such as dollar coins that have never been that widely used and a $2 bill ditto), the US at some point apparently decided that it was going to keep the same coins and bills in general circulation forever. So we still have essentially valueless pennies and $100 bills, while in circulation, aren&#x27;t taken by a lot of places in the US. They&#x27;re even a bit hard to get. I had to go to a couple of bank branches last time I needed to restock my &quot;emergency&quot; travel cash supply.')
