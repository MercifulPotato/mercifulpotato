Consider, edges (other than the keypoint controlled ones) aren&#x27;t even in exactly the same place-- so the residual doesn&#x27;t just need to code the edge, it needs to code it twice.  This has been one of the big impediments in using &#x27;synthesis&#x27; techniques in video coding generally.<p>It might be possible to code a residual in some latent NN space and get more useful results, however.')
