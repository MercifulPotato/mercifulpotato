A tiling compositor actually has far <i>far</i> more power to beat windows into submission than an Xorg based WM ever could. Surfaces can’t move, steal focus, put popups anywhere without the compositor having a say and, potentially, just saying no.<p>And GNOME has removed support for xembed tray icons in favor AppIndicator which is just a generic dbus interface which a tiling WM can actually sanely implement.')
