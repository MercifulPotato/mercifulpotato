Const in JS is an immutable reference that  doesn&#x27;t change the mutability of the value referenced, so an object will be mutable though you can&#x27;t reassign a different object.<p>By JS strings are immutable, and String.prototype.replace doesn&#x27;t modify in place, it returns a fresh string. So, this shouldn&#x27;t be possible as described.')
