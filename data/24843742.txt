Do you know if the Radeon cards throttle automatically when they get too hot?  Did you have any custom cooling?  I can&#x27;t imagine they would perform all that great at 140F if they throttles themselves, but them doing so may have kept them functional and error free at the expense of hiding poor performance, unless you have data showing otherwise (and you totally might, it seems like the person setting up that system might also check to ensure it&#x27;s performing to spec :) )')
