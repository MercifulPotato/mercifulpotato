The government regulations are also already there, i&#x27;m not proposing that either.<p>I&#x27;m just proposing we auction to increasingly higher salaries so all those people get nice high wages. The H1b system is to get the best and brightest for talent we cannot find locally, so paying these immigrants handsomely seems like the right thing to do. Its also good business, because high end R&amp;D facilities should not be crossing their fingers for luck in hiring, they should be able to purchase talent by bidding for it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this benefits the richest incumbents -- the pool of workers continues to be the same. It benefits companies who desperately need the most talented workers by making them pay fairly for that top talent.<p>Frankly, if some company thinks they need the best-of-the-best and cant pay fairly for it, do they really need the best of the best?')
