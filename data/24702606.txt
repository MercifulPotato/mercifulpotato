Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[24702720], score=None, time=1602020337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702130, text='&gt;<i>The US government, in contrast, is mostly funded by taxes on wealthy people: &quot;the top 50 percent of all taxpayers paid 97 percent of all individual income taxes, while the bottom 50 percent paid the remaining 3 percent.&quot;</i><p>This isn&#x27;t painting the full tax picture though. It only looks at a subset of federal taxes and ignores non-federal taxes (maybe you meant &#x27;federal&#x27; when you said &#x27;U.S.&#x27;?). For example, payroll taxes fall disproportionately (on a percentage of income basis) on the non-wealthy and make up 36% of federal taxes but aren&#x27;t included in income tax stats.[1]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;federal-tax&#x2F;policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;federal-tax&#x2F;policy-basics-wher...</a>')
