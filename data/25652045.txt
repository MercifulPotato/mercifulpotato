I appreciate the thoughts, although it doesn&#x27;t sound like I am as bad off as you were in this case.<p>I can hugely sympathize with on-call bleeding into other parts of your life&#x2F;career though. One of the things I detest most about the current setup is that on-call is considered to be a 100% &quot;extra&quot; obligation. Even if you were up all night responding to pages, you are still expected to be back in your seat on time the next morning and working at full throttle. Unless it&#x27;s a <i>really</i> outlying case, then no allowances are made on adjusting other expectations for the work you&#x27;re doing outside of work hours.<p>It sounds like this is what happened to you. Sorry to hear it, and hope you found something better.')
