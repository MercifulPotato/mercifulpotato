It hasn&#x27;t been difficult at my last few jobs including the current one where many&#x2F;most of us have been remote for years.<p>You get added to the email lists, the slack channels, the documentation wiki, and the issue tracker.  Daily meetings at 10am.  You pair up with one person for a couple weeks and then somebody else and so on for the first few months.  You regularly have voice and&#x2F;or video chats.  You get, or create, a list of who to contact with different questions or problems.<p>If somehow <i>all</i> of those communication methods fail, I doubt that just being able to add a physical touch component would help much.  Other than touch, the only senses that require physical proximity are smell and taste.  If you&#x27;re relying on touch, smell, and taste to communicate while on-boarding people, then maybe then it might be difficult, but that also seems a bit unusual.<p>Mostly I think companies that have trouble with on-boarding remotely have bigger problems with their communications in general.')
