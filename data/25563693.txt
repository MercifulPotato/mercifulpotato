If you do high uptimes (say &gt;99.95%) rounding starts to matter.<p>If you want the less bureaucratic version: downtime for mission critical apps means customers call. Immediately. If your SaaS to manage a container terminal is down, that means the container terminal is down. That turns very expensive very fast. Knowing the system is down before you receive the first call is vital. Monitoring once a minute and taking 2 failing calls before reporting means you have a 2 minute delay. That is the difference between telling the customer &#x27;yes, we&#x27;ve noticed and we&#x27;re working on it&#x27;  versus &#x27;what downtime?&#x27; on the phone<p>EDIT: I looked into your startup, and definitely love that pricing model. That seems like the right stategy, and beats other monitoring solutions easily at scale (&gt;10 hosts seems to be the cross-over point roughly). If you can report downtime within say 20s of it actually occurring via a webhook or Slack integration or so, I&#x27;d love to have an invite. E-mail is in my profile.')
