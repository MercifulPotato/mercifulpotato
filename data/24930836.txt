If the asset being purchased is a home, incentives between buyer and seller are aligned and prices are higher than the non-laundering market would support (esp if there&#x27;s another launderer who&#x27;s interested).<p>This is true but misleading. The money launderer doesn&#x27;t want to throw away money. They want to launder money as cheaply as possible. That said, they are willing to pay far more than an asset is &quot;worth&quot; if they expect to be able to resell it for a price equal to or even slightly lower than they paid. The loss is the &quot;price&quot; of laundering. This supports higher prices for real estate, but not arbitrarily high prices, because if the launderer pays too much, they will simply have to resell for less, leaving money on the table that they could have kept.')
