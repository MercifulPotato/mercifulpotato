TIFF does, but in practice it&#x27;s always uncompressed (did it even support compression in the 90s?). Either solution didn&#x27;t allow for text blocks or vector zooming or form fields.<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to improve upon a sane subset of PDF, but that would require backing and coordination. Reviving XPS (but not under MS auspices) should also be possible.')
