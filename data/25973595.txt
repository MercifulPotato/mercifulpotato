This is usually handled by dead-reckoning[1]<p>For large scale, low bandwidth games(AKA RTSes and the like where gamestate is deterministic) that&#x27;s handled via lock-step[2]. The gamestate is 100% deterministic and all clients move together with a shared set of inputs in &quot;lock step&quot;.<p>Both of these approaches can be tolerant to latencies up to ~600ms(back in the ole 28.8&#x2F;56k days of &#x27;97 SubSpace[3] was doing ~300 players in one zone with a high skill curve and a robust netcode). They usually mask it with client side reactions that are then reconciled with the server in a robust way. If you&#x27;re just dropping video frames over a network stack none of that is available to you no matter how fancy your FEC or other tricks are.<p>Somehow I&#x27;ve now got the urge to go dust off the Continuum client again and boot up SubSpace.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;feature&#x2F;131638&#x2F;dead_reckoning_latency_hiding_for_.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;feature&#x2F;131638&#x2F;dead_reckoning...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meseta.medium.com&#x2F;netcode-concepts-part-3-lockstep-and-rollback-f70e9297271" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meseta.medium.com&#x2F;netcode-concepts-part-3-lockstep-a...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;352700&#x2F;Subspace_Continuum&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;352700&#x2F;Subspace_Continuum...</a>')
