The first method is far more difficult.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about this too. I don&#x27;t think the hardware needs to be this weak&#x2F;slow. It just needs to be analyzable. Modern silicon chips can only be inspected with electron microscopes, and even then, they have multiple layers, so it&#x27;s a non-starter. You could probably spend multiple lifetimes studying a modern chip.<p>On the other hand, if you take a chip like the good old ARM1, it&#x27;s a 32-bit chip with no cache and about 25K transistors. If you fabricated it with an older process, with a single layer, it might be possible to inspect it with a regular microscope, and you could use basic computer vision to compare the layout against a reference implementation that you have an HD picture of. It&#x27;s a relatively weak chip, but you may be able to clock it at 50 or 100 MHz. It&#x27;s fast enough to run basic UI apps and networked services. It&#x27;s 32-bit so you could address a few gigabytes of RAM (well, maybe not with an ARM1 design, but with a comparable 32-bit RISC-V, say).')
