Furthermore, we believe that traditional lending models based on the relationship with the bank are fundamentally flawed in terms of scalability &amp; distribution. We want to take a different approach it via the transactional lending model.<p>Any resources&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;courses related to transactional lending and trade finance is highly appreciated.<p>P.S: I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;ve exhausted all my resources that I could find on the google and was hoping some of you can help.')
