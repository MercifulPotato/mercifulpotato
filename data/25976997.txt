We have a hybrid system.<p>- Insurance is generally affordable (I pay $1200AUD, just over $900USD, a YEAR).<p>- GP visits are free. There are a few privates that might cost $50++ per consult. But a decent GP that works in the public system can be found.<p>- Specialist visits are subsidised without needing insurance and are similar cost to a GP consult in the US depending on who you see. Wait times can be long, but your GP will know several specialists whom they trust and can give several referrals. I’ve never waited more than 4 weeks.<p>- Mental health consults are free with a referral. You get Max 12 free a year.<p>- Specialist procedures can take many months in the public system. True. But they are available for free. And a free system that saves some lives and gives everyone a shot is better than a private only system that just serves the rich.<p>- Insurance is affordable so you can enter the private system. Some procedures just cost the excess. This is very quick.<p>- All billable items must be disclosed upfront. There are no surprises.<p>- Medication is cheaper.<p>No system is perfect, but ours are vastly more affordable and effective per dollar than the US system. To argue about waiting for specialist procedures when a GP consultation could cost $100USD without insurance (source: last American I spoke to who visited a doctor in the US) is simply ludicrous. Last year I maxed my mental health allowance, had GP appointments at least once a month and did a range of tests. Total cost: $0. Specialists and hospital: $800-900AUD. Meds: $200AUD. It was a bad year for me. Still way less than a year of US insurance.')
