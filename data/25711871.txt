And they suggest the communication scale of the actor being blocked should not be a factor in the management criteria applied to the speech flowing across a given channel.<p>That&#x27;s a principled position but it&#x27;s also ludicrous - and it&#x27;s impossible to take advice from that position which can then be applied to the real world.  It&#x27;s as tho they&#x27;ve said &quot;yes, we acknowledge that free speech faces limits -- such as no yelling fire in a crowded theater -- but we do not acknowledge the existence of crowded theaters&quot;.  What kind of advice are we left to take from such philosophizing?<p>Text sent over the largest of megaphones is just not the same thing as text sent over the much smaller megaphones available to most social media users.<p>Taking the EFF position espoused here to an extreme for illustration -- suppose Alice decides to use the emergency broadcast system as her personal twitter account for a day.  With her every message all the cell phones in the country buzz an emergency broadcast alert letting us know what Alice wants to say.  She exercises her right to political speech to let us all know that she thinks birth control pills are evil -- and in so doing she consumes some seconds of attention from 300 million people.  At the same time -- she cross-posts to her twitter where she is followed by 50 people.<p>The EFF are more or less suggesting that the same principles and rules should apply to her twitter posts and her emergency broadcast system posts.<p>But in reality -- do we consider these information publishing channels directly comparable?  Are we forced to accept that because these are both information publishing channels -- the set of things Alice is allowed to say on both channels must be the same?<p>Obviously we are not forced to take this position.  And obviously this is a bit of a silly example since we all already know that different rules apply to the emergency broadcasting network -- yet we don&#x27;t use the word &quot;censor&quot; to describe the set of things we don&#x27;t want Alice to send out over the emergency broadcast network -- and why is that?<p>Going back to\nmy claim that they are silencing themselves -- I think the EFF position in this article is basically abstract philosophy and that they are going out of their way to avoid addressing any of the specifics required to guide action in the real world.  They had an opportunity to say something useful -- instead they said nothing in more words.')
