The flat look has been a disaster from a usability point of view, but it also has been a disaster from a differentiation point of view. If native Outlook app looks no different or better than the Web version then there is no longer any reason to maintain the native app.<p>For native apps to succeed over Web — and Steve Jobs has shown this can be done — it must have a differentiated look &amp; feel, and users must find the look &amp; feel attractive. The Flat look and feel meets neither of these criteria. Microsoft pioneered the Flat look and feel, and it has since been copied by Apple, which &quot;proved&quot; the wisdom of Microsoft&#x27;s move. But it has been downhill for Windows native apps since then.')
