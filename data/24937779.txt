Our governments are corrupt and businesses are too large; the best we can hope for is protecting consumers as much as possible in attainable ways.<p>I would like to see a law which states that businesses cannot revoke your access to any discrete good you&#x27;ve purchased. Arguably, media companies wouldn&#x27;t be the primary aggrieved party of a law like that; it really hurts Amazon (et al) more than anyone, being legally forced to continue serving video files you&#x27;ve purchased even in the face of Terms of Service breaches and such.<p>Which is perfect. That&#x27;s exactly what we want. If Amazon <i>has</i> to guarantee access to content, the easiest way to fulfill that requirement is to offer downloads for customers (which I think <i>should</i> be a fulfillment of that requirement, and its alright if they terminate an account so long as a download was offered for all content). Of course, the Media companies Definitely don&#x27;t want that, so now we have the media companies and tech companies fighting each other. Laws which disrupt the alignment of incentives between companies are the best kind of laws.')
