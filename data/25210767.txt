It&#x27;s such a lazy response to OPs point...<p>Are humans animals? If so, should we not consume the products that humans create, in order to achieve perfect veganism? And if people are <i>not</i> animals, and I&#x27;m feeling a bit hungry........?<p>The computer or phone you used to post your comment is an animal product. Unless, yet again, we consider humans to be <i>above</i> animals, and therefore exempt from all the rules, and veganism is cannibalizing itself, philosophically.<p>Absolutist veganism (which is a beautiful idealism) exists heavily in a state of cognitive dissonance.')
