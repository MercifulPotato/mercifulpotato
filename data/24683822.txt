We are all human and flawed in some way. So, naturally, those flaws will be exposed or even exploited in a platform like Facebook.<p>The difference between humans pre and post social media is that the we have a platform now that amplifies many voices.<p>We also treat it as a news source - and as we know, bad news has always outsold light fluffy good news when it comes to competing for our attention.<p>Couple that with the issue that engagement (comments, likes, shares) increase how visible a post is and you get the recipe for how to rapidly help polarize a society.<p>This is of course to say that we were already polarized and already arguing with each other, but now we can do it with more reach and with a louder voice.')
