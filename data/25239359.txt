I haven&#x27;t done lisp in a long time but I&#x27;m trying to get back into CL.<p>One question: using SBCL I can run the script with sbcl --script contemplate.lisp but how do I load the koans into the repl in a way that has all the helper&#x2F;test functions available? If I just (load &quot;test-framework.lisp&quot;) or do sbcl --load contemplate.lisp, I get a bunch of warnings and things like (assert-equal t t) throw &quot;undefined function&quot;. It&#x27;s mentioned in the original PR that this &quot;should&quot; be possible now but I didn&#x27;t see it in the README.<p>One thing I&#x27;m very not familiar with yet is the quicklisp&#x2F;abcl and packaging system so this is probably very obvious. Thanks!')
