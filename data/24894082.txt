People are just prone to interpret normal fluctuation as catastrophic decline. They were saying similar things about HN well over a decade ago. It always reminds me of what Voltaire said when told that he drank too much coffee and that it was a slow poison: &quot;It must be very slow&quot;. [1]<p>Taibbi pieces have had more significant threads here than most political commentators. If HN did as you seem to be suggesting and disallowed flags on any articles like this—the ones that you like, plus the ones that everyone else likes, since why should one user be privileged over another?—then the site would consist of nothing but articles like this. That&#x27;s obviously not its mandate. I don&#x27;t see how this is &quot;Orwellian&quot;, but it&#x27;s not always easy to know WWOD (what would Orwell do).<p>[1] Actually it was Fontenelle but Voltaire makes for a better story. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;</a>')
