Word has automatic numbering, true, but it&#x27;s not necessarily designed for the sort that was used in this paper.<p>2. From the article:<p>&gt; <i>Note added 2020.12.07: ... Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph, like the paragraphs in this blog post, adjacent to the left margin.</i><p>They were numbering paragraphs, not line items, and lines that wrapped were supposed to be left-justified. I don&#x27;t think this is a strawman.<p>3. MS Word would have a fit with skipping a number before &quot;They&quot; in the sentence above, and assigning number 3 and not 1 to this paragraph.<p>4. There are other cases when you need to separately label Article 1&#x2F;Section A&#x2F;Clause I etc. in a hierarchy; the numbered list tabulation and hopefully semantic Heading 1&#x2F;Heading 2&#x2F;Heading 3 styles and tables of contents in Word can handle this for your use case, but be prepared for frustration if you want something a little different than what the UI is designed to help you build.')
