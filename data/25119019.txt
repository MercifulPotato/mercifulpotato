Saying that someone who was badly sick with covid who died of a heart attack “died of covid complications” is a statement that passes the sniff test.<p>Personally, I find the arguments over precise covid numbers a bit baffling. For comparison, there are battles between nation states within my lifetime where the estimate on how many combatants died range by over an order of magnitude. Not civilians killed in the area, enlisted soldiers. Getting accurate death counts is really, really hard, even in smaller organizations. Across all the counties in the US, mistakes will happen. In the end if a few thousand cases here and there get miscounted, I won’t be surprised in the slightest.')
