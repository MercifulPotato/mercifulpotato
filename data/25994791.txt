When I moved back to the US, I searched for one of them and could only find steam and evaporative humidifiers like this Honeywell one.  Having small children, I went for the Honneywell humidifier and hated it - I was stupefied that it had such good reviews.  So I searched for &quot;safe&quot; steam humidifiers and couldn&#x27;t find one, so I gave up.<p>Last year, I noticed that ultrasonic humidifiers were now very popular and cheap on Amazon, and got one.  The review sites recommended against them, due to supposed calcium and bacteria build-up, but I haven&#x27;t seen any problems, and the Honeywell was definitely worse on these fronts.<p>Get an ultrasonic humidifier - they are cheap and if they break, you can get another one.  Just used filtered water in them.')
