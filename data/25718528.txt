Do my comments ring any less true?<p>As I explained above, you <i>also</i> don&#x27;t believe <i>just</i> those images that got them banned, it&#x27;s the context they exist in that matters, that&#x27;s literally what the next line says!<p>And of course I explained exactly why I can confidently say Parler&#x27;s ratio of hate speech would be higher... because their differentiator is literally not moderating hate speech since it counts as free speech.')
