Its the game where you are not locked in room with demons but they are locked in room with you.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re an unkillable demigod that&#x27;s basically dunking on armies of demons<p>That is the 100% the core idea of Doom lore.<p>Tldr: The doom marine was entangled with &#x27;hell&#x27; and at some stage was tricked that his dead son could be brought to life by a some demon deal - he came back as twisted undead. Doomguy got really angry and his anger propelled him to destroy all that is hell.<p>&gt; They are some of the best single player games I&#x27;ve played in years, but I was there with Id since the Commander Keen games and this does not feel like a Doom game to me.<p>I have some mixed feelings about Doom Eternal as it sometimes feels like a puzzle and bit gamey. But Doom 2016 is quite literally a modernised version of Doom 1.')
