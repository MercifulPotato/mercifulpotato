Just comparing Europe to the US:<p>The US has both the major desktop&#x2F;laptop CPU designers, as well as both desktop&#x2F;laptop GPU designers. Of the three major desktop&#x2F;laptop OSes, two are American, and the last doesn&#x27;t belong to any particular country, but the primary creator moved from Europe to the US permanently.<p>The two major smartphone OSes are made by American companies. Two biggest browsers, again, Americans. Maybe three, if you count Mozilla (though Samsung is probably around there as well).<p>Huge internet&#x2F;software tech companies that consumers interact with? Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple are all American. Europe has no equivalent to these, all they can boast is a few smaller ones like Spotify, or business facing giants like SAP (equivalent to that in the US would probably be like Oracle or IBM).<p>While obviously Europe doesn&#x27;t have a complete dearth of local software, in terms of major consumer hits, especially the kind that get play outside of the region they originated in -- not much of that going on.<p>Also, I work at Google Munich, and it&#x27;s pretty telling how rare it is for people here to get &#x27;poached&#x27; by other local tech companies. It happened to a few people I knew...to go to Lyft&#x27;s Munich office. Other than that, I can&#x27;t think of any. When it comes to enticing engineers, there just aren&#x27;t any German tech companies that play in the same league as Google.')
