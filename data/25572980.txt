That just changes the size of your numbers.  For the sake of comparison the threshold just needs to be set somewhere that doesn&#x27;t result in a huge number of states being  crammed at one end of the spectrum.<p>The problem is the flattening of urban and rural within state like others have said.  A suburb of NYC may as well be a foreign country compared to a suburb of Buffalo.<p>Of course if you&#x27;re gonna doll out aid based on the absolute number you should set a sane threshold but that doesn&#x27;t really matter for the purposes of this discussion.')
