Bug bounties take the charity business model, you disclose everything you know, they get to fixing it and when they&#x27;re done they may inform you that they&#x27;ll write you a check.<p>Disclosure at this point is moot, you&#x27;d only look like an ass and probably wouldn&#x27;t get the check.<p>What you&#x27;re describing is more like a darknet marketplace when you describe the vulnerability in the fewest words possible and never giving up code until the Bitcoin deposit is confirmed. I seriously doubt most companies would deal with an individual like this, it&#x27;s closer to blackmail than it is a bug bounty.')
