Necessary initially, but if you don&#x27;t shift up into higher gears, you&#x27;re probably not doing it right, and not getting as far as fast as you probably should.  If I&#x27;m tired, it&#x27;s necessarily because I&#x27;m mismanaging my work and time, and that&#x27;s a signal it&#x27;s time to step back and figure out what&#x27;s wrong.<p>Some people are really good at that initial torque boost on projects and can sustain it longer than others, but if work doesn&#x27;t get easier it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re doing something wrong.<p>From a market-fit perspective, I think startups that drive around in first gear never get very far either. Things are only hard because we&#x27;re being stupid. Nobody ever looks at a person driving a ferrari and thinks, &quot;wow, they must have washed a <i>lot</i> of dishes to afford that car,&quot; and yet we still think &quot;if I just wash these dishes hard enough I&#x27;ll drive a ferrari one day.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m guilty of this as much as anyone, but burnout is my body intervening to tell me I&#x27;m being stupid.')
