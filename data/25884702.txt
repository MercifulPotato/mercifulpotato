What matters is velocity changes. It&#x27;s about 10km&#x2F;s to get into orbit, and 5km&#x2F;s or so to transit to Mars. Coming back is a lot easier because Mars has less gravity and atmosphere, and you don&#x27;t need to bring as much stuff back. So maybe let&#x27;s call it 20km&#x2F;s total? Fuel has mass, so it takes fuel to bring fuel. If you were to bring all the fuel you needed along, it&#x27;s probably going to end up being 5-10x the fuel for getting just to low earth orbit. Either you build one giant rocket, or more realistically you launch a few smaller rockets. Alternatively, if you can manufacture fuel on Mars, you only need to take along 15km&#x2F;s worth of fuel. A single falcon heavy launch could probably handle that.<p>Said another way, such a mission could probably be completed with one or two falcon heavy launches. That&#x27;s basically equivalent to 3-6 falcon 9&#x27;s worth of fuel, and a falcon 9&#x27;s fuel cost is something like $200k. So, $600k-$1200k in fuel.<p>A spaceship system actually suitable for going to Mars would probably use cheaper fuel than falcon heavy. By the time it&#x27;s actually built, though, inflation and politics will have made the fuel expensive again. So my best guess is a cool $1million!')
