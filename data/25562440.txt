And you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s the absolute nightmare of people in SF who say they want non-market housing, precisely because it means new housing and new buildings.<p>However, it&#x27;s a generally popular idea, that if put to a majority vote could pass. It&#x27;s individual small groups that would stop it, because city politics are highly undemocratic and controlled by small factions.<p>However, there&#x27;s hope at the state level to make this possible. I&#x27;m hopeful that in the coming legislative session there will be some serious attempts at state-level public housing to alleviate our desperate shortage.')
