Profit is the ability to invest more in R&amp;D, attract more investors, scale faster, advertise more. Unless your consumers care enough to only support you if you pay taxes, or you can get substantially more productive employees by paying taxes, or some other advantage in the marketplace by paying taxes, paying taxes when your competition does not is an albatross around your neck. And if your morality creates enough albatrosses around your neck your company will either fold or be eternally small as your competitors without such restrictions have higher efficiency. So it’s a no-brainer in that any company that gets to the scale where spending millions on lawyers is appropriate is already of this mindset.<p>This is why laws need to be crafted to not give companies the benefit of the doubt when it comes to acting in the best interest of society. Less because it is impossible for a company to be moral in a vacuum, but because if being immoral is allowed and advantageous inevitably the immoral company will out compete the moral one. (Of course it can be hard to agree on what moral is. Some say that taxes are immoral after all.)')
