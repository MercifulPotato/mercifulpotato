And “shipping” good lessons, close connections with students, and great results is rarely recognised, and doesn’t help you get a job in the future. (It might help you look better compared to someone publishing equally as many or impactful papers, but it’s the papers first).<p>The other thing that this publish-regularly mentality can prevent is very long-term forward-looking projects - for some problems it is not clear what an answer should even look like, let alone how to get there. The closest thing to compare it to might be starting a new company - perhaps it takes 6 to 12 months to work on a product enough to start selling it. This is time that people simply don’t have in some academic fields, where they will be seen as underperforming, so it discourages these long-term projects entirely.')
