Metrics with a purpose other than surveillance and budget would be good.<p>However, most metrics I have encountered and helped impleme t in the past, especially in the finance industry, fall in that category. Boxticking and task-management because there is a mentality of cutting corners.<p>Bullshit Jobs is an essay, not a research paper. It points at a globally felt phenomenon in the workplace. People&#x27;s impressions, no matter how subjective, still imply something is afoot.<p>Also, a book pointing at an issue is not obligated in providing a solution. Criticizing a system has its own merit. It outlines an issue maybe someone else will then be able to elucidate.')
