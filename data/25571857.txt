Much like watching Friends or even more &quot;recent&quot; shows like How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) where the characters undergo their lives in a big expensive city but not work constantly.<p>It&#x27;s hard to suspend belief on those shows given the shenanigans they do. How on earth did they live in that apartment (Friends&#x2F;HIMYM), or live in such a large single family home on one income? The shows end up having to address their own disbelief with rent control (Friends) or the Frank Grimes episode (The Simpsons).')
