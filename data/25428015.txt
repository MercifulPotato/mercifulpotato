I&#x27;ve lived in southern or northern california for almost 20 years and can pretty much run 365 days a year and bike almost that much. I HAVE run in snow storms in Illinois and North Carolina and heat waves in Houston and Austin, TX so my range of &quot;comfort&quot; is definitely a bit wider than the average person but in general the whole of California has near perfect weather IMO though it does get very hot as you go inland in the summer.')
