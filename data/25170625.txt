I think vertical Ag is for hostile environments like Middle East&#x2F;desert. Japan&#x2F;no labour ...maybe even where it dumps snow most of the time. Or entirely different like..I don’t know..Shetland islands.<p>Hydroponics is more efficient. Aquaponics more eco friendly&#x2F;organic. Even hoop house growing&#x2F;under shade can be automated.<p>The issue would be labour in the US. I am in field ag and in my opinion, we need more small swarming ag robotics ..less ai..more to replace weeding&#x2F;harvest manhours.<p>Plenty&#x2F;Nate Storey design is very elegant. Very smart. I am not sure it can scale. But they say that it can..should be interesting')
