If you couldn&#x27;t beat windows 7, the OS that ran for decade with no major upgrades to functionality, at the desktop game how are you going to beat an OS that changes faster than we can keep up as admins?<p>We all cried in 2016, 17, 18 when ms was patching too fast, releasing too fast, now they are steady pushing a semi-annual build with little problems. There will no windows 11 and because Linux is OOS, with no central model for support, Microsoft will continue to dominate the desktop space. It&#x27;s just Windows now, not ubuntu, arch, mint, red hat, deb, gnu.<p>3 main gripes:<p>Cost - sure? MS doesn&#x27;t really make money here it wouldn&#x27;t cost much to ship windows to the planet for free.\nForced updates - again 3 years ago yes big problem, last year still killing my nic drivers, future 3-5 years? Unlikely that we will even notice them, we are down to a monthly reboot.<p>Telemetry - not going away.')
