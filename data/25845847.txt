But you&#x27;ll still be able to get this screenshot!<p>Having said that, they have USB working, which is quite an effort, although I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s an IPCore that a driver already existed for, so it was a simple matter of figuring out memory mappings etc.    With USB working, you can make a very usable system, because pretty much any peripheral will work over USB.')
