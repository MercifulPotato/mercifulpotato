At my company, every goal has a “POC” – point of contact aka “owner” or “partner”.  I think you should add a partner to each goal – a person who will rate you on the objective.  The objectives are what matter. e.g. if you hit 6 hrs time with gf, but she still thinks you are rubbish , you haven’t made any progress on the “strengthen relationships with gf” objective.')
