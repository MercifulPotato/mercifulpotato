It&#x27;s the little things -- if I start the motion to &quot;show desktop&quot; by spreading my fingers apart on the touchpad, windows will seamlessly start the motion with my fingers. If I decide to abort the gesture with my fingers, windows on the screen match my motion exactly. I can also customize gestures like expose, mission control, desktop switching, etc. to my liking by assigning different gestures to different commands -- I&#x27;ve never used a Windows laptop or any kind of linux environment with that kind of customization, though I&#x27;m sure with sufficient work you could get linux to do something like that.')
