Most learners approximate the voiceless &#x27;th&#x27; with &#x27;f&#x27; (&#x27;fing&#x27;, &#x27;frow&#x27;) and the voiced &#x27;th&#x27; with &#x27;z&#x27; (&#x27;zis fing&#x27;, &#x27;zat fing&#x27;), because they don&#x27;t even know what to do to pronounce the real sound.<p>Even worse, many consonants and vowels have variations between languages even when they are recognized as the same consonant. R is a famous case, but for example, the Slavic and Latin &#x27;t&#x27; sound is harder than the English or German &#x27;t&#x27; - I pronounce my native t with my tongue closer to my teeth than when I&#x27;m speaking English.<p>However, one someone points out the specific differences and helps you practice the right tongue movements, it&#x27;s generally easy to replicate if you&#x27;re pacient and try for a while. There may be exceptions, like learning to roll your R sounds, to vary pitch or learning click sounds (haven&#x27;t tried any of these myself, so maybe they&#x27;re not that hard either).')
