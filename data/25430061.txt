Hans Landa : Yet I assume you don&#x27;t share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?<p>Perrier LaPadite : No.<p>Col. Hans Landa : But they&#x27;re both rodents, are they not? And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don&#x27;t they?<p>Perrier LaPadite : It&#x27;s an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.<p>Col. Hans Landa : Ha! However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to walk in here right now, as I&#x27;m talking, would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?<p>Perrier LaPadite : Probably not.<p>Col. Hans Landa : I didn&#x27;t think so. You don&#x27;t like them. You don&#x27;t really know why you don&#x27;t like them; all you know is you find them repulsive.')
