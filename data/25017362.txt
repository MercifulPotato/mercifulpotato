Your municipality sends and counts your vote at least in Switzerland. From what I‘ve read here, it sounds a lot of European countries have a similar process as ours.<p>In Switzerland every adult citizen get‘s a ballot sent home for every election and referendum. I don‘t know of there‘s a way to unsubscribe. You can send it by mail or take it to the polls on election day.<p>I can‘t imagine why you would restrict voting more than that (except for political games).')
