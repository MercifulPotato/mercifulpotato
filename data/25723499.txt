Any time protests turn into riots, there are many who will jump at labelling the entire movement as being full of thugs and criminals. Your own words could be used to describe exactly how the BLM protests were viewed by the right. And actually, you yourself only mentioned &quot;riots&quot; without any acknowledgement of how there were far more peaceful protesters in that movement. Hint: the peaceful protests aren&#x27;t as exciting, so they&#x27;re not on the news as much.<p>So now am I supposed to feel sorry for the peaceful Trump protesters who are being mislabeled unfairly? Please. I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of diversity in those crowds, and somehow I think they are still going to be represented pretty well by their elected leaders going forward. Cry me a river.')
