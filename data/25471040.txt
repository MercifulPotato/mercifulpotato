That doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t go back to working on those objectives in the future but they needed SOMETHING that would work to show mrna promise.  Vaccines you only have to take once or twice so the side effects of immune response aren&#x27;t too bad and you have an immune response to a vaccine anyways.')
