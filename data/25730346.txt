It is true that it the freedom of companies to ban people like they want to, as it is for any other side.<p>I don&#x27;t think even the last election was a success for democrats to be honest, it was a pretty close call. But that is another metric. Trump became president and had his full term. I don&#x27;t think past you would call even the current situation a success, you just reduced your expectations.<p>The supposed fact checkers had a clear bias and couldn&#x27;t establish trust. That will take some time to get back and I doubt democrats will have success with programs that require any form of solidarity because you still define yourself as opposition to Trump. There is still a huge and solidified division. Hard to govern, but we will see.')
