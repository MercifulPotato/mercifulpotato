Yesterday I went to my doctor just for a COVID test, as I will be traveling over the holidays. He asked me to wait to get the test until the last possible minute as my insurance will only pay for ONE test. Any additional tests will be $750 out of pocket. I would hope that we could work out cheap, rapid testing first, before deciding the price of a vaccine.')
