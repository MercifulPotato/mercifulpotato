In a civil engineering project such as a bridge, the requirements may be written down by the customer, but the engineering design of the bridge is entirely the responsibility of a single architect. You can pretty much bet that the city council who bought the bridge doesn&#x27;t know a thing about physics or engineering, so if the bridge falls down it has to be the architect&#x27;s fault (assuming that it was built according to the plan). This gives the architect the power to say &quot;no&quot; to the customer.')
