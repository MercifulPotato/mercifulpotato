I care about the safety of innocent people, including myself and my family. You can feel like violent prisoners are subhuman, that&#x27;s fine. But insisting on institutions that net out your retribution -- even at the expense of reducing recidivism and saving future victims of violent crimes -- isn&#x27;t that a tad selfish?<p>It&#x27;s entirely consistent to both feel that violent criminals are subhuman and also realize that crafting institutions which treat them as such is net harmful to the rest of society.')
