I learned initially on QNX so the &#x2F;args used to drive me nuts. So needless to say, I used that one.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure though that I learned about it straight from the DOS manual, which was a 2-ring binder with a LOT of pages in it. I learned Assembler from its chapters on the DEBUG command. (Needless to say, MASM and TASM were godsends once I discovered them!)<p>AVAILDEV is completely new to me though. That one I&#x27;m pretty sure wasn&#x27;t in the manual, because it also seems like one I would have naturally gravitated to.<p>Great video. Blast from the past with something &quot;new&quot; besides.<p>BTW: You could put CON in <i>any</i> directory name and it would reference the console. It didn&#x27;t matter if it was &#x2F;DEV&#x2F;CON or &#x2F;BANANA&#x2F;CON, it worked just the same. There were a few pranks played using this &quot;driver&quot; quirk.')
