Both these two innovations have really bound the software world together - compatability these days is really at the TCP level (eg. docker and APIs) and allows for a massive diversity of architectures (kafka, istio, materialize.io, IFTTT, Macrometa etc) - the bar has moved in a way.<p>Having said that, some of the missed opportunities of note are:<p>MINT: Gem and Tos weren&#x27;t really developed much by Atari, but they did buy in MINT which has preemptive multi tasking and memory protection. With the Aes being retargetable (graphic cards), gdos vector fonts and postscript printing, tcp and lan networking stacks, shell, global shortcut system, posix compatibility and multi-user capabilities, it managed to evolve Tos to effectively a unix with usable desktop aka a standard OSX or linux-on-the-desktop well before now.<p>Secondly, choosing A2 instead of Android would have been huge. A compiled multithreaded, multitasking self-hosted OS with GC, zooming UI, 3x faster than Linux and small enough for one person to understand (250k kernel).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.research-collection.ethz.ch&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;20.500.11850&#x2F;147091&#x2F;eth-26082-02.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.research-collection.ethz.ch&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;handle&#x2F;20....</a><p>One other benefit here would have been no Google-Oracle lawsuit to mess with API copyright :)')
