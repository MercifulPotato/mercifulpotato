My grandpas, which lived to 96, 98 and 101, didn&#x27;t eat much fish either. Lots of veggies though. One of my grandfathers died young due to a heart condition. \nAll of them were regularly checking their health and doing regular blood tests. I can confirm we don&#x27;t see getting tested as being &quot;obsessed with our health&quot; but as a good (and for many, not very pleasurable) practice, part of the &quot;preventing an illness is better than curing it&quot; philosophy. Having cheap&#x2F;free healthcare also helps.')
