These companies are so large they launch TONS of stuff to avoid being out innovated. Echo took off for example, fire phone flopped, book store did well, AWS took off, I&#x27;m sure some other things flopped.<p>But AWS just does not seem to actually kill their compute products. So my example was simply SimpleDB I&#x27;m not sure is even available in console anymore, but it all still worked (a few years ago - they&#x27;ve probably killed it by now I guess).')
