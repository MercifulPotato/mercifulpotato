I have been considering adding Typescript recently. Mainly as I sometimes encounter bugs on e.g. an options object where a property is named incorrectly. That tends to lead to hours of debugging, so it&#x27;d be reasonable to start using it.<p>Re: third party code: I&#x27;m not against third-party libs. But what I tend to prefer is having control over my code. This makes me faster in building and maintaining. I&#x27;m a solo freelancer. I can&#x27;t afford to wait three days for a PR upstream to be merged.<p>Also, I like to create my own little dependency. That way I have a way to create separate and loosely coupled APIs (shareable) and control.')
