I ask this genuinely, because I have a tendency to feel these tools only negatively impact people who use them in stress-creating ways. That, however, feels like victim blaming. There&#x27;s a difference between a using a circular saw dangerously and a circular saw that is MADE with electrical failures that shock you. Let me give the example of MY use so you can contrast it for me to help me understand.<p>I use GMail, Google Search, Youtube Twitter, Amazon, and Facebook.<p>I&#x27;m not thrilled about FB but it lets me keep tabs on friends. Sometiems I interact with a few people who are friends but sucked in by a lot of the disinformation around, so I try to engage with them sometimes but not often. I also spend maybe 15 minutes a day on it, tops.<p>Twitter never stresses me, I don&#x27;t follow toxic people, just friends, entertainers, tech people and such. Again, maybe 15-30 minutes a day, tops.<p>I get a lot of satisfaction from Youtube, I even pay for premium so I don&#x27;t get ads, and follow a bunch of great creators.<p>Amazon&#x27;s pricing and delivery are great. that makes me happy. I just make sure not to by crap&#x2F;scam products and I&#x27;m good. I use Amazon Music every day, and their video streaming is great too (although they need to stop changing the name).<p>Google Search is by far the best, IMO, and saves me hours every day.<p>I have my personal domain go to gmail, and it makes managing ages of email a breeze.<p>So I can&#x27;t see a way in which ditching any of those would benefit me, and aside from Facebook, I feel NOT using them would cause me more stress, or less enjoyment.<p>I&#x27;d love to know how you find leaving them has benefitted you.')
