But I also understand that this can take years and lots of money.  Especially if the signature service is in a different country.  So-called identity theft is a real problem.<p>My particular concern is that I believe I&#x27;m entering into a tenancy but then discover, due to some bug in the software, that the landlord never actually entered the agreement.  At this point the landlord can legally evict me if, say, he gets a better offer.  What can I do about this?<p>Edit to explain a detail of English law: this is a lease renewal.  It isn&#x27;t necessary for my continued occupation, but without it I have no security of tenure.')
