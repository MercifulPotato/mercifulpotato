If your case lacks standing then there is literally no evidence for it that could work.<p>What they were doing there, of course, was trying to use SCOTUS to relitigate claims that had already been shot down in state courts.<p>That all of the fraud stuff is bullshit should have been obvious from soon after the beginning.  The claim of fraud was made, but the evidence to justify the claims was a constantly revolving circus of nonsense.   It shows they reached the position that fraud must have occurred not because they had evidence of fraud, but because they didn&#x27;t like the result.<p>I like how the courts have treated Trump so brutally.  His thing is complete disregard of facts or reason.  The courts are the polar opposite of that, so of course he failed utterly there.  His normal modus operandi of dishonesty is something judges are there to destroy.')
