And just like cattle and other ruminants, one of the by-products of this breakdown is methane.[..]<p>[..]Globally, it is estimated that termites are responsible for about one to three per cent of all methane emissions. It may sound small, but that&#x27;s up to 20 million tonnes of methane each year coming out the rear ends of these humble insects.<p>However, unlike us humans, termites have a built-in filter system in their dwellings to remove this greenhouse gas before it&#x27;s emitted into the wider atmosphere.[...]')
