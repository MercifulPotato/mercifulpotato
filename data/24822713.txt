Apple is a good target because they are highly visible. We should be thinking about earths natural resources and how quickly we’re turning them to trash whether it’s cheap imports through Amazon or the major companies. Saying we shouldn’t criticize Apple because they’re just one company in a sea of trash I think misses the mark.')
