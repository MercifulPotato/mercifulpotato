Whoever submits a pull request closing out the issue earns the bounty.<p>Imagine this scenario:<p>John files an issue on Project Foo, submits that issue to Rysolv, and pays some money to &quot;contribute&quot; to getting it fixed.<p>Joan sees the issue filed on Project Foo&#x27;s issue tracker, and submits a patch.<p>According to the statement from the parent comment I replied to, that money would be paid to Joan. But Joan has no existing relationship with Rysolv, and thus they have no way to pay her for the fix.<p>So what happens to that money?')
