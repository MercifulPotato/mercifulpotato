According to its front page they are &quot;tools to improve your workflow&quot;, but I just feel out of the loop and honestly slightly confused about what this is or why I would want to use it. I guess I&#x27;m officially old now. Oh well, back to neovim :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;developers&#x2F;github-marketplace&#x2F;requirements-for-listing-an-app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;developers&#x2F;g...</a>')
