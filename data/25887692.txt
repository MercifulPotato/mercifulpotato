The pattern is always the same: it&#x27;s small issue, nothing to worry about, we know what&#x27;s going on( or about to find out).<p>Last week I was bored,so ended up testing so cold google exploits. There are endless numbers of educational institutions with systems so crap that it&#x27;s hard to believe. It took 15 min to find confidential salary data, various documents, messages, etc. Interestingly enough, most were US schools. I can only imagine what people with skills could do, instead of just googling,like me.')
