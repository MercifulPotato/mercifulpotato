I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I saw one in the city generally speaking, as they don&#x27;t seem to be extremely popular.<p>There used to be a way bigger problem with enforcing of scooters in the bike paths, though that is now way less of an issue, as far as I can tell. The only scooters legally allowed on bike lanes are the ones limited to 25kmph. I still find them dangerous, but considerably less so than how it was a few years back.')
