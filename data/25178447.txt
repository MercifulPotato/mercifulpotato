Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=[25178545], score=None, time=1606060649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178326, text='&gt; Evading taxes with cash tips for food service workers is not the way to accomplish that.<p>I can only choose among the options I am given, and the ideal system is not one of them. I can either choose to tip someone, and maybe they don’t pay taxes on it, which increases the tax burden for everyone else, or I can choose not to tip someone, which means that person suffers just for the unfortunate coincidence that I am their customer.<p>Let’s say that the normal tip is $5. If I choose to tip someone and they don’t pay taxes, perhaps their marginal tax rate is 12% and this is 60¢ in lost tax revenue.<p>Given a choice between “60¢ in federal tax revenue” or “$5 in income for a low-wage worker”, the correct moral choice becomes stark clear, in my mind.')
