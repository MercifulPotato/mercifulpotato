Item(by='vsareto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608145989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446792, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t the point to train your brain to think in a certain way<p>You might get that through other methods besides trig, meaning trig isn&#x27;t strictly necessary -- it&#x27;s just one option among potentially many. The hard part is proving efficacy and efficiency of each option.<p>CompSci interview questions go way beyond loops, conditionals and recursion though, such that if you don&#x27;t already know some secret sauces, it&#x27;s unlikely to get the best case solution that the interviewer wants.<p>The other thing throwing this off is interviews are looking for different grades of solutions or maybe just looking at your problem solving&#x2F;communication skills, e.g. you can fail to find the best known solution but still get a job because of your reasoning.<p>So in this way, the algorithms &amp; data structures interviews can sometimes be used to test knowledge, or test problem solving ability, or both.<p>The interview stopped being a test of &quot;if you can do this job&quot; and instead seeks to find a correlation backed up by some research that says &quot;people that prepare, study, and do well at this interview also do well at this company&quot;. Similar research meant that they needed to stop asking brain teaser questions because it wasn&#x27;t a good indicator of success.')
