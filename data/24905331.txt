There are two distinct GPU Acceleration technologies at work here:<p>- for videos<p>- for website rendering<p>AFAIK the video acceleration part is the big problem as the issue was ignored for many years by the browser vendors. For rendering websites most browser should do just fine, some hardware-browser combinations might be exceptions though.<p>I also wonder what you mean by Firefox has no user profiles, because Firefox has a profile concept too. Be default it doesn&#x27;t ask you, but when you start it with `firefox --ProfileManager` you will see what I mean. I don&#x27;t like messing with the Profile Manager every time, so I just have different Icons for starting different Profiles (e.g. Music --&gt; Spotify, Movies --&gt; Amazon &amp; Netflix, etc.).<p>Currently there are just two websites for which I have to use Chromium:<p>1. Geforce Now, officially Linux is not supported, but with Chromium it does work when you change your user-agent<p>2. Binance, for whatever reason their login capture doesn&#x27;t work with Firefox')
