If you only play against worse players, you don&#x27;t learn. If you play against masters or computers at full strength, you get demotivated. In literature this strength handicap doesnt matter, in fact you need to read a lot of great autors, and write a lot. I guess you must read more than write. But you also need feedback, so writing alone is not as effective to get better over time.')
