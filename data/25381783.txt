AirBnb constantly broke city laws, they have outrageous cleaning fees, you pay 1.5x the price with fees. DoorDash stole tips from their drivers.<p>However YC turns a blind eye and praises them for their growth.<p>Reading Paul Graham’s recent essay have been disappointing. It doesn’t paint the full picture nor does it consider 2nd order effects.<p>Recent DoorDash and Airbnb posts have quite a bit of survivor bias in them.')
