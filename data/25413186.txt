Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607916259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412679, text='Some companies (and even some individuals) are of the opinion that, since they are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;smart&quot; or spend $x amount for &quot;security&quot;, they aren&#x27;t going to get compromised. Even worse are the ones who still concentrate their efforts on their firewalls and assume that, inside the network, all is well. They&#x27;re the ones whose networks and systems are going to be completely and thoroughly &quot;pwn3d&quot; when someone does eventually get in.<p>Nowadays, the general attitude amongst the &quot;experts&quot; is to assume that you&#x2F;your company&#x2F;organization <i>WILL</i> -- at some point -- get compromised and to, instead, plan for that eventuality and work to minimize the damage an attacker can do once they have gotten a foothold inside your network.<p>That means doing just the things you mentioned: preventing oateral movement, privilege escalation, and exfiltration of data, concentrating on RPO&#x2F;RTO (a.k.a., getting things back up and running as quickly as possible once the shit hits the fan), and so on.<p>I&#x27;ve certainly not heard of anyone recommending that software and systems <i>NOT</i> be updated. There&#x27;s only so much you can do, though. You can make sure that all of your software is only coming from &quot;trusted sources&quot;, verify the published checksums (if any) and attached digital signatures, scan files with an up-to-date anti-virus (although, nowadays, that may not actually be worth anything), and yet <i>STILL</i> get hit by something like this.<p>So, you do what you can, try to protect yourself and your organization as best you can, and prepare yourself for when the day comes that it&#x27;s your name in the headlines instead of the Commerce Department and Treasury Department.<p>(Personally, I&#x27;m of the opinion that if a nation-state wants in your network, they <i>will</i> -- one way or another -- get in. I&#x27;m looking forward to the day that hosts don&#x27;t have a default route, are blocked at egress, and all &quot;external&quot; traffic has to go through firewalls and proxies before it can get out.)')
