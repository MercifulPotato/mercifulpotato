If you think hitting some metrics on a annual review is hard because it&#x27;s BS, managing the expectations of 4 different stakeholders is a whole different league of dealing with &quot;BS&quot;.<p>Or to put it a different way, if you&#x27;re entering consulting to escape politics you are in for a world of hurt.<p>*this mostly apply to the finding your own clients and running whole project version of consulting. The just showing up as an embedded 1099 worker by applying to or getting recommended to a job does involve a lot less politics.')
