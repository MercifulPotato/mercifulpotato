Item(by='moeris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610912687, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813287, text='&gt; I think one of the advantages of a large&#x2F;durable ecosystem is that it lets me worry less about problems I don&#x27;t yet have.<p>That&#x27;s true.  If you&#x27;re finding numerous workflow problems with neovim, it&#x27;ll probably be true of Kakoune, as well.<p>&gt; &gt; Kakoune just feels better integrated with the environment\n&gt;\n&gt; Out of curiosity, is this an argument for enjoyment or productivity?<p>Both, though it&#x27;s a more persuasive argument for productivity.  Because it&#x27;s easier to integrate with the environment, those workflow problems you mention can be solved by delegating to the environment, in some cases.  For example, kakoune delegates to the environment for window management -- so things like resizing windows and switching between them is handled through tmux for me.  Obviously, though, that&#x27;s could be a poor substitution for some dedicated solutions in the editor.  But overall, I prefer it, as it allows me to get familiar with unix utilities, which are useful in a wider range of applications.  It also means there isn&#x27;t an arcane scripting language associated with using the editor.  I have a thing against vimscript.<p>&gt; differences in keybindings are also worth a mention<p>I suppose.  Having used vim for years, I was able to pick up the keybindings relatively quickly (&lt; 1 day); they&#x27;re almost identical.  The main difference, that the selection comes before the action, also makes it easier to pick up.<p>But, yeah, that muscle memory is a loss.  I find myself trying to do multiple selections and use kakoune keybindings in bash vi-mode, often.')
