This was a SNAP-19C device, primarily used for Nimbus satellites, where, of course, fans could not be used. A manual is available [1], where it mentions an operating temperature of 380°F (193°C) in space, and 260°F (127°C) in the atmosphere (presumably in an environment around standard sea level temperature and pressure; the air near the top of Nanda Devi is less dense but also colder, and presumably it is often windy.) I guess it would be like standing next to an operating stove (though, of course, in mountaineering clothing.)<p>The manual also warns, when checking it out, against letting the temperature change too fast: no more than 35°F (19.5°C) in 15 minutes. And don&#x27;t have it assembled without an electrical load, or it will overheat.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of whether the electronics were fan-cooled, but an RTG is so thermally inefficient that its own waste heat must dominate that dissipated by any device it powers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osti.gov&#x2F;biblio&#x2F;4513086" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osti.gov&#x2F;biblio&#x2F;4513086</a>')
