What we&#x27;ve all encountered more often: founders who stubbornly don&#x27;t talk to users as some sort of half-understood adherence to the biography of Steve Jobs. And then their product fails. If they had only tried a different way -- I don&#x27;t know, talk to the people who might pay them? -- they could have avoided complete failure. It&#x27;s not as glamorous as magically stumbling on a good idea, perhaps, and requires extra work, but it&#x27;s often a more viable path for most of us.')
