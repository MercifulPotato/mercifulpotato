Item(by='emilecantin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607615299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371232, text='It seems people are giving way too much credit to Blue Origin; they haven&#x27;t even sent hardware to orbit yet. They have a bunch of cool paper rockets, but they haven&#x27;t achieved much beyond New Shepard (and that rocket has only done test flights). They are not even in the same league.<p>ULA on the other hand is much more accomplished. Tory Bruno seems like a cool dude (he even comments on &#x2F;r&#x2F;SpaceXMasterRace!), and his factory tour with SmarterEveryDay (on YouTube) was very instructive. However, they seem to have absolutely no regard for costs. You can see it in the factory tour; they machine huge aluminium blocks down into panels for the rocket sides, removing ~90% of the material in the process. How is that cost-effective in terms of time or materials? They send back the chips for recycling, but still. And that&#x27;s not even starting on the reusability angle; SpaceX is currently working on a fully-reusable rocket (and has flown hardware!) when ULA only has vague plans to save the engines at some point on their next rocket.<p>I think the only launch company that could credibly compete on innovation would be Rocket Labs, but I fear they&#x27;re too small and too late to compete commercially; they&#x27;ll probably end up in the &quot;very small sats in weird orbits&quot; niche, as ridesharing on Starship will eat the rest of the small-sat market.')
