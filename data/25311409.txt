Item(by='cyphar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607138492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303666, text='The EU minimum does not include bank holidays. The UK in practice has 20 vacation days (matching the EU minimum) plus 8 public holidays. It&#x27;s just that the law is written that 28 days is the minimum including the 8 public holidays. The net effect is the same.<p>And by that metric, all Australian employees (excluding casual workers) get at least 32 days off a year (20 vacation days, plus 12 or more public holidays). The UK has 28, but that&#x27;s because they have fewer public holidays. Seems like the US is still behind on time off, especially since none of your vacation time is actually guaranteed by law. I hope the situation improves over there.<p>The &quot;at will&quot; work concept (where employees can be fired without notice or compensation) is also very strange to me. That&#x27;s not legal here.')
