I use it every day, but I mostly use composition rather than inheritance.<p>What I was trying to say was that the inheritance based OOP was sold as the ultimate problem solver.<p>We all remember programming classes with Hello World like examples  of Cat inherits from Animal.<p>Problem is of course that in the real world is never that simple so the inheritance based model turned out many times to be a mess because it was applied to problems where it didn’t fit.<p>That doesn’t mean that inheritance based OOP has its place, it does, but that is usually in very specific domains.')
