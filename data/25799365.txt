Item(by='jeswin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610763822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798955, text='Re-rendering for state changes is a fairly easy thing to do, if you&#x27;re willing to accept something like useState&#x2F;setState. It can even be done application-side (without help from the lib). Basically, just wrap all state changes in setState and re-render everytime.<p>Now the optimization I haven&#x27;t done is deciding whether a child needs to re-render when a parent re-renders. Comparing the props seems like a straightforward way to do this, so I&#x27;ll probably spend some time over it today and implement it soon.')
