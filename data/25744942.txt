For me, parler did nothing other than offer an alternative to twitter which is equal shitty.<p>Amazon didn&#x27;t have any publicity regarding this matter until they decided, together with a lot of other megacorps to remove everything associated with parler. Now they have had a lot of publicity, which is in my view very negative since now everyone knows that if you want to host anything that support any other viewpoint than those held by american megacorps you can be removed.<p>I have a hard time understanding how anyone can think this is good publicity.')
