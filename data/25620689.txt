You also don&#x27;t want to overdo it over the long term.<p>If you&#x27;re deficient, many doctors will prescribe some large loading doses, but from the studies I&#x27;ve seen, going above 10,000 IU&#x2F;day over the long term has the potential for hypervitaminosis.  Also from the studies I&#x27;ve seen, 2,000 IU&#x2F;day long-term is enough to prevent deficiency.<p>Lots of people don&#x27;t like Amazon, but you can get a bottle of 250 or so 5000 IU tablets for about $20.  This is enough to last a couple of years at 2000 IU&#x2F;day.  There are few people in the U.S. that cannot afford something that costs $1&#x2F;month.')
