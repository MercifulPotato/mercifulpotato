Item(by='asdfasgasdgasdg', descendants=None, kids=[25328413, 25328220], score=None, time=1607299922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327912, text='Normally with an identity-based API like this, you can put it as a requirement that you must not remove items other than those which actually exist in the collection. Another example of an API that doesn&#x27;t check for presence: c++ iterator-based removal. If you ask a C++ list to remove an iterator element outside its range, it may crash the program. See the exception safety section of this documentation: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cplusplus.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;list&#x2F;list&#x2F;erase&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cplusplus.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;list&#x2F;list&#x2F;erase&#x2F;</a> If you look at most &quot;remove this object from yourself&quot; APIs in low-level code, it behaves this way, because it&#x27;s unnecessarily complex to check for presence when that is a fact the program can condition on instead.')
