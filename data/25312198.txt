I put them amongst the greatest works of Western art of all time.<p>With that in mind I don&#x27;t hold Mozart god-like on a pedestal as many do.  I see him as an ordinary guy with one supreme talent.  The fact that we still have instances of Mozart&#x27;s profane utterings is a reminder to me that in many respects he&#x27;s down at my level of thinking -- and thus human like the rest of us.  For that reason I&#x27;m truly glad that we&#x27;ve not sanitized these particular works and sayings of his from history.<p>The great Swiss theologian Karl Barth was reputed to have said of Mozart that <i>&quot;God overdid the goodness essence when he created Mozart&quot;.</i><p>My take on that would be to exchange &#x27;goodness&#x27; for &#x27;talent&#x27;. \n I&#x27;d add a rider to that however and that&#x27;s that Mozart is widely and lovingly remembered for the sheer joy that his music has brought to millions of music lovers over the past 23 decades since his death. If that translates into <i>&#x27;goodness essence&#x27;</i> then so be it.')
