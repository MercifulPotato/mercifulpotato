If your traffic pattern is very spiky and unpredictable, the burst limit can be a real pain in the neck. It ranges between 500 and 3.000 Lambda instances, depending on the region, and when that threshold is reached it can only spin up 500 more each minute. This is sufficient in most cases, indeed, but it&#x27;s important to be aware of the implications of this limitation before believing that you can throw anything at Lambda and it&#x27;ll just scale up to accommodate any workload.')
