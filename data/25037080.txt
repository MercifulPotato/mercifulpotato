International transfers of money are an on-going source of medium to high-level pain.<p>So I&#x27;m looking at setting up to accept CC payments.<p>Who would you recommend, how long does it take to set up, and what are the associated costs?<p>Many thanks for any replies, I&#x27;m sure lots of people here would find the information interesting, and possibly useful.')
