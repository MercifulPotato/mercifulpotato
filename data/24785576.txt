Which I think makes a little bit more sense when one looks at the state of discourse in the last few years.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691169446&#x2F;democracy-for-realists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691169446&#x2F;de...</a>')
